I want to do something MEANINGFUL with my writing. Something important and new. Often to me this means getting someone to understand something they wouldn't understand if I told it to them directly. And the next thing, I think, is conveying possibility: being a neglected child and homeschooled and cut off. Convey the invisible privilege of access to knowledge.
