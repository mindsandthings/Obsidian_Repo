# Collate processes
1. Review class materials
2. Review class readings
3. Review Do Mi's book
4. Review Evernote checklists



# Features to learn: go through manuals
Goal is to be able to flexibly funnel info, so that I don't have to scroll through irrelevant info. This may include tagging entries as specific kinds of info (names vs not) or as specific kinds of entries (running topics to always check, etc)

## Making notes
### How do I add hidden text?
Macrex: Use a Keyword to add a unique (and hidden) tag (such as {~dp~}) to any entry which should later be considered for double-posting.

### Can I add a hidden field? 
Sky: Text in the special field can be hidden when you view the formatted index, and can be ignored in sorting entries. To configure your index records to have a special last text field preceding the locator field see “Special Last Text Field” on page 211. To suppress the display of this field in the formatted index see “Typography and Punctuation of Headings” on page 179. To ignore the contents of this field when sorting entries see “Field Evaluation Order” on page 145.


## Labeling entries
### How are labels displayed in each software? 

### Can I apply multiple labels to one entry? 

## Grouping entries
### What is the process to do a complex search for each software? How many steps?

### How easy/hard to search by locator range? 

### Can I show/hide based on labels?

### How to manually save a set of entries based on search criteria? Can I ad hoc add other entries to it?

### Is the search lost when I go to another screen? 

### "I want this topic and its parent topics but not its sister topics"


## Merging separate indexes





# Try different indexing protocols
I need to try different indexing protocols. The biggest problem I'm having is getting lost in the middle of performing multiple steps, and I feel pressure to do too much in my head without committing anything to paper, and to produce instantly final index entries. Maybe for a section, I need to easily draft entries into a notepad, or into Excel, with notes next to them. Maybe I need to let myself journal about confusion. 



## Try printing out a pdf and doing Do Mi's tickboxes

## Mark some main headings for "keep filling out" or "probably only local"
