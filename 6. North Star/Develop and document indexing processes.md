# Features to learn: go through manuals
Goal is to be able to flexibly funnel info, so that I don't have to scroll through irrelevant info. This may include tagging entries as specific kinds of info (names vs not) or as specific kinds of entries (running topics to always check, etc)

## Making notes
### How do I add hidden text?
#### Macrex
Use a Keyword to add a unique (and hidden) tag (such as {~dp~}) to any entry which should later be considered for double-posting.

#### Cindex
Add a hidden field with a complicated process. You then have to tab past this field for every entry. You also have to ask it to ignore when sorting records and hide when it displays a formatted index. (211)

#### Sky
Hide text by selecting it and hitting Ctrl+T. Hidden text affects the sort, but does not print. It will display blue. 

The Note Text command causes text to be both ignored and hidden. (Please note that although the text is hidden in the generated index, it is visible in the Grid and Index Pane.) The text will have no effect on the sort order of the index entry it is contained in and will not appear in the generated index. It will, however, appear in the Grid and Index Pane. You apply the Note Text attribute in the same way as you would apply formatting attributes such as Bold or Italic. When you apply the Note Text attribute, the Note text will appear in a different color in the grid. You can change this color using Preferences. Ctrl+Shift+O. 

## Labeling entries
### How are labels displayed in each software? 

### Can I apply multiple labels to one entry? 

## Grouping entries
### What is the process to do a complex search for each software? How many steps?

#### Cindex
You can make a group from any records in the main index window. To do this, select the records you want to work with, then choose New Group from the File menu (also available through the contextual menu Cindex displays when you CONTROL-click or right-click in the main window). Cindex will display just this set of records in the main document window, giving it the title Temporary Group. To restore the view of all records, choose AllRecords from the View menu, or click in the toolbar. To view the group choose Temporary Group from the View menu. The temporary group survives only until you create another group, finish your current session with Cindex, or explicitly make the group permanent (see below).

You can preserve any temporary group as a permanent one. To save the group, first make sure it is on view (if necessary, choose Temporary Group from the View menu), then choose Save Group... from the File menu (or the contextual menu you obtain with CONTROL-click or right-click in the main window). Cindex will display a sheet through which you should provide the name you want to give the group. When you click OK, Cindex will remember the group. Cindex automatically saves information about groups that belong to the index.

Each group you save becomes an item in the Group submenu in the View menu (it is no longer accessible through the Temporary Group item in the View menu). To view a group at any time, select it by name from the submenu. To restore the view of all records, choose All Records. Managing Groups Cindex provides several tools to help you manage groups. For information on these see “Managing Groups” on page 230.

Cindex can find and add to a group all the records that make cross-references to records already in the group.

### How easy/hard to search by locator range? 
#### Macrex

#### Cindex

#### Sky





### Can I show/hide based on labels?
#### Macrex

#### Cindex
Hide records by label by checking a box and checking enable hiding. Those are treated as though they do not exist (you cannot find them by searching).

### How to manually save a set of entries based on search criteria? Can I ad hoc add other entries to it?
#### Macrex

#### Cindex

#### Sky

### Is the search lost when I go to another screen? 
#### Macrex

#### Cindex

#### Sky

### "I want this topic and its parent topics but not its sister topics"
#### Macrex

#### Cindex

## Merging separate indexes
#### Cindex
After having made any necessary adjustments to page numbers, follow these steps to build a master index: 1. Create a new index that will contain the cumulated or combined components. Do not be concerned about the record size; Cindex will re-size the index if necessary when it adds records to it. 2. Open a component index that you want to include in the master index. 3. Select the records you want to include in the master index (choose Select All from the Edit menu if you want to include all records). 4. Drag the records to the main window of the master index. Alternatively, copy the records (choose Copy from the Edit menu), activate the master index (click its main window, or choose it by name from the Window menu), then paste the records (choose Paste from the Edit menu). 5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for each component index.






# Try different indexing protocols
I need to try different indexing protocols. The biggest problem I'm having is getting lost in the middle of performing multiple steps, and I feel pressure to do too much in my head without committing anything to paper, and to produce instantly final index entries. Maybe for a section, I need to easily draft entries into a notepad, or into Excel, with notes next to them. Maybe I need to let myself journal about confusion.
