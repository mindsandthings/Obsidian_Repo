-   Volunteer your indexing services to nonprofit organizations. You may not be paid for these projects, but you will be building a resume of indexing experience.
-   Volunteer in local chapters of indexing organizations. Working with other indexers may be the most effective way to network.
-   Focus on a special skill or professional background you may have. I know of one indexer who was able to parlay her fifteen years working for a well-known environmental group into her first indexing projects on environmental books. An editor may actually be more interested in your special knowledge skills than in your indexing training and experience.

# Practice indexes

do practice indexes of well-indexed books (see the review excerpts in The indexer) and compare your results with theirs

plan to index that one book that two people indexed and wrote about, as a practice document (Inside indexing?)

# Learning about indexing

The April 2002 and October 2005 issues of The indexer feature articles on education for indexing and getting started in indexing.
