# Day summary
gotta do some problemsolving today. for writing. hoping some of itw as from neck ache. 

because god I've been so tired. I think the fatigue is from brain not draining correctly. I kinda do want to look into the lymph thing. find someone who treats it. or will scan for causes or something or at least acknowledge that being predisposed to it is very bad and disruptive 

# Health
finally, fainally, finally got like 3/4 up neck to rotate back left into place and head is draining correctly. that was awful. and kind of scary to put back in. I think it went out on Sunday probably during the stupid escape game, or possibly due to the travel which I think vibrates it out of place. 


# Internal check-in
