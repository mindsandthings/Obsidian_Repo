# Day summary


# Health
Tried Perrin's technique for lymphatic drainage. I do feel somewhat better all over, but that could be the massage. Am going to look into endonasal correction as well, and maybe see someone for a consultation. 

Doing the Hart chart exercises afterward felt different. I also massaged that area some though.
