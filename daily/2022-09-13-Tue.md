Well! I was sitting on the toilet and bent over my phone and raised my right shoulder up and forward and it went pop-pop and everything was back in place, and my low back finally relaxed. Feeling so much better now. 

Stressed over homework and over feeling like I can't bring all the rules together in my head to make good decisions. 

Not sure what I'll be graded on. 

Unhappy dentist wants $209. Connected to canceling my appt? idk. I don't like that we get bills with no info on them. Worried about going tomorrow and losing my cool if it's for canceling and they didn't tell us.
