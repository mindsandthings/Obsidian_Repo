# Day summary
I have a new dual monitor stand! Going to try swapping the positions maybe. Need to get a tray for my regular laptop so I can push it back out of the way to change the orientation of the big monitor. 

# Health
ok. A little head achy. Definitely having abdominal cramps last night. don't know if it period or if back out. Back did go in again nicely a couple times recently. 

# Internal check-in
Anxious about new monitor setup.
