# Day summary
Today I have Chet Chat, coworking, more cowokring, writing call, then date. A busy day. 

I'm just feeling tired and burned out. Like I'm not getting back the mental rewards of being good and careful, but also when I do new and unusual things I'm just tired. Really wish those glasses woudl get here. 

It's like - I've done all this why is it not working? Why do I not have friends and enjoy ahving friends? 

# Health
Doing well on Muldowney, possibly because I've been doing callanetics during the break. Head feels okay-ish. Glasses have come in; really looking forward to them. 

I still feel a bit thick and drainy in my head, but not severely and not stuck like last week. 

Metatarsals hurt way less than yesterday. Staying off them and using shoes in the house helped, I think. 

# Internal check-in
Yep, sure are afraid to check in with ourselves for fear of being asked to spend energy on things that don't soothe us. Problem is lack of energy, you know. And then you suck it in and put it all into whatever project you have going.
