# Day summary
Wrote [an anon ask to chavisory](obsidian://open?vault=obsidian&file=0.%20Inbox%2FMy%20anon%20ask%20to%20Chavisory%20re%20purity%20culture) re purity culture making its way into leftist spaces. I'm anxious and probably wrong. I think I managed to be fairly measured and largely avoid blaming the people who are actually carrying it in and enforcing it, but I don't know that most people would see it like that. 

I may have spent way too long writing it. I guess I was just so happy to see her doing it that I hope it continues. 

# Health
Quitting antihistamines seems to have thinned mucus out without making me drip! It's great! I also bought some echinacea to try.
