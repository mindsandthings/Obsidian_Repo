# Day summary


# Health
On Fridya, I had a brief drainage at the back of my neck that made things feel good, but then it went away again and I felt awful. Today I did a lot of pulling (The thing that finally helped was pulling with my left hand from the back and down on my neck) and got some drainage but also horrible stomach cramping and took famotidine and ibuprofen since it could have bene related to having dumplings even though I just had the crab and pork and a green vegetable like usual (but maybe also I had a fish dumpling? not sure what it was). 

Also back of head felt very good earlier today when I'd rested for several days but now it feels awful again.
