Can't seem to get Alfred daily note thing working unless I manually input the filepath each time for some reason. It doesn't update. 

I guess it just takes a while to update after I create the note. 

And it isn't switching to the note, just adding to it if it's open. That's a problem. 

Had my coaching session today for the [[my notes on top 5 strengths (strengths class)]] course. [[coaching call - 2022 08 28 - Strengths for Writers - Susan Bischoff]]  I'm a little disappointed the info wasn't more novel, but also relieved that it was at all helpful and that she seemed to understand where I was coming from.
