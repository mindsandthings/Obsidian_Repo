Yesterday: about an hour after chocolate and pizza hot pocket, got increasingly tight face/head/neck. Wound up taking dandelion tea, which helped with pressure but doesn't give me the resilient feeling high-dose B1 did. 

I did have to take a clonazepam to sleep. I need to put down my book when I take my meds. 

Took 600mg B1 today for the first time at 7:15. Now it's 10. I still feel face tight; some of that could be teeth stuff from chewies. I do feel a bit better though.  The first time I tried B1 the benefits kicked in in the late afternoon, so it may not have started yet. 

Also, eysterday about an hour after the tea my back skin was itchy.
