# Day summary


# Health
Got back to go in by in morning, using left arm into body to push base of rib upward. I think that is clearly what was fucking me up when I lay down at night, and causing abdominal cramping. 

8:30pm: went out for a walk, started feeling a little ill after trying to focus in teh distance (or maybe was just the walking not sure) andafter got in, head started draining again.
