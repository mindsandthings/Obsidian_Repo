# Day summary
Still the possibility of hanging onto the Senate. Overall, Democrats did better than expected, but still far less well than we ought to have. Senate is down to three races and we're going to have another fucking runoff probably. Good because Michael's team can do research, but bad because we might not know who controls the senate for a month. Even though Warnock is doing better thank god. 

Some of yesterday's desperation was due to back ache but I'm guessing not all, a lot genuinely was indexing and the horrifying unprofessionalism of that woman. 

Need to work on strengths again, so that Strategic is getting some positive feedback, Responsibility doesn't feel like everything is an unmeetable task, and Learner has something to do. Woudl be good for Input to have stuff to do too.

Tired tired tired

But: pushing something in my neck popped something in my mid-low-back into place, fucking finally, and the headache I've had for the last ~4 days seems to be actually disappearing now, plus I can sit up straight again.
