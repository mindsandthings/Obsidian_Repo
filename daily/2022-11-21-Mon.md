# Day summary
Dreamed this morning that I went to visit some Deaf and he talked at me in a loud space but was patient when I couldn't hear and then he asked me to look after his family flag (as in, be a caretaker of his tradition). It was very painfully on the nose, in terms of dreams about being accepted by stigmatized people. I spent a while in bed after I woke up thinking about that, and also about how I would expect most Deaf people to look down on me for being neurodivergent but also to look down on me for being a member of a privileged majority. 

Generally speaking, there's a paradox there, a sleight of hand where the more marginalized you are the more you will be reduced to your privilege in order to exclude you. I tried coming up with a name for it (the "paradox of privilege"?) but nothing I found really hit it. Maybe "the paradox of intersectionality"? 

The paradox of intersectional spaces is that they really, really want to reduce people to their privilege. 

At any rate, I do hear the message from my subconscious loud and clear—we want to find somewhere stigmatized enough to accept us!—but life is not set up to allow this to happen, because they don't want to accept our awkwardness.
