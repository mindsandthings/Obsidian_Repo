Yesterday something in my jaw/skull that was unusual went back into place - something behind my top palate maybe, and then my jaw cracked too. And now my Co/C1 feels way way more stable - I think it fixed the constant sliding out of place I've been having recently, along with the lower back issues I've been having for months. And possibly the issue where I couldn't lie down on my right side in bed and got headaches lying down, which I've been having for years. It's amazing. I wonder how long it's really been out, and what originally did it. 

I can also focus more stably on thigns in the distance now. Not binocular-wise, but as in, not wobbling back and forth wise.
