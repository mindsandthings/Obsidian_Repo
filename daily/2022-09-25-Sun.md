# Day summary
Did some stuff. A mild struggle but not awful. Not looking forward to having to contact Mom about 6-months eldercare stuff. Not sure how to do it either. blujhhhhhhhhh



# Health
Woke up feeling fine on left side all down, but achy on right side. Did Perrin technique again last night and have sometimes done part of it during the day; it seems to help fairly clearly and fairly quickly. 


# Internal check-in
Already feeling resistance to this. Not clear on why it's the problem it is, it just becomes subtly aversive.
