# Day summary
Did some stuff. A mild struggle but not awful. Not looking forward to having to contact Mom about 6-months eldercare stuff. Not sure how to do it either. blujhhhhhhhhh

# Health
Woke up feeling fine on left side all down, but achy on right side. Did Perrin technique again last night and have sometimes done part of it during the day; it seems to help fairly clearly and fairly quickly. 


# Internal check-in
Already feeling resistance to this. Not clear on why it's the problem it is, it just becomes subtly aversive. 

And then. Went on a long distracting tour into Alfred workflows, instead of working on this. I mean. Maybe its' better not to? Because it doesn't seem to help

but sometimes we're so happy and open to be in touch with ourselves

it worked! in 2020! we were able to talk to ourselves@! but then it didn't

and we never know whether to trust our own opinions. we don't know if we're right or wrong and we're always afraid to trust that if other people idsagree they really disagree and it's not just our own brain fucking us over by auto-generating the opposite of what we wanted to do. 

we're afraid of losing people. we're afraid when people go silent. we're afraid every time somethign happens, afraid because it's too important. our communication is unreliable and so we're terrified to act on it. 

we're not even sure who's here and who's not. we're afraid to check with oru past selves.
