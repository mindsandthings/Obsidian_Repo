# Day summary
I've been getting a lot mroe exercise recently, and doing ok, but still feeling pretty depressed/down/stuck/understimulated. I think indexing is contributing enormously to that, specifically this project. I don't want to give it up, because I think I can still do a very good job - but it's killing my enthusiasm. 

# Health
Frequently having to put neck back in. Worried about the frequency - it seems to be whenever I do anything, or maybe it just goes out on its own. Wish I felt comfortable asking for help. I guess tehre's the nasal adjustment people but. covid.
