# Day summary
Feeling depressed about the Green index. It just seems overwhelming, and like everything I do makes the ultimate problem worse for myself. In general, it feels like this is the wrong problem for helping me learn the skills I need to learn to be able to do the index, and what I actually need is fine-grained guidance on prioritizing kinds of information. 

Can I actually treat it as a hazing attempt, and give it the lack of respect it deserves? That would be very hard, and I'm not sure I'll be able to do it. 

Part of the problem is that it's literally presenting me with the type of problem I'm worst at without any of the support I need.
