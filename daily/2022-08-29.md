Well, hello. I have a lot of stuff to do. 

Watered all the plants heavily. Anna was disapproving that I hadn't watered them enough. It was bad I guess. I need to do that like twice a week now. 

I don't want to lose momentum on Obsidian. Or Alfred. It's essential I keep moving that forward, and stay on top of projects. 

Not sure what to do about EBT. Brain isn't being cooperative. Brain doesn't like us knowing ourselves, I think. So I'm not sure what to do. I'm reluctant to force it.
