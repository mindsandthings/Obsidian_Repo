# Day summary
still feel kinda depressed. 

# Health
Raised right shoulder in bed and it went back in and I can mostly dsit up straight comfortably now. Hard to believe I couldn't tell yesterday. Ayway, today I did my exercises without problems or reluctance. Was probably good I skipped them. 


# Internal check-in
