# Day summary
Went to Quest labs. Washing Township doc (Bodnar) had labs in MyChart but Quest did not have them so I had to phone and ask to have them faxed. Took a while. 

A friend of Izzy (Izzy is Maya's daycare-mate) has covid, and they were exposed on Friday, so we're waiting to hear back. 

Good chat today with Macrex folks. Matthew and I seem to be coming from a similar perspective. Also he has a mac. 

# Health
- New aligner today.
- Mostly pretty good. Very slightly headachy. More so after aligner. 
- Last night I was walking and turned my ankle and fell a little to the right...and it put my neck / top of skull back in. 

# Goals
Listened to Becca Syme's youtube video again on [[Intuitive Overwhelm]] which had some useful stuff in it.
