# Day summary
Internet is out. No one knows what's up with it. 

Surprisingly fast start today. 

# Health
I had thought mid-low right rib was out, and I finally pushed it and it went back in this morning. It could still be a little out, not sure, but stuff is way better than it was. 

I've restarted Muldowney and in a couple days I'll move on to Mat Level 2. idk if uppers will work well or not. 

I ordered high-dose thiamine and it should be here today. Will try just one dose (250mg) and see what happens. Goal is that it possibly helps with intracranial pressure. I hope it will do so in a sustainable way.
