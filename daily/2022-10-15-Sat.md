# Day summary
I really just want to take a nap. 

# Health
Yesterdfay played Isaac; think it got my right neck/head stuck somehow that prevented draining because it got worse and worse. Used clonazepam. Woke up feeling pretty crappy. Eventually made myself have some caffeine and about an hour later suddenly it must have drained.

Have taken some ibuprofen. Glenn and Basia's wedding tonight. Don't want to go that much but I guess I'm going anyway. Cara and Murph are coming and I still bear resentment toward her, plus I don't really want to see Michael's other friends.
