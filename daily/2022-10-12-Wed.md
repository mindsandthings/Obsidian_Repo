# Day summary
Today is the board meeting. 

# Health
Right side of head feeling a little full, but overall still feeling pretty goodâ€”and getting stuff done very fast this morning! I feel quite good. 

Today I tried only taking 200mg (at ~8am), in case the effect is cumulative. If I haven't drained/cleared out by 1, I'll take another 200. The recommended dose is 600, so even 400 is still relatively little. 

Lying down to sleep last night wasn't quite as amazingly relaxing as I'd hoped but was still pretty nice. 

Want to keep doing Perrin.
