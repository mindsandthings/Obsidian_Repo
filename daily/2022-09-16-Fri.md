It's so nice to have this work. 

Yesterday I fell off my scooter on the way to my physical exam with my gp. I felt kind of dumb and embarrassed, but am glad to know that I can fall/roll without hurting myself. It was scary though. 

I made preserved lemons last night. 

I played about an hour and a half of Isaac today. I think I should stop but also...I am bored. Class is a lot of work without being all that interesting, because it's a very long list of boring facts about names. I think I'm also anxious because I'm so behind on flashcards.
