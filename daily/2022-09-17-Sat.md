Achy from Thursday's scooter fall and a little head achy but doing well and making progress. Have been playing a lot of AC; currently working on decorating island to raise rating. 

Played a fair bit of Isaac the last couple days. Feel a little mixed about it. Enjoying though.

Today played with Maya or rather she played in sand and it was very pleasant outside. She liked the sand a lot.
