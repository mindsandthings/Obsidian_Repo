# Day summary
Hoping today will be a big meaningful catch-up day. I feel like I can trust now that my future days will be fairly similar to today, with my skull feeling back in place - and even the possibility of doing exercise more often. I especially feel like I can use my neck and arms again, so I can manipulate physical objects. 


# Health
Feeling healthy and high energy today! Neck very mildly stiff, probably from gaming all morning and then doing some Muldowney exercises. 

# Internal check-in
