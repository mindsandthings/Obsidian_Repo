Last night took dandelion leaf tea to see if it could help with inability to sleep due to head tightness. I fell asleep immediately on going to bed and woke up well-rested. 

Jen Brea is also talking about lymphatic drainage. 

Wonder if some of my lymphatic stuff got worse recently because of the vaccine. 

Depressing. Really wanted this to be over. 

Tried dry brushing today and then head apparently swelled up. Patched one eye which seems to help with pain but not sure if helping with drainage or not. Really want tohave more tea, but worried about rebound. 

Something in head on right side feels very stuck and not draining.
