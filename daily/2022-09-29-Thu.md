# Day summary


# Health
Lots of discomfort in left lower sinus. Pushing from the right on bridge of nose relieves it. 

Woke up in a lot of pain, left upper neck out. May be more or less back in. Low back did some going in too. 

Having a lot of draining slow. I'm going to try stopping antihistamines and see if that helps (in case they are reducing wetness, and clogging things). Kind of want to take a decongestant. I don't want to dry up, just thin out, though. 

# Internal check-in
Feeling wiped. Last night I felt pretty high-awful - definitely part of this physical thing I think.
