# Health
Feeling wiped and achy. Still not sure why it's so bad. Going to try continuing to raise amount that I walk, and hope it helps. 

Part of why it's bad is that I feel I'm failing at pretyt much everything. Indexing is super hard and I've done poorly, convincing me I'm not a "natural". Writing and inventing things I enjoy makes me feel under threat for unexamined assumptions, but I don't want to deconstruct everything! 

I'm fairly sure I'm in burnout, and that it's due to not having enough rewarding stuff in my life. Very hard stuff can be rewarding if it's sufficiently rewarding—I need to be good enough at it to make the effort worth it—but the problem is nothign is rewarding and there's nothing I really want to do. I don't want to overwhelm myself by adding even more mental processing stuff.
