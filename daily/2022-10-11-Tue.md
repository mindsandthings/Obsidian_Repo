# Health
Yesterday: side of back went in, and then I could see in nearly single vision again that night. Went out on a walk, felt good till abdominals started cramping - almost like having had my back in place and been able to stand up straight and see right caused it to start doing that, although it's possible that whtaever happens just before I start getting menstrual cramps is the best time for me. 

Menstrual cramps started last night and continue today. Pretty bad, too. (Could potentially be just cramping from back out, but think it's more likely back is out because of cramping). 

Took ibuprofen (4) last night and this morning. 

Also took 100mg B1 this morning (thought it was 250, but bought the cheaper ones). Taking another 3 now, for a total of 400. Hoping this will help with head swelling. Although I think my mental model is more that something is blocking everything from leaving my head (lymph and csf).
