# Day summary
Yesterday: read Nona the Ninth, sad and out of it all day due to frustration with my own writing abilities and lack of clarify on where I can or want to go. 

Today just kinda tired and low energy. 

# Health
Surprisingly hungry. I am going to have a big calorie lunch or at least try. 

Lowered famotidine by half last night and had some ouchiness and constipation early.
