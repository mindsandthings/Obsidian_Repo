Hello! Daily note in Obsidian today. 
Need to do more work planning. 

Some pain in a point in left calf. Could I have had an ocular stroke and a traveling blood clot? Sure. But I don't have enough trust in the medical system to be willing to take the hit when I go in and they don't find anything. 

I haven't been hanging out with Maya enough, partly because she doesn't seem interested in hanging out with me. I have some feelings about that.
