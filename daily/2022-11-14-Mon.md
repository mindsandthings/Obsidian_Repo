# Day summary
Worked today on Green index, outlining again. Hoping this will help me be able to pinpoint relations among the sections and not just within. Going to try re-indexing by page chunks, or possibly just making a backup copy of the index and deleting the non-name ones and starting over so I can track how many I do per page more effectively. I have somewhat too many but not massively too many. However I think (hope) the outline will help me grab the main topics better. I did not really include incidentals in the main outline though. 

# Health
Back of head clicked back into place. Went out while showering. Put it back in (I think). Started exercises again. 

Note that if I feel like a part of my back head is "touching", it's the very top bit out of place. Do not forget this. Remember to lie down and try it out, but relax first. Check in regularly.
