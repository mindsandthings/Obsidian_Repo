# Day summary
Sky Squad is pushing me very hard to ban/ask NFS to leave based on unspecified bad thigns done in past relationships involving failure to take system responsibility. 

They have argued:
1) that because NFS is in other servers, there will be minimal harm done to them
2) 

I guess I am thinking:
1) what are the consequences of sticking to my guns. does it even matter? I'd rather they not be in the server, but the rules exist for a reason
2) should I demod Sky Squad? I currently don't trust their judgment. 
3) is there any way to deescalate things with Sky Squad? They're not showing any sign of responsiveness to my talking about the rest of the server. 
4) I'm worried things jsut get worse from here. 
5) Sky Squad views it as a friend group server because they're part of the group. 

Do I think we should have a rule allowing members to be banned for actions done to third parties? Should it require proof? What actions are bad enough to ban someone for? Does it matter whether they are likely to do those same things within the server? 

Do I think we should have a rule allowing members to be banned when another server member says they're extremely uncomfortable with another member? 

tbh this makes me feel like total crap. 



# Health
New glasses good, though after I'd been at my desk for a while I started feeling ill. May have been from tilting the right side up for clearer right-eye vision though. Have returned it to flat.
