oof I woke up incredibly dizzy whenever I turn my head. congested maybe? I don't think I hit it. We have had eh air quality (50s-70s)

Yesterday felt way better after working on indexing stuff. Today I'll work on it some more but also I hope keep momentum on other things. 

Goign to do BPPV first though.
