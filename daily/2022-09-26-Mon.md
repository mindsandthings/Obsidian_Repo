# Day summary
Forgot meds in morning again. How to fix that? Set second alarm? Always do first before turning alarms off? 

# Health
Noticed small hole in base of left toenail with black stuff inside. Black stuff is not amenable to coming out. Called doctor (teladoc); young guy said not to worry about it unless it shows signs of infection. He did mention that toenails can be damaged at the base by pressure at the tip, and I realized my toenail was quite long, so I trimmed it a lot. There was a bunch of dark and light crumbly icky stuff underneath that could be just dirt. 

I was kind of hoping it could be an infection that accounted for my lymph node drainage stuff - I think I might have too much lymph fluid? Especially in my upper throat. Oh well. Maybe Dr. Bodnar will message me at some point about the low neutrophils, or maybe not. 

Mammogram tomorrow.
