# Day summary
Eric is throwing up. ): I am avoiding the outside of the room. I feel bad for him. I do not want to help and puke myself. 

Went to ASI-PNW indexing conf. Was unimpressed. Seems like people arguing about details in practice without knowledge of existing discourse around it. 

# Health
Felt good until sat on couch and then head swelled up. Perrin stuff has been really helping, but it feels like if somethign happens, it backlogs again.
