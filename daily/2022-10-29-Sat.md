# Day summary
I've been low energy and depressed. Possibly from feeling not great this last week; possibly from my body catching up and going sluggish from not going on walks while my feet recover. 

I feel pretty emotionally broken from the fallout of everything—Clarion West, PubQ, my writer's group, Ana—made mroe intense by people in Timezone wanting others banned for their personal comfort. Blatantly wanting, in fact, and asking for in a very naive autistic way, where they didn't even try to justify it as for the good of the server. I am relieved the server sided with me, but otherwise not happy. 

Because it's just. So much. 

I have been reading a lot of tumblr in the mornings because I"m not getting up. 

# Health
Last night I had an extra 10mg famotidine along with ibuprofen, in hopes it helpe,d and I made sure to do a Perrin. I feel a little better today, but definitely not high-energy or great. 

I also lowered my thaimin because I was running low, so I'll try a total of 800mg today. 

Bolting a glass of water seemed to improve things immediately.
