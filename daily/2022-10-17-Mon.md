# Day summary
Got period last night finally. Slept well, felt very good in dreams. 

# Health
Left metatarsal(?) hurts badly when I stand on it. Maybe was from shoes at wedding, which were comfortable but did change how I stood. 

Now I am in pain. I will try wearing my other walking shoes indoors.
