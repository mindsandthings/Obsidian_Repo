# Day summary
Indexing book club. Am acting young and pleading/suckup/dumb. Need to stop doing that. Having trouble doing it in the format of the club, where I don't know how to break in and people aren't asked their thoughts individually. I don't know the culture either. I have to say something, but I would like to have said less. 

Maybe the workbook exercises will help. 

# Health
Couldn't sleep for many hours last night. I actually suspect I was waking up over and over, instead; it felt like about 2 hours had passed but it had been 4. Head just felt overwhelmingly like swelling up over and over, sometimes in ways that felt genuinely scary. Need to do Perrin technique before bed every time I think. 

Also, staying up past melatonin window was bad and I need to not do that anymore. 

May be also mid cycle problems and/or lowering famotidine. 

Very tired, and head feels tight and explodey. Wondering if I'm having an alelrgic reactio to the pizza I had last night maybe. Or a salt issue. 

Last night right side of upper neck/base of skull felt horribly cramped and it finally went pop, causing left lower sinus to instantly feel blocked. Now it still feels wrong but also swollen. Maybe I damged it. 

I am incredibly sleepy and otu of it and I put some voltarn gel on my neck lymph nodes and am going to have a cup of tea after hydrating with water. 

SUdeenly it feels like it is draining, I just tilted my head altitle
