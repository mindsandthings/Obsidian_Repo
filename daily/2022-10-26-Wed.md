# Day summary
See Nightfall System discord thing with Sky. ugh ugh ugh. I need to reply today and I don't really want to. But I also feel super mentally / life-wise stuck, unable to move forward on anything but writing. Stuck on the index even. Maybe I should just start the index over. 

# Health
Low back left panel: pushed on it and it went in and fixed the thing where things felt rotated around to the right. I do feel kind of dull and achy at the back of my head now though, and I've been sitting in one place zoning out for hours. 

# Internal check-in
