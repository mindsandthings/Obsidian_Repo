## 3.3 Asking the Information Questions

![five questions: who what where why when](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565859/preview)

The answers to the information questions can be used to reveal the meaning derived from the text. These answers can then be delineated as the _metatopics._ Metatopics are literally the "main topics" of the text. There will be a main metatopic of the book, chapter metatopics, or even metatopics of different sections of the text. Let us use a book about the U.S. patent system as an example. The metatopic of the book is obviously the "U.S. patent system." This main metatopic would be a general main heading. And, as per the discussion in [Topic 2.3](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/pages/2-dot-3-when-to-use-general-main-headings "2.3 When To Use General Main Headings"), the indexer must use discretion when indexing a general main heading or the main metatopic of the book. Other important metatopics for this book might include:

-   Patent applications
-   Patent litigation
-   CAFC (Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit)
-   Innovation process
-   Intellectual property
-   Technology

The above list of metatopics will become some of the main headings of the index, but not all main headings listed in an index are necessarily metatopics. For example, individuals listed in a text, unless they are in a biographical context or play an otherwise pivotal role in the discussion, are seldom metatopics but are typically listed as main headings. Do Mi Stauber, in her _Facing the Text,_ has a more complete discussion of metatopics and good term selection.

My experience has been that the main headings are most often derived from the "who," "what," and "where" questions. Sometimes, depending on the material, "when" questions can also result in main headings. For example, historical time periods can often be viable main headings. "Why" and "under what circumstances" answers often provide the pertinent subtopic information. The "who" and "what" information, in addition to being used for main headings, can also provide subentries that clarify the main headings. For example, the "what" main heading may be followed by a "who" subentry. Conversely, the "who" main heading may be followed by a "what" subentry.

During the indexing process, it is important to differentiate between main headings and subheadings. According to Mulvany, main headings are _primary access points_ for readers. In other words, the main headings are where the reader will be looking for the fundamental units of information. Subheadings present related aspects of the main headings broken down for easier access by the reader.

It's been my observation that learning the difference between main and subheadings can be difficult for new indexers. It helps to consider the audience; an important aspect of selecting main headings is to anticipate what entry the reader might look up to locate specific information. And subheadings should be selected to help the reader break down that information into units not likely to be otherwise accessed. It must be pointed out here that many main headings are also proper subheadings under other related main headings.

As we proceed with our application exercise in the next topic, you will see that even though all of the information questions must be asked, there won't always be answers to all of them. Terms are selected only from the information revealed through the answered questions.
