**What did you find difficult or challenging?**

1. Deciding on a format for subheadings. I ultimately went with noun followed by verb for places and themes ("palace gate, soldier stationed at") and the reverse for characters ("queen, greets teddy bear"). With characters, I feel this risks making subentries harder to find, because indexes can standardize nouns via cross-references, but not verbs (I can't do "welcomes. See greets"). I initially did a draft that was also noun-first for characters ("queen, teddy bear, greeted by") but felt it impacted readability severely enough to warrant doing it the other way around. I still feel conflicted about it, though.

2. Making subheadings consistent with each other and the heading without weird circumlocutions.  

3. Figuring out themes. I did an entry for "loneliness of the queen", but there was a theme of formality/ceremony that I wanted to capture and gave up on because I couldn't get it into words. 

  
**What part of the indexing process did you find to be easy?**

I was surprised how easy it was to determine relations using the who/when/what/why/where/under what circumstances questions. 

**Are you happy with your results? If not, what would you like to improve?**

I'd like to get better at capturing themes. 

**Is there anything about Exercise 2 that you'd like to comment on?**

It got easier conceptually when I realized that from a fiction-writing standpoint I was indexing the relationships among characters, plot, and setting.

#### Further comments

realizing subentries are about the relationship between two things in the context of the main header. wondering how to handle three things. thinking about when two things are really one thing. 

#### Muffet: 
- "frightening of Little Miss Muffet" both a name used to describe the whole event, and a specific part of the event
- thinking about what matters: do the curds and whey and the tuffet matter? they're a setting, but they're not relevant to the main action. BUT these are things that modern readers will remember, because they're unusual. 
- thinking about what constitutes separate events: spider comes along, spider sits down - or is that one event? 
- thinking about completed vs uncompleted actions - eaten by vs eating by

#### Teddy bear: 
- how to index framing story
- nouning verbs. "wall sitting by" feels forced. tradeoffs between term-first and making things easy to read. 
- wondering about contents: visit to the queen is inclusive but then things happen in it
- wondering whether an unnamed speaker gets an entry 

#### Baa baa black sheep: 
- how to consider sheep's statements about master/dame/little boy as separate chapters
- wondering whether an unnamed speaker gets an entry
