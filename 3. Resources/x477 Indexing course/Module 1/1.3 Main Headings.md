## 1.3 Main Headings

In order to discuss the basic aspects of indexing, it is first necessary to define some of the terminology associated with indexes, beginning with the basic parts of an index structure. In this and the next five topics, I'll cover the fundamental indexing terminology you'll need to know.

==An index is structured as a hierarchy, and a main heading is the top line of the hierarchy. Sometimes referred to as a _main entry_ or _subject heading_, a main heading is a primary access point of an index.

main heading  
   subheading, 8, 37, 64  
   subheading, 5, 26, 59

==**Main headings are always nouns, noun phrases, or gerunds (a verbal that ends in -_ing_ and functions as a noun).** They include names, organization names, titles, and important conceptual topics of the text.== Names that are main headings have an inverted format:

Doe, John

We will talk more about indexing names in Module 4.
