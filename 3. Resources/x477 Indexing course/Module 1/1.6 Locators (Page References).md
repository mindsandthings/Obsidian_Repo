## 1.6 Locators (Page References)

Reference locators direct the reader to where the information listed in an index entry can be located in the text. Reference locators are usually Arabic numbers but may be letters, a combination of letters or words and Arabic numbers, section numbers, or volume numbers. Some publishers have recently started to use paragraph ID numbers as locators. ==The advantage of using paragraph ID numbers is that the locators remain stable during page reflow. This provides the same advantages of an embedded index which also remains stable during page reflow.== We’ll be expanding the discussion of paragraph ID numbers in the Module 9 discussions on embedded indexes.

For example:

**Arabic Page References**

main heading  
   subentry, 33, 41

**Section Numbers**

main heading  
   subentry, 1-33, 5-41

**Letter Page References**

main heading  
   subentry, A, D

**Volume Numbers**  
(Volumes 1 and 8 in this example)

main heading  
   subentry, 1:33, 8:41

**Arabic Numbers/Letters**

main heading  
   subentry, A-33, D-41  

**Arabic Paragraph ID Numbers**  
(Caption B with paragraph ID in this example)

main heading  
   subheading, B1.P88-B1.P92  

### Format of Arabic Page References

Different presses have different format requirements for Arabic page references (the most common locator type and referred to from here on out as _page reference_). These are the possible page reference formats that an editor may request. Notice the subtle differences between the formats.

==**Unsquashed page references (often referred to as all-inclusive numbers):**

56, 100-103, 106-108, 110-143, 156, 189-193, 1496-1504

==**Hart's Rules page references:**

56, 100-3, 106-8, 110-43, 156, 189-93, 1496-504

==**Chicago 17th-style page references:**

56, 100-103, 106-8, 110-43, 156, 189-93, 1496-1504

Indexing software has these page reference formats as a built-in feature. So if you use unsquashed page references while writing the index, the required page reference format can be selected and automatically inserted during the final editing process.

Hart’s rule (commonly referred to by presses as Oxford style) is the most common locator format used in Australia.

As in the U.S., a variety of locator formats is used in Canada, depending on the requirements of the individual publisher.

### Roman Numeral Page References

The Roman numeral page references that are often found in the front matter of a book are not considered indexable material and are not typically included in the index. However, if an editor asks that Roman numeral page references be included, they are listed in front of Arabic page references when found in the same entry. And Roman numerals are always given in full (i.e. xxv-xxviii). For example:

main heading  
   subheading, xxv-xxviii, 33, 41

### Page References for Display Material

Page references may also be used to designate the location of display material (tables, illustrations, photographs, maps, figures). The following formats are typical for display material:

**Endnotes.** _See_ **Footnotes**

Figures: 133 fig. 7 or 133(figure) or 133*fig* or 133*f*

**Footnotes (and endnotes):**

without individual note numbers: 133n

with individual note numbers: 133n.2

two or more footnotes on same page: 133nn.2, 5

**Illustrations:** 133*i*

**Maps:** 133*m*

**Photographs:** 133*p*

**Tables:** 

133*t* or  
133 table 5

Individual presses may have instructions regarding the footnote "n" being in italics and the use of a period or no period following the "n". There may also be differences in the use of italics for any of the above designations. And there are some presses that prefer no special designation of display treatment at all.

Chicago 17th Section 16.116 also states that references to illustrations may be set in italics or boldface. And that tables can be indicated as: 133 table 5 (the number of the table) and figures indicated as: 133 fig. 7 (the number of the figure). However, many publishers prefer to use shorten versions of: 133t and 133fig, or 133f, with no indication of number of either table or figure. When working for a new client, you must ask for the press indexing specifications in order to follow your client's usual practice.

Individual presses may also have different instructions on how to treat page references to text information and display material on the same page. Following are two examples of situations:

1.  When there is a subheading with page references to the text, and display material also relates to the subheading topic:
    
    main heading  
       subheading, 54, 133, 133*fig* 
	1. Some publishers prefer to use this approach:
	    
	    main heading  
	       subheading, 54, 133fig
	    
2.  When there is a page range of the subheading topic but inside the page range there is a figure relating to the same topic:
    
    main heading  
       subheading, 130-135, 133*fig*
    

When in doubt, consult with the editor regarding the press format requirements on display material.

### When to Use Page Ranges

One last issue affecting page reference format is continuing versus noncontinuous discussion of a topic in the text. If the discussion of an indexable topic begins on one page and continues over to the next page or next several pages, the formatting would be, for example:

main heading  
   subheading, 130-132

However, if the discussion of this topic is intermittently mentioned on these pages and not a continuous discussion, the page reference format may look like this:

main heading  
   subheading, 130, 131, 132
