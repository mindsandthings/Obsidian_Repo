Hello! I'm Elizabeth, and I live in the San Francisco Bay Area. I'm taking the UC Berkeley course in indexing, and I hope to go into freelance indexing or possibly do related information classification work like taxonomy development. I have master's degrees in information science and in research psychology from University of Michigan, and I used to work as a data manager and project manager on behavioral health studies at UCSF. I also write fiction and nonfiction, and have some editing experience.  
  
Looking forward to learning more (and maybe meeting some other indexers at some point)!  
  
Elizabeth
