Hello! I'm Elizabeth, and I live in the San Francisco Bay Area. I used to be a data manager and project manager, and have a background in user experience design and in research psychology. For the last seven years, I've been writing fiction and nonfiction. I've also done editing and critiquing.Â 

I'm hoping to go into freelance indexing, or possibly related information classification work like taxonomy development.

I took the first module in ASI's four-module indexing course and enjoyed it a lot. After reading a post on the IDG list about this course's weekly chats for students and alumni, I decided to switch and do this course instead.
