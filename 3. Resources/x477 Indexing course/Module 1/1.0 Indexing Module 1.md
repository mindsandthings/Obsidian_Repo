## Module 1: Introduction to Indexing

With advances of computer technology, and with the publishing industry's norm of freelancers working from home, indexing has become a viable career choice for many.

In this module, we will critically examine the realities of an indexing career. Then I'll introduce you to the basic terminology you'll need to take part in this course and begin your exploration of the practice of indexing.

### Discussion

- [x] Discussion participation is worth 15 percent of your final grade. In this module, we'll warm up with class introductions.

If you want to post on topics that aren't necessarily about this module's work, please feel free to use the [Questions and Answers Discussion Forum](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/discussion_topics/10736094 "Questions and Answers Discussion Forum"). If you have questions for me that you don't want to share with the class, click on Inbox in your top navigation bar to access Canvas's internal mail system.

##### **Indexing Live Chat**

Remember to check the Indexing weekly chat if you have specific questions of the instructors. You'll find more information about the chat in our course syllabus.

### Assignments

##### **Module 1 Research Activity**

- [x] 1.  #task Go to [The American Society for IndexingLinks to an external site.](http://www.asindexing.org/) (ASI) website and familiarize yourself with the information there. Check the site for information on the ASI chapters and identify the chapter closest to where you are. Nonmembers are welcome to attend ASI chapter meetings, which provide excellent opportunities to network with experienced indexers. Chapter meeting announcements are made on the Index-L discussion group, described below. 
      

- [x] 2.  Now take a look at the websites of the following indexing associations outside of the United States. #task ✅ 2022-08-31
    -   [Society of IndexersLinks to an external site.](http://www.indexers.org.uk/) -- The British and Irish professional body of indexing
    -   [Indexing Society of Canada/Société canadienne d'indexationLinks to an external site.](http://www.indexers.ca/) is specifically for students and new indexers interested in the Canadian ISC/SCI.
    -   [Australian and New Zealand Society of Indexers (ANZSI)Links to an external site.](http://www.anzsi.org/)  
          
        

##### **Join the Lists: Student Introduction**

Numerous online discussion groups are either devoted to the topic of indexing or topics related to indexing. These online discussion groups may be of particular interest to students: the Indexers' Discussion Group and Scholarly Indexing.

1.  **Indexer’s Discussion Group (IDG)** is similar to Index-L with some important differences. The differences are that the posting rules are more relaxed (allowing for more off-topic discussion), and it tends to be a particularly friendly and less formal group.  
      
    - [x] #task Join the [Indexer's Discussion GroupLinks to an external site.](https://groups.io/g/idg) by sending email to [idg+subscribe@groups.io](mailto:idg+subscribe@groups.io).  **_Required:_** Post an introduction of yourself on this list. It would be appropriate to mention your current student status, your geographical location, and perhaps what your expectations or aspirations are regarding an indexing career. You may include any other information you deem to be appropriate. ✅ 2022-09-01
    
    Please note that these lists have strict rules regarding the discussion of politics, religion, and personal values or beliefs, unless they are germane to the discussion of indexing. When appropriate, there may be posting of off topics. When posting off topics, the subject heading should be prefixed with an "OT:" to alert other Index-L members that an off-topic message is being posted. Appropriate off-topic messages, for example, are postings about subjects related to indexing, such as operating or purchasing computers and printers. One last issue: it is considered courtesy to send plain text messages rather than HTML-formatted ones to Index-L. So please change your settings to send out only e-mails of plain text.
    
    In Australia the online discussion group is aliaINDEXERS (run by ALIA, the Australian Library and Information Association). It doesn’t get much use and mainly provides notification of events. ANZSI is considering setting up its own alternative discussion list, which is more focused.
    
    Australian indexers generally tend to be very conservative and do not belong to or join in on discussion lists, which probably explains the apathy toward aliaINDEXERS. I am not saying don’t join the list, but, if you do, you are unlikely to get much of a response. Australian indexers are very social, and network through very regular face-to-face meetings organized by the Branches of ANZSI.
    
- [x] #task 2.  **Scholarlyindexing discussion group**. To subscribe to this worthwhile list send an email message to scholarlyindexing+subscribe@groups.io or visit [https://groups.io/g/scholarlyindexingLinks to an external site.](https://groups.io/g/scholarlyindexing) to subscribe online. ✅ 2022-08-31

All of these online discussion groups include experienced indexers, newbies (brand new indexers), editors, and individuals who are interested in the field of indexing.

- [x] #task Confirm that my email posted to the list ✅ 2022-09-01
