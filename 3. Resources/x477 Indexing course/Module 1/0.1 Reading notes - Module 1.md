==Make sure to also review the commentary, since some of it is different or less stringent than Chicago style. 

# Module 1
## Mulvany 16-­‐20 Chapter 1: “Ideal Index” to end of chapter  
- Bring together references to similar concepts scattered in the text or in varying terminology
- If a category of material isn't indexed, state it in the introductory note
- Appropriate, precise, accurate, and unambiguous headings, consistent in form and usage
- Represent the text, not the indexer's views and interests
- Arrange in a recognizable or stated searchable order
- Enough cross-references to connect related items and relate obsolete/idiosyncratic terms to terms in current use
- Explain abbreviations, acronyms, symbols, etc appropriately
* Terminology
	- Main heading
	- Subheadings
	- Reference locators (locators)
	- Cross-reference: internal index navigation guides, usually see or see also
	- Entry: a main heading with the entire block of information that follows it (including subheadings)

## Mulvany 63-­‐67 Chapter 3: “Interpreting the Publisher’s Instructions” (you may stop at “Usability and Index Style”)  
* Index should conform to house style, be of desired length, and be delivered on time.
* Style guides have typically emerged from years of experience with a particular type of book. Many publishers know not all books will fit that mode, and may accommodate the indexer, but such changes should not be made lightly; the indexer will have to present a strong and persuasive argument, and will likely be dealing with an editor who knows little about indexing or the reasons for the house style. 
* The five basic elements of index style are
	* Alphabetizing of main entries: usually letter-by-letter or word-by-word. 
	* Arrangement of subheadings: usually alphabetic, but some want chronologically, obtained by sorting the subheadings in ascending locator order. 
	* Format of entries: usually either indented or run-in; many variations on each. 
	* Format of reference locators: eg eliding repeated digits. 
	* Format and placement of cross-references: variations especially in the *See also* references (capitalized vs lowercased, at the beginning of an entry or at the end, etc). 
* Most style guides will include more instructions than the above, e.g. whether main headings should always be capitalized, how to cite notes and illustrations, and whether run-in subheadings start on a separate line or the main line.

The University of Chicago Press Editorial Staff. Indexes. University of Chicago Press. Kindle Edition. 
### Intro material (16.1-16.8)
* gathers substantive terms and subjects of the work, sorts them alphabetically, provides cross-references to and from related terms, and includes specific page numbers or other locators or, for electronic formats, direct links to the text
* most book indexes have to be made between the time page proofs are issued and the time they are returned to the typesetter, usually about 4 weeks
* a single index is recommended for most works. some publications that cite numerous authors include both a subject index and an index of named authors. An anthology may have an author-and-title index, and a collection of poetry or hymns may have first line and title. Good to have be visually distinct to prevent confusion. 
* embedded indexes: key terms anchored with codes to underlying points in the text to facilitate search. a search for those words pulls up the correct point in the text. 
* 16.8 Resources for indexers. For greatly expanded coverage of the present  guidelines, along with alternative methods, consult the second edition of  Nancy Mulvany’s Indexing Books (bibliog. 2.5). Anyone likely to prepare  a number of indexes should acquire that work. For further reference, see  Hans H. Wellisch, Indexing from A to Z, and Linda K. Fetters, Handbook  of Indexing Techniques (bibliog. 2.5). 
* the ideal indexer sees the work as a whole, understands the emphasis of the various parts and their relation to the whole, and knows or guesses what readers will look for what what headings they will think of


### Components of an index (16.8-)
* #### Main headings, subentries, and locators
* ##### Main heading: 
	* normally a noun or noun phrase (person, place object, abstraction). 
	* an adjective alone should almost never constitute a heading but should be paired with a noun to form a noun phrase, sometimes inverted to allow the keyword to appear first
	* typically followed by page/para numbers and sometimes a cross-ref
* ##### Index subentries
	* One that requires more than 5-6 locators is usually broken up into subentries. 
	* A subentry consists of a heading (usually referred to as a subheading), page refs, and rarely, cross-references
	* Subentries often form a grammatical relationship with the main heading, whereby the combine into a single phrase
	* Other subheadings form divisions or units within the larger category of the heading. 
	* Both kinds of subheadings may be used within the same index. 
* ##### Initial lowercase letters in main headings and subheadings
	* First word of a main heading normally capitalized only if capitalized in text
	* Indexes in the sciences should avoid initial capitals since the distinction may be crucial
	* subheadings are always lowercased unless capitalized in text
* ##### Locators in indexes
	* Usually page numbers but can be paragraph, section, etc
	* Give inclusive numbers when discussion continues for more than a page
* ##### Linked indexes for e-books and other electronic formats
	* At a minimum, should be linked to the text, as reflowable text can result in the actual place being beyond the first "page"
	* A detailed specification for indexes using EPUB is available from the International Digital Publishing Forum
* ##### Inclusive numbers in indexes
	* Chicago prefers: 
		* If first number is <100, use all digits: 3-10, 96-117
		* If first number is 100 or multiple of 100, use all digits
		* If first number is 101-109, 201-209, etc., use the changed part only: 101-8, 1103-4
		* If first number is 110-199, 210-299, etc: use two digits unless more are needed to include all changed parts. 321-28, 12991-3001, 1087-89
		* Roman numbers are always given in full. 
* #### Cross-references
	* *See* and *see also* are set in italics. In epubs, should link to the terms to which they refer. Use with discretion; too many may annoy reader and signal need to consolidate entries. 
	* ##### "See" references and double posting
		* Direct a reader from an informal term to a technical one, a pseud to a real name, an inverted term to a noninverted one. Also variant spellings, synonyms, aliases, abbreviates, ettc.
		* The full entry should appear under the term where the reader is most likely to look. Give *see* references only when many readers might otherwise miss the full entry. Ensure there are no circular cross-references. If the two entries are about the same, double posting is more helpful. 
	* ##### "See" references following a main heading
		* Precede by a period and *See* is capitalized.
		* If two or more *see* references are needed, arrange in alphabetical order and separate by semicolons. *See* teenagers; youth
	* ##### "See" references following a subheading
		* Put in parentheses and lowercase (*see* supplements, online)
		* For both run-in and indented indexes and sub-subentries.
	* ##### "See" references to a subheading
		* Most *see* references are to a main entry. When it directs to a subentry under another main heading, *see under* may be used
		* Alternative: drop "under" and add the wording of the subheading, following a colon. *See* Austen, Jane: *Pride and Prejudice*
	* ##### "See also" references
		* Placed at the end of the entry when *additional* information can be found in another entry
		* In run-in, follow a period; in indented, appear on a separate line
		* *See* is capitalized and both words are in italics
		* If it's to a subentry under another main heading, *see also under* may be used. 
		* If two or more *see also* references are needed, they are arranged in alphabetical orer and separated by semicolons
		* Must never lead to a *see* reference
		* If it doesn't work in a context (one of the see also refs is to a main entry and another to a subentry), drop the word *under* and add the wording of the subentry after a colon: *See also* Mexican art; Yucatan: Maya
		* When it comes at the end of a subentry, put it in parents and lowercase see: in democracy's definition, 24 (*see also* democracy); League of the Rights of Man debate on, 234-235
	* ##### Correspondence between cross-references and headings
		* Generally cited in full, with capitalization, inversion, and punctuation exactly as in the heading referred to. May occasionally be shortened if no confusion results.
	* ##### Italics for "see," "see also," and so forth
		* The words are normally italicized, but if what follows is italicized (a word in another language, a title), see/see also are preferably not italicized. However they are *not* italicized if they follow italics. 
	* ##### Generic cross-references
		* Refer to a type of heading rather than to several specific headings. 
		* Entire thing is set in italics: 
			* *See names of individual buildings*
			* *See also specific titles*
		* When generic cross-references accompany specific cross-references, the generic cross-references are placed last, even if out of alphabetical order, using *and* following a semicolon:
		* "*See also* American Kennel Club; shelters; *and individual breed*"
* #### Run-in versus indented indexes
	* ##### Flush-and-hang formatting for indexes
		* For first lines. When there are subentries, a choice must be made between run-in and indented. In print and similar electronic works, indexes usually use multiple columns; don't do that in manuscripts
	* ##### Run-in style for indexes
		* Subentries follow main entry and one another with out a new line, separated by semicolons. Main headings immediately followed by subentries are separated by a colon. Locators are preceded by a comma and (if more entries) followed by a semicolon
		* Chicago and many other publishers generally prefer run-in style because it requires less space
	* ##### Indented style for indexes:
		* AKA stacked style
		* Each subentry begins a new line and is indented usually 1em
		* No colon before first subheading, no semicolons; runover lines are usually indented 2em instead of 1 to make it clear they're not entries
		* *See also* belonging to the overall entry appear at the end of the subentries; ones belong to a specific subentry go in parens at the end of the subentry
	* ##### Sub-subentries in run-in indexes
		* If more than a handful are needed, the indented format rather than the run-in type should be chosen
		* But a very few can be accommodated in a run-in index or avoided by repeating a keyword
		* Or sub-entries can be put on a new line and then sub-subentries each on a new line preceded by an em dash flush with a margin
		* armor and weapons
		* —attack weapons (general): Early Helladic and Cycladic, 33; Mycenaean, 225, 255
	* ##### Sub-subentries in indented indexes
		* Best run in (style A). If that makes them hard to use, put them each on a new line and indent them more deeply than the subentries (style B). In the second case, runover lines have to be indented 3 ems, which may result in very short lines
		* If sub-sub-subentries are required, style B must be used, and they must be run in. 


### Subentries (16.68-70)
#### Alphabetical order of subentries
**Introductory articles, prepositions,  and conjunctions are disregarded** in alphabetizing subentries (but see 16.53), whether the subentries are run in or indented. To preserve the  alphabetic logic of the keywords, avoid substantive introductory words  at the beginnings of subheadings (e.g., “relations with,” “views on”). 
Churchill, Winston: as anti-Fascist, 369; on Curzon line, 348, 349; and de Gaulle, 544n4
#### Numerical order of subentries
Occasional subentries demand numerical order even if others in the same index (but not the same entry) are  alphabetized.  

Daley, Richard J. (mayor): third term,  205; fourth term, 206– 7  

flora, alpine: at 1,000- meter level,  46, 130– 35; at 1,500- meter level,  146– 54; at 2,000- meter level, 49,  164– 74 

#### Chronological order of subentries
May be arranged chronologically to provide a quick summary of the subject's career and avoid "death of" near start; use with caution and only when logic is obvious. 

### What parts of the work to index(16.109-16.113)
#### Indexing the text, front matter, and back matter
Index the entire text including substantive content in notes. Much of the front matter is not indexable (title page, dedication, lists, acknowledgments). A preface may be indexed if it concerns the subject of the work and not just how it came to be written. Substantive matter in an introduction whether in the front matter or the body is always indexed. Appendixes should be indexed if they contain info supplementing the text, but not just reproducing documents discussed in the text. Appendixes to journal articles are indexed as parts of the articles. Glossaries, bibliogrpahies, and other such lists are usually not indexed.  
#### Indexing footnotes and endnotes
Only if they continue or amplify discussion in the text. Don't index notes that merely contain source citations documentating statements in the text. 
#### Endnote locators in index entries
Referred to by page, the letter n for note, and the note number, with no internal space: 334n14. If consecutive notes, use an en dash: 334nn13-16. If they're from more than one chapter but on the same page, include the chapter number in parens, especially if the notes share the same number: birds, 334n2 (chap. 8), 334n2 (chap. 9). 
#### Footnote locators in index entries
Generally referred to the same way as end notes. If there's only one footnote on the page, you can omit the page number: 156n. 
If there's indexable material in a text passage and a related fotonote, only the page number need be given. But if the text and footnote materials aren't connected, cite both the text and note. 
#### Indexing notes spanning more than one printed page
Normally only the first page number is given but if the reference is to a part of a note that appears on the second page, use the second page number. Referring to a successio of notes may require inclusive page numbers (234-35nn19-23).

### Indexing illustrations, tables, charts, and such (16.116)
May be indexed if of particular importance to the discussion especially when such items are not listed in or after the table of contents. Refs to illustrations may be set in italics (or boldface if preferred); a head note should be inserted at the beginning of the index. 
Alternately, refs to tables may be denoted by t, figures by f, plates by pl, or whatever works (all in roman with no space following the page number: 209t)

# Indexing Books MOOC
 A letter-by-letter sort begins with the first word in the entry and continues until either a comma or parenthesis has been reached. Spaces and all other punctuation marks, including hyphens are ignored. 

A word-by-word sort starts with the first word in the entry and stops at the end of the word. The sorting begins again with the next word of the entry.

One last issue related to sorting an index is that certain words, called function words, are to be ignored in the sort. These words are: A, An, and The. This is the case for main headings as well as for subheadings. So, for example, this title would be sorted under under the "Os" and not under "Ts." The author, Ernest Hemingway, is indicated by the parenthetical last name of the author.

In addition, prepositions and conjunctions are ignored in the sort in subheadings.

Those of you who have used computer manual indexes will be familiar with the practice of listing entries that begin with numbers and symbols at the top of the index ahead of the "A" entries. In traditional publishing the practice is different and is to sort the numbers as they are said out loud. This entry, the well-known address of the White House, would be sorted under "S" just as it is said out loud: "sixteen."

## Index specifications list
Please note that this list is not exhaustive but does cover the primary specifications that must be spelled out before beginning to write the index:

-   Main heading capitalized or only proper noun main heading
-   Index format to be indented or run-on format
-   What page reference format to follow
-   Whether to capitalize the cross-references or not
-   What alphabetic sorting to use: word-by-word or letter-by-letter
-   Whether to include alphabet headings between the alphabetic groups or an extra space
One last, but crucially important issue that needs to be provided to the indexer is how many pages are available for the index.

## Types of indexes
All of the above index types have conventions specific to them. For example, Scripture indexes are not sorted alphabetically at all but by book order as they appear in, for example, the Bible. So a scripture index would begin with citations from Genesis and end with citations from the Book of Revelation. There are similar specific rules applied to all of the above index types and which a professional indexer is expected to be able to apply correctly.

The type of text and publisher is also an important fact in term selection. There many different types of publications:

-   Trade book
-   Scholarly books published by university presses
-   Scholarly books published by non-university presses
-   Textbooks
-   Journals
-   Travel books
-   Fiction (these books are seldom indexed but there have been exceptions)
-   Biographies; letter collections; diares
-   Technical documentation
-   Corporate publications

The books listed above can have some very specialized indexing specifications.

## Thematic approach
A thematic approach to the polar bear topic requires that we examine that topic in the _context of the author’s discourse._ For example, let us suppose that the author is writing about the polar bear as an indicator species. Using a thematic mindset to index such a book, the indexer would be looking for concepts like the ecosystem, pollution, climate change, and disease which all contribute to the theme, or discourse, of the polar bear being an indicator specific. Now it is possible that not all anticipated topics will actually be found in the text. But by mentally anticipating those topics, the indexer will be looking for those and all related topics in the text and will be in a position to pick them up for the index. All of the identified concepts will then become main heading topics in the index and accurately represent the author’s message or theme in the index. Attempting to use a classification approach to selecting appropriate main heading topics is not likely to result in an index that accurately represented the author’s message in such a book.

There are a relatively small percentage of people whose first instinct is to think thematically and there has been some interesting research conducted as explained in the the article [Thematic Relations n Adults' Concept](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/2714087/files/133417077/download "Lin-Murphy_01_thematic_relations.pdf")   [![]( Download Thematic Relations n Adults' Concept](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/2714087/files/133417077/download?download_frd=1)  by Lin and Murphy explains more about thematic thinking. I believe those few “natural indexers.” They are the rare individuals who have an innate talent for writing indexes while almost everyone else initially struggles with the indexing process.

## Embedded indexing
Lucie Haskins has written a wonderful explanation of how to use either DEXembed or WordEmbed with a stand-alone indexing software program to write an embedded index for a Word document [DiggingInForLongHaul.pdf](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/2714087/files/133417070/download "DiggingInForLongHaul.pdf")  [![]( Download DiggingInForLongHaul.pdf](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/2714087/files/133417070/download?download_frd=1) . 

Lucie has also written an informative summary on working with embedded indexing. I invite you to read it here [Jumping on the embedded indexing bandwagon.pdf](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/2714087/files/133417072/download "Jumping on the embedded indexing bandwagon.pdf")  [![](https://canvas.instructure.com/images/svg-icons/svg_icon_download.svg) Download Jumping on the embedded indexing bandwagon.pdf](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/2714087/files/133417072/download?download_frd=1) .

The new kid (software) on the block is Index-Manager, which is an embedded indexing utility that works with Word files, XML files, and InDesign IDML files.  Index-Manager has a lot of capabilities beyond embedding, such as being able to show word frequencies and shows an enormous potential for indexers interested in embedded indexing. A particularly interesting feature is the ability to index in Cindex, Macrex, and SKY and then import the index file into Index-Manager to complete the embedded indexing process.

## Book production team
When a book is accepted for publication by a press it goes through many stages of development before it reaches the indexer. The book production team, headed by the production editor, is made up of many individuals all performing different production tasks. Typically these include, but are not limited to, the designer, copy editor, photo researcher, compositor (or “comp”), proofer, and indexer. The production editor’s job is to oversee the production process. They are also the individual who will be hiring the indexer. The production editor will normally be the one to send the book .pdf to the indexer to begin writing the index. The indexer is typically working on the index at the same time as the author and proofer will be going through their last check of the text.

The time allowed the indexer depends on the type of book and publisher. A university press book indexer is often allowed between three and four weeks to work on the index. A non-university academic book, including textbooks, may allow the indexer two weeks to complete the index. Technical documentation more often has very rapid turnovers for the index which may sometimes be mere days for the index to be written. Larger projects, such as encyclopedias or large reference books are allowed more time and can even last over months with the text being sent to the indexer a chapter, or chapters, at a time.

The large publishers all have some form of contracts, or sometimes a P.O. (production order), that they use when hiring an indexer. Smaller presses will sometimes be more informal and use email correspondence as the terms of agreement. Likewise, authors may or may not request that a contract be signed with an indexer. My observation has been that indexers differ in their use of either a formal contract or informal documentation as their preferred indexing agreement. When I started out as a new indexer in 1989, publishing was still very much a "gentlemen" enterprise and some of that flavor remains a part of the industry. For that reason, many indexers remain comfortable with an informal arrangement. For those who prefer to use a more formal contract, here is a [sample indexing agreement (Links to an external site.)](http://www.asindexing.org/find-an-indexer/sample-indexing-agreement/).

The indexer seldom has direct contact with the author except in the case of university press books or self-publishing authors. In the case of a university press book, the indexer is often hired by the author via the editor’s recommendation and works directly with author. It is not unusual for the indexer to be paid directly by the university press book author instead of by the press. A self-publishing author is also the one to contact and work with the indexer directly. In that case, the indexer will receive the book .pdf from either the author or the compositor and will then send the index file to the author for review. And, of course, the self-publishing author will be the one to pay the indexer. Some indexers will ask for a 50% down payment when working directly for authors. 

Don't forget to clarify the index specifications and other requirements for the indexing project. Max McMaster has written a helpful summary of the production process and information needed from the client in order to complete the project [Indexing in the editorial process.pdf](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/2714087/files/133417019/download "Indexing in the editorial process.pdf")  [![](https://canvas.instructure.com/images/svg-icons/svg_icon_download.svg) Download Indexing in the editorial process.pdf](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/2714087/files/133417019/download?download_frd=1) . 

Once the index has been completed and approved by the client, the index file will be uploaded and set into the book file by the comp. After the index has been added, the completed book file will be sent to the printer.

## Indexer wishlist
**The Indexer Wishlist or,**

**What Indexers Wish Their Clients Knew About Indexing**

1.  Yes, indexers really do read the entire text when they index a book. Indexes are not written by a keyword software program but by indexers who read the text and select appropriate terms to write an index that accurately reflects the author’s concepts, themes, and message.

.

2.  Indexers prefer receiving .pdf with single pages instead of 2-page spreads. The 2-page spreads result in a very small font making it difficult for the indexer to read either the screen display, or page proof if the indexer works from printed out page proofs.

3.  Another issue related to the .pdf is making sure that the Adobe Reader display of the .pdf matches the actual page number of the page. When an indexer is working from the .pdf screen display, not having accurate page references displayed may impact the accuracy of the index.

4.  Indexers want clients to know how important keeping to the schedule is to indexers. It is not unusual for indexers to be scheduled for several different indexing projects during the same month. When the indexing schedule slips (a delay in the delivery of the .pdf to the indexer) it can cause a domino effect impacting the indexer's ability to fulfill their other indexing project obligations. In addition, there are times when an indexer has turned down a second project that would have overlapped the schedule of the first project. If the first project is delayed, that may leave the indexer with no work for a significant amount of time. Either way, keeping to the schedule is an important aspect of the indexing project.

5.  Indexers often wish that authors had a better understanding of how cross-references function. Editors usually do have an understanding of cross-references but that is not always the case for authors. Indexers have reported being asked to either delete necessary cross-references or to add cross-references that are either unnecessary or even incorrect. For example, adding a cross-reference between two main headings when one of the main headings already includes the second main heading information as a subheading making a cross-reference redundant.

6.  Indexers also wish that both editors and authors had a better understanding of what indexing software can and cannot do. Indexing software can work miracles but there are limitations. Take the repagination of an index as an example of one such limitation. Indexing software can be configured to accommodate a reflow of complete pages, to automatically increase or decrease the corresponding index page references to pages that have been either added or deleted from the text. However, if the reflow is a partial page shift, instead of a complete page shift, then an index repagination becomes a considerably more complicated and time-consuming task. Even a complete page reflow will require some extra work on the part of the indexer, but a partial-page reflow will likely result in additional time and work and may even significantly delay the delivery of the index. It is helpful if the client understands the possible consequences of a reflow and tries to avoid or at least minimize them as much as possible. Repagination is also the reason that indexers prefer to wait on the second pass .pdf if there is any possibility of a reflow of the first pass .pdf.

7.  Understand how an author’s word list is best used by the indexer. A word list can help the indexer to know what is important to the author, and using it as a guide can be helpful. However, being asked to follow the word list exactly or, even worse, just to supply the page references to the terms instead of indexing the text, can quickly become a barrier to delivering a high-quality index to the client. Not every word or phrase in a word list is equally appropriate to use in an index. As just one example, I’ve had clients ask me to use adverbs as main headings instead of nouns, noun phrases, or gerunds as a main heading. Along with that, adding page references to an existing index, whether it be one provided by the author or updating an existing index, can easily be four or five times the work as just writing a new index would take. Surprisingly, I’ve had editors and authors assume that just supplying page references is a much easier task than writing a new index. I’ve even been asked to give a discount “because it will be easier than writing an index,” not realizing that, on the contrary, it will be significantly more work instead of being easier.

8.  Realize that the indexer needs to know if there is a limited number of pages available for the index. Writing an index to fit a specified space is much easier than delivering the index to the client and only then being told that the index will have to be cut down. A good index is an integrated piece of work in which all the parts are interlinked so it is not just a question of chopping out a few entries or reducing the number of locators. Having to cut an index after the fact can easily impact the quality of the index and is to be avoided whenever possible.

9.  Understand what is, and what is not, a realistic index due date. There are times when there will be an unavoidable rush schedule and the indexer is free to either accept or decline the project. But making an arrangement for one schedule, and then drastically shortening the turnaround time, creates a difficult situation for everyone. Offering a rush fee for a very tight indexing schedule is always appreciated by the indexer.

10.  Indexers like to receive the preliminary pages (“prelims”), also called front matter, as well as the back matter in addition to the body of the text. Having the entire book, even those sections not usually included in the index, can provide the indexer with valuable insights into the author’s message and that will facilitate the indexer's ability to write a better index.

11.  Know what sections of the book are, and are not, customarily included in the index. The list of what is traditionally excluded from the index includes the glossary, appendices, reference pages, the author and title citations from the footnotes and endnotes (though the conceptual information from both are included in the index), and the Roman numeral page references..

 It is true that indexers are sometimes asked to include the Roman enumerated preface in the index. Some editors won’t care one way or the other, However, I've observed a number of different reactions among editors who are familiar with the convention of not including Roman numeral page references in the index. Some of these editors will try to talk the author out of including the Roman numeral page references in the index.  Other editors will be unhappy with the request but reluctantly tell me to go ahead and include the Roman enumerated preface in the index. I’ve even had a few editors decide to have the entire book repaginated in order to change the preface Roman numeral page numbers into Arabic page numbers just to avoid the issue and still accommodate the author's request.

In addition, understand how important it is to have "a meeting of the minds" not only on what is to be included in the index but also what the indexing specifications of the project are. Indexers aren't mind readers so they appreciate hearing what the client expectations are in order to write and deliver an index that meets those expectations. Don't tell an indexer to "Follow Chicago" because Chicago lists multiple format options, making such an instruction meaningless. Indexers want to provide the client with an index they will be happy to receive. So help indexers to do that by providing them with all the information they need instead of making them guess.

1.  Last, but certainly not least, indexers appreciate a client who acknowledges the receipt of an index file. Confirmation that the index file and invoice have been received signals the successful conclusion of the project. This is the kind of consideration that should be practiced by both the indexer and client. Mutual courtesy is never out of place and contributes to a positive experience for everyone.
