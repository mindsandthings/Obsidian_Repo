## 1.5 Indexing Structure Formats

The names I use for the formats described in this topic are those in most common use in the indexing field. As a quick reference. here is a list of the various formats you may be asked to use by editors.

- ==Flush-and-hang format: Chicago 16.24
- ==Indented format: Chicago 16.26
- ==Run-in format: Chicago 16.25
- ==Blended format: Chicago 15th 18.28, Example A. Please note that this is a format in the immediate past edition of Chicago 15th and not included in either the Chicago 16th edition or the current Chicago 17th edition, but some publishers may request that it be used so it is pertinent to include in this list.
- ==Sub-subentries in run-in indexes format: Chicago 16.27 (closely comparable to the Chicago 15th blended format).
- ==Sub-subentries in indented indexes format: Chicago 16.28

Now let's define and look at examples of each index structure format.

### Indented Format

In this arrangement, each subheading begins a new line. If sub-subheadings are used, they will also begin a new line.

main heading  
   subheading, 12, 15  
   subheading, 3, 135  
   subheading  
      sub-subheading, 23, 85  
      sub-subheading, 65, 71  
   subheading, 45, 82  
   subheading, 24, 31

An indented format is commonly used in textbooks, references books, and for computer documentation. The simple arrangement of an indented format is easy to read and gives the user straightforward access to each level of the index.

In Australia the predominant style is for indexes to be in an indented format though there can be exceptions. Australians generally refer to this style as set-out format, rather than indented format. The terms however can be used interchangeably.

![Canada flag](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565969/preview)
In Canada there is a mix of format styles similar to the U.S. practice, depending on the type of text and the publisher.

### Run-in Format

This arrangement of the index structure is typically used by scholarly university presses and professional book presses. Sub-subheadings cannot be used with this format.

main heading: subheading, 12, 15; subheading, 3, 135;  
   subheading, 23, 65, 71, 85; subheading, 24, 31, 45, 82

A run-in format is more difficult to read, but the resulting space saved is a strong financial incentive for university and professional book presses.

### Blended Format

In this format, which is used in the index of Chicago 15th, modified in Chicago 16th, and not included in Chicago 17th the indented and run-in formats are combined to create an easy-to-scan index. The main headings and subheadings are written in the indented format, but the sub-subheadings are arranged in the run-in format style. Note that this is the format used for the index of Nancy Mulvany’s _Indexing Books_ 2nd edition, which is part of your reading assignments.

main heading  
   subheading, 12, 15  
   subheading: sub-subheading, 23, 65, 71, 85; sub-subheading, 24,  
      31, 45, 82  
main heading  
   subheading, 103, 105  
   subheading, 25, 38  
   subheading: sub-subheading, 3, 56; sub-subheading, 6, 98, 145,  
      176; sub-subheading, 18, 65, 72  
main heading  
   subheading, 45, 57, 63  
   subheading, 23, 125, 168  
   subheading, 8, 119, 124, 127  

Notice how easy it is to scan the blended format index structure. The sub-subheading groupings draw the eye. This arrangement is advantageous when indexing an extremely dense text that would otherwise end up with a cumbersome and awkward list of multiple indention levels. In addition, the run-in portion of the index takes less space than an index that solely uses the indented style.

### Sub-Subentries in Run-In Format

The previous blended format has been modified in Chicago 17th, Section 16.27 (sub-subentries in run-indexes) as:

main heading  
   subheading, 12, 15  
   subheading  
   ---sub-subheading (general): sub-subheading, 23, 65, 71, 85;  
       sub-subheading, 24,31, 45, 82  
main heading  
   subheading, 103, 105  
   subheading, 25, 38  
   ---\[subheading (general): sub-subheading, 3, 56; sub-subheading,  
      6, 98, 145, 176; sub-subheading, 18, 67, 72  
main heading  
   subheading, 45, 57, 63  
   subheading, 23, 125, 168  
   subheading, 8, 119, 124, 127  

### Sub-Subentries in Indented Format

There are two examples in Chicago 17th, Section 16.28. Example A in an indented index with run-in sub-subentries, and Example B is an indented index with indented sub-subentries.

#### Example A (indented index: run-in sub-subentries):

main heading  
   subheading, 45, 57, 63  
   subheading, 23, 125, 168  
   subheading: sub-subheading, 8, 119,  
      124, 127; sub-subheading, 65, 89,  
      110, 124, 138; sub-subheading, 24

#### Example B (indented index: sub-subentries indented):

main heading  
   subheading, 45, 57, 63  
   subheading, 23, 125, 168  
      sub-subheading, 8, 119, 124, 127  
      sub-subheading, 65, 89, 110, 124, 138  
      sub-subheading, 24
