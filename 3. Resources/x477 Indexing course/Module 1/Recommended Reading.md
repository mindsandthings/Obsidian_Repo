_Facing the Text: Content and Structure in Book Indexing_ by Do Mi Stauber is available through [Domistauberindexing.com (Links to an external site.)](http://www.domistauberindexing.com/). The focus of this book is term selection and index structure.

_[The Indexer (Links to an external site.)](http://www.theindexer.org/)_ is published by the British Society of Indexers and is the best source of trends and opinions on indexing currently available. _The Indexer_ subscription is a membership benefit of SI (Society of Indexers) and ISC/SCI (Indexing Society of Canada) and may be purchased separately by members of ASI (American Society for Indexing) and ANZSI (Australian and New Zealand Society of Indexers) or by individual indexers not associated with any organizations.
