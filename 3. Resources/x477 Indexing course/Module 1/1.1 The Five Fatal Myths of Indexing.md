"What is it you do? Indexing? Now, let me get this straight -- people send you books to read, you can work your own hours and in your own home, and people pay you for this? Where do I sign up?"

Many people looking for a career change consider indexing to be a dream job. Not only does freelance indexing come with the luxury of working in your own home, it can be quite lucrative. Yet, out of the many who actively pursue an indexing career, only a very few succeed. Why is this?

I believe that this high failure rate is connected to the five fatal myths of indexing. Click on each myth below to read about it in more detail.

[Myth 1](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/pages/1-dot-1-the-five-fatal-myths-of-indexing#myth1): No special training is required to learn indexing.

[Myth 2](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/pages/1-dot-1-the-five-fatal-myths-of-indexing#myth2): Anyone can be a successful indexer.

[Myth 3](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/pages/1-dot-1-the-five-fatal-myths-of-indexing#myth3): Clients are easy to find with no need to market oneself.

[Myth 4](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/pages/1-dot-1-the-five-fatal-myths-of-indexing#myth4): It is not necessary to invest in appropriate equipment or to master technical applications.

[Myth 5](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/pages/1-dot-1-the-five-fatal-myths-of-indexing#myth5): One can make a living wage immediately.

### Myth 1: No special training is required to learn indexing.

Too many of those who pursue an indexing career assume that indexing does not require any special training or education: "I love to read; I bet I could index."

To the prospective indexer I would say this: learn the craft. This means learning the correct conventions, rules, and parameters used in the indexing process. Prospective indexers sometimes think they can learn to index by practicing and copying from already indexed books. That technique is invalid, however, unless the correct conventions are being applied during those practice exercises.

The mark of a professional, in any discipline, is the ability to understand and anticipate the requirements of the job. Inadequate preparation, resulting in substandard or incomplete work, is the mark of an amateur.

### Myth 2: Anyone can index.

Indexers share certain personality traits and work ethics. Test yourself. Can you work alone, isolated from other people? Can you work unsupervised, or do you need someone to monitor your progress? Can you manage your time and work under deadline pressures? How comfortable would you be making countless indexing decisions without constant affirmation from colleagues or supervisors? Honestly assess yourself. Does indexing, often accompanied by isolation and extreme time pressures, sound like something you would enjoy? Many experienced indexers do enjoy, even thrive in, this kind of environment, but it's not for everyone.

==Also important: a good indexer must have strong reading comprehension skills combined with the ability to _conceptualize thematically_. These two characteristics are required for good term selection.

What is thematic conceptualization? Concepts, as defined by _Webster's New World Dictionary_, are general notions or ideas. To conceptualize is then the ability to form and organize these notions and ideas.

Most adults organize concepts by similarities -- a kind of _classification_ -- for example, "forming a kind," such as types of animals. Here's an example of conceptualizing by classification:

Classification schema -- cat breeds:  
Abyssinian; Egyptian Mau; Himalayan; Maine Coon; Siamese

Classification is generally undesirable for use as an indexing schema, though it is appropriate for database indexing.

Thematic conceptualization, in contrast, is _an organization within events or themes_. Notice the difference in the same classification schema when we conceptualize thematically:

Thematic relationships -- cats within context of pet ownership:  
allergies; breeding; children; immunizations; selecting a pet

Good back-of-the-book index entries express the _meaning within the context of the text,_ using thematic relationships rather than being simply a list of classifications. This is an important aspect of term selection, and we'll examine it in more detail later in the course.

### Myth 3: Clients are easy to find; there's no need to market oneself.

Marketing is part of the business of indexing. Indexers with experience and a proven track record have an easier time finding new clients than do inexperienced indexers, for whom the client market is quite different.

==In the book production process, the index is close to being the last completed item. If the index is late or needs to be redone for whatever reason, production can be thrown off schedule. That may make an editor hesitate to use a new indexer, and that reality makes it difficult to get those first jobs. Marketing, under these circumstances, becomes a particularly crucial issue for the new indexer.

==Marketing is a constant necessity and should be considered part of the job for all indexers, regardless of experience. **Look to the indexing organization in your regional area, which can serve as both a networking organization and a source of valuable marketing strategies and tips.**

Again, you need to honestly assess yourself regarding the marketing aspect of indexing. Are you willing and able to market yourself? If not, you may need to reconsider your plans for an indexing career.

### Myth 4: It is not necessary to invest in appropriate equipment or master technical applications.

Although an indexing business can be run with little overhead, there are some pieces of equipment you'll need to have. You should buy the best computer you can afford, as well as a good printer and scanner. You'll need to purchase a good indexing software program and learn to use it. Printed business cards and stationary will make your marketing look more professional. A message machine or message service, and an Internet service provider, are necessities. You will also want to put up a website where clients can access information about you and your services.

==The publishing industry is undergoing rapid technological changes. The more technical skills you develop, the more attractive you will make yourself to potential clients. In addition to the three indexing software programs used in this course you will be introduced to several add-on applications that can be used for embedded indexing, as well as to the related skills of taxonomy, database indexing, and abstracting.

### Myth 5: One can make a living wage immediately.

It is this myth that can be the most crucial impediment to a successful indexing business. There are too many prospective indexers who need to make money right away and assume that a new indexing business can produce a living wage immediately. This unreasonable expectation can quickly lead to bitter disappointment and disillusionment with indexing as a career. **It is unrealistic to expect to make a living wage for the first and possibly the second year of freelance indexing.** ==It has been estimated that a freelance indexer needs to have eight to ten clients in order to be able to index full time. We define a client here as a source of repeat business and not just a one-time indexing assignment. Building that kind of client base requires time.==

So how have other indexers overcome this impediment to launching a successful freelance business? Some new indexers are fortunate enough to have someone able and willing to support them while they build up a client base. Other new indexers may have a source of independent means available, either substantial savings or a private income. There are some indexers who have kept a day job while taking on freelance assignments to build up a sufficient client base. I know of one indexer who worked in-house for many years. She was able to go freelance by securing enough work almost immediately from her former colleagues.

Additional cash flow issues are late payments from clients, slip schedules, and deadbeat publishers or authors. Late payments from clients are a continuing problem and may severely impact your cash flow. And slip schedules, when the agreed-upon indexing schedule is postponed by several days or weeks, will also result in the payment being postponed. Deadbeat publishers or authors aren't a common problem but are always a possibility. Given these situations, even a busy indexer may experience financial stress on occasion.

Each new indexer needs to assess his or her financial situation and resources. Again, an honest assessment is needed to make a realistic decision to pursue a freelance indexing career.

No doubt there have been successful indexers who have been exceptions to the rule for one or more of these five fatal myths of indexing. However, for the majority of prospective and new indexers, counting on these myths will lead to disappointment.

The purpose here has not been to discourage prospective or new indexers. On the contrary, our profession is strengthened by the energy of newcomers. However, prospective and new indexers need preparation to ensure a successful indexing business. Proper preparation, in this context, means researching accurate information, doing honest self-assessments, and making informed career decisions.

From this point on, when applicable, you will find information specific indexing practices in Australia and Canada in labeled boxes as those below.

The Australian-specific information is provided by Max McMaster. Max has been a freelance indexer for the past 17 years. Max lectures on indexing to editing and publishing students and technical communicators at a number of Australian universities. He also runs indexing training courses for the Australian and New Zealand Society of Indexers (ANZSI) and other entities throughout Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore. Max has been awarded the Australian Society of Indexers Medal (now called ANZSI Medal) for back-of-book indexing on three occasions. He is a Life Member of ANZSI, and is currently a member of ANZSI Council.

![Canada flag](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565969/preview)
The information on Canadian indexing practices is provided by Heather Ebbs, a freelance indexer, editor, and writer for 30 years, who has written hundreds of indexes in a broad range of subjects and styles. She is past president of the Indexing Society of Canada/Société canadienne d'indexation and a past president of the Editors' Association of Canada. In 1986, she won the Tom Fairley Award for Editorial Excellence. Heather has instructed Book Editing at the Banff Publishing Workshop and Publications Production for Algonquin College.

### A Word about Style Guides

It is important to emphasize here the two primary aspects of indexing. First, the indexing process itself, consisting of term selection and organization into a thematic structure of the index. The second aspect is preparing the index file using the index format style and specifications as required by your indexing client. The first aspect, the indexing process, is generally quite similar regardless of type of text, client, or medium. The second aspect, the required index format and specifications, can be quite different depending upon the style guide followed by your client. This course will help to prepare you to accomplish both of these important aspects of indexing.

There is no universal style guide followed for indexing, but it is important to become familiar with the more common style guides used by publishers in order to provide your clients with the index format they require. The most commonly used style guides in the U.S. and Canada are:

[_The Chicago Manual of Style_Links to an external site.](https://www.amazon.com/Chicago-Manual-Style-17th/dp/022628705X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1512193966&sr=8-1&keywords=Chicago+17th%20) (17th edition)

==[_Read Me First! A Style Guide for the Computer Industry_Links to an external site.](https://www.amazon.com/First-Style-Guide-Computer-Industry/dp/0137058268/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) (3rd edition published by Sun Technical Publications)

[_Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association_Links to an external site.](http://www.apastyle.org/about-apa-style.aspx) (6th edition) (commonly called APA style)

==[_Scientific Style and Format_ Links to an external site.](http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/publications/scientific-style-and-format/)(8th edition, Council of Science Editors)

Note: Though the above style guides are most commonly used, some publishers may have their own style guide for indexes and will provide these guides to freelance indexers working for them.

![Canada flag](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565969/preview)Canadian indexers face two additional challenges when dealing with indexing styles: spelling and punctuation. For both of these, British and American standards differ, and Canadian indexers may be dealing with a text that uses one or the other standard, or an individualized amalgam of the two.

Spelling within books can vary even within one publisher’s list depending on the author’s preferences or a book’s intended market (e.g., North America as a whole or Canada only). If the book uses _color_, _theater_, and _pediatric_, but the indexer is more comfortable with _colour_, _theatre_, and _paediatric_, then the indexer must be extra cautious about following the spellings within the text and not letting her or his "fingers do the talking." Canadian indexers commonly ask for the copyeditor’s stylesheet, which will include both the dictionary used (in Canada, it is often the Canadian Oxford Dictionary) and individual words and terms that differ from that.

Punctuation differences fall into two main areas: the use of quotation mark and the use of the serial comma. In addition to heeding where the primary text uses singular and where it uses double quotation marks, the major concern for indexers is whether the quotation marks fall inside or outside other punctuation. British and American styles differ, with American style almost always having other punctuation fall within quotation marks (one exception is legal text), and British style having the punctuation order dependent on the logic of the sentence. The indexer must follow the style chosen for the text by the author and editor. The use of the serial comma is more straightforward: texts either use it or they do not. It does not arise often in indexing, but it could. So, for example, if the serial comma is used in the text, the indexer would write:

dogs  
   feeding, grooming, and showing

and if the serial comma is not used, the indexer would write:

dogs  
   feeding, grooming and showing

![Australia flag](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565761/preview)
Many Australian publishers follow _The Style Manual for authors, editors and printers_, 6th edition, revised by Snooks & Co. (Canberra: Wiley, 2002).

Australian and New Zealand indexers however essentially follow AS/NZS 999:1999 index guidelines compiled by the Joint Technical Committee.

[AS/NZS 999: 1999.pdfLinks to an external site.](http://www.saiglobal.com/PDFTemp/Previews/OSH/As/as900/999.pdf)

Unfortunately the two approaches between the _Style Manual_ and AS/NZS 999 are not always compatible. Since it is the publisher who is paying you, it is the publisher's guidelines which you will follow.

Australia publishers tend to use the Macquarie Dictionary (Australia’s National Dictionary) as their first choice, and the Oxford Dictionary as their second.

### International Standards

Some international standards may also be of interest though not currently used by U.S. publishers:

BS 3700: 1988 (_British Standard Recommendation for Preparing Indexes to Books, Periodicals, and Other Documents_)

ISO 999: _Information and Documentation; Guidelines for the Content, Organization, and Presentation of Indexes_, International Organization for Standardization (IS0)
