I would like you to introduce yourself. Please read the introductions already posted by your classmates and then post your own message. You are encouraged to respond to other postings and interact with other students throughout the course.

Here is some of the information I would be interested in learning about each of you.

-   Where you are from and your current occupation.
-   Why you are interested in taking this course and what you hope to learn from it.
-   Your technical background, if any.
-   Anything else you would like to share.

Please remember to observe “netiquette” rules including no flaming (rude or hostile comments to other students).
