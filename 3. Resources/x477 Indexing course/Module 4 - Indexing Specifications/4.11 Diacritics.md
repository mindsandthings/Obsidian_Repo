## 4.11 Diacritics

Associated with foreign names is the issue of diacritics. These are the accent marks or special characters included in some foreign names. Below are four commonly used diacritics.

á (acute)  
à (grave)  
ä (umlaut)  
æ (ligature)

Globalization has increased the use of diacritics, or international characters, in publications, and this is becoming an increasingly common issue for indexers. In the past, inserting diacritics was a complex issue, and generally neither indexers nor editors understood the incompatibility issues.

A brief history of the issue: In order for computers to be able to exchange documents and messages with one another, standards were developed so that, regardless of the language in use or the country of origin, each user would see the same words and characters. The ASCII standard was one of the first to establish a set of numeric codes standing for letters, numbers, and symbols. _Some_ Western European diacritic symbols, also called international characters or foreign accent marks, are included in the ASCII standards. Not included in the ASCII codes are Eastern European, Japanese, Scandinavian, and many non-standard Western European diacritics. The ASCII standard, covering 128 control codes and characters, was later supplanted by the ANSI standard, which added an additional 128 characters and codes. Most recently, the Unicode project has taken on the task of establishing a code for every written character in all living languages and many dead languages. Modern computers running the Windows operating system use four-digit codes to identify the most common characters. There are over 95,000 characters in the [Unicode standard (Links to an external site.)](http://www.unicode.org/charts/).

Diacritics coding is an important issue in name/author citation and in non-English language (e.g., bilingual English and Spanish) indexes and one requiring a careful and cautious approach. 

A thorough discussion of diacritics is outside the scope of this topic but, briefly, the Unicode system currently provides the most universal compatibility with fonts and diacritic coding.

In SKY Index, the Translation Table can be used to insert the Unicode values found in the Windows Character Map applet. [Unicode 9.0 Character Code Charts (Links to an external site.)](http://www.unicode.org/charts/) is a website from which the correct Unicode values can be downloaded. CINDEX 3.0 is also able to support Unicode diacritics. Built-in Unicode substitution tables became available in the MACREX Version 7, and, in Version 8, diacritics can also be inserted using a Character Map.

Although the Unicode system remains the best approach to diacritic coding, caution is always advisable since font compatibility remains an issue.

What is generally _not_ a viable approach is one that is sometimes suggested -- that is, for the indexer to open up the index file in Word and then insert the appropriate diacritic symbol(s) into the index. Unless the publisher's compositor will be using Word running on a computer using _exactly_ the same font set (including country code) -- an unlikely prospect -- the indexer may be putting in an incompatible or erroneous diacritic coding (in which case the intended "á" might appear as "Ï").

![book](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565965/preview)As Mulvany says on pages 117-118, diacritical marks are generally sorted like their English equivalents. But, as always, it's advisable to double check with your editor regarding this issue. Not all presses follow this equivalent alphabetizing convention.
