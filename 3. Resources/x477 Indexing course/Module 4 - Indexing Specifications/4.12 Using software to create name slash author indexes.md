## 4.12 Using Software to Create Name/Author Indexes

All three indexing programs that you're using in this course can facilitate the compiling of name/author indexes. In addition, all three programs have excellent technical support to aid the indexer with specific technical problems.

The three software vendors have provided [brief overviews](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/pages/module-4-vendors "Module 4 Vendors") of the capacities of their programs. However, for specifics, you'll probably want to refer to the documentation on their websites.

Remember, the main issues in author/name indexes are

-   Whether to include citations inside parentheses
-   The sorting order of foreign names
-   Diacritic (accent marks) coding
