## 4.6 Indexing Cookbooks

Cookbook indexing can seem deceptively simple to those who have not tried it. In fact, cookbooks are a special kind of technical text, and their indexing presents special problems not encountered in indexing other types of material. As in any technical subject area, it can be difficult to do a good indexing job without special knowledge of cooking and cookbook index conventions. What follows is an overview of some of the special characteristics and challenges of cookbook indexing.

[Thérèse Shere (Links to an external site.)](http://www.shere-indexing.com/) is a freelance indexer in Sonoma County, California wine country. Food and wine books are among her specialties; she has indexed more than 100 of them over the years. She has taught cookbook indexing at ASI's national conference and at local workshops around the country, and is a contributor to ASI's _Indexing Specialties: Cookbooks_ (2009).

### What Makes Cookbooks Different from Other Kinds of Trade Nonfiction?

Cookbooks are reference books -- probably the most common type of reference book in a household. They get repeat use.

There are two kinds of cookbook index uses: searching and browsing. Searchers know exactly what they are looking for and need specific access points. Indexers have to guess where a cook will go first to find a favorite recipe. Browsers may be using the book for the first time; they will be looking for recipes sharing a common feature and need multiple and broader access points. Compared to other types of nonfiction, cookbooks probably have a greater ratio of searching users who know what they are looking for. When space is limited and choices must be made, it may be desirable to prioritize the needs of searchers by scattering information in the index rather than gathering it into fewer broader entries; this goes against conventional indexing wisdom.

A cookbook is a collection of discrete, titled documents: the recipes. Recipe titles are work titles, in a way -- like a poem or song title. As such, the wording of recipe titles has authorial integrity -- that is, indexers should not reword them. Titling styles vary, and that has implications for indexing as well. Titles may be generic and blandly descriptive, or distinctive and highly memorable.

Cookbooks vary greatly in scope and depth, from small collections and single-subject books (100 tomato recipes, say) to huge, encyclopedic cookbooks with hundreds of recipes in dozens of recipe categories.

### Special Characteristics of Cookbook Indexes

Most entries will have a single page reference, because they will point to a single recipe. There's no question of eliminating or minimizing entries with single locators.

Multiple posting is common and necessary: recipes may need to appear as subheadings under as many as six or more main headings for ingredients and recipe categories.

Long subheading lists are common; there may be many more subentries than main entries. Because of this, it is often important to find ways to organize subhead lists by manipulating word order or using second-level subentries. Sub-subentries are not uncommon in cookbook indexes and relatively accepted.

#### Main Heading Types

-   Recipe titles, which may appear verbatim or inverted/rearranged
-   Ingredient names and types
-   Recipe categories. There are conventional categories found in most cookbooks (i.e. desserts, salads, soups), but the choice of category main headings will depend greatly on the scope, depth, and organization of the text and on the amount of space available for the index. Narrow-focus books will require more specific categories as main headings. Categories which mirror the table of contents may be as main headings in the index, or not.
-   Other non-recipe information such as names of people, restaurants, or places; nutrition information; cooking techniques and equipment. These mentions may be found in introductions, chapter introductions and recipe head notes. Some books may have a lot of non-recipe information, others very little.

#### Subheading Types

-   Recipe titles, either verbatim or rearranged and with the key main heading word omitted
-   Non-recipe information: Techniques or "about" pages for a specific ingredient, for example. Indexers have to decide whether or not to allow these subheads to interfile with recipe title subheads.
-   When there are more than a few subheadings (say, eight or so), wording them for readability and logical sort order is important.

#### Cross-References

-   "See references" will be needed for synonym control, most often for ingredient names (i.e. "black cabbage." See Tuscan kale)
-   See also references: As in other indexes, these will be to related or synonymous headings (i.e. “puddings” to “custards”) or from a broader heading to specific types (i.e. "cheese" to specific cheeses). See also references from narrower to broader headings (lemons to citrus; raspberries to berries) may be needed as well.
-   When space is tight, it may be better to post at specific access points with cross-references from broader ones (Beans, See also Fava beans; Green beans). This is contrary to conventional wisdom—it scatters information rather than gathering it. But it gives searchers what they need.

#### Indexability Questions

It can be difficult to decide which ingredients in a given recipe are indexable and which are not. A cook’s knowledge is essential for identifying key ingredients, whether they are major, or distinctive minor ingredients.

The same is true for modifiers in recipe titles. Should "Uncooked Tomato Sauce" and "Drunken Pintos" be indexed under "U" and "D"? What about "Warm Chocolate Cake"? The answer depends partly on available space, but also on distinctiveness and memorability. Searching index users already familiar with a recipe title may well look it up first under its first word, even if that’s an adjective.

Recipes within recipes: A recipe may contain a subsidiary or component recipe, either set off typographically with separate title and instructions, or not. Should these be indexed separately? If a recipe uses a component that appears separately, like the pastry cream in this example, should it be indexed under that component recipe?

pastry cream, 16  
  éclairs, 206  
  strawberry tart, 132

Recipes may suggest variations or ingredient substitutions. Should these be indexed? If so, should there be a qualifier like “(variation)”?

#### Other Special Issues and Challenges

Cookbooks featuring foreign cuisines present the special challenges of foreign words and recipe titles. If recipes have both English and foreign titles, are both to be indexed? What depth of indexing is required for the foreign titles? Will foreign titles be italicized? What about alphabetization of leading function words when foreign titles appear as subheadings? Space can be a problem as well, since the number of recipe titles may effectively be doubled.

-   Page ranges: Will recipes spanning more than one page be indexed to the page range, or just to the starting page? Should there be chapter-length page ranges for recipe categories (or whatever categories the book is organized by)?
-   Are photos or other illustrations to be indexed separately? Only if they appear on a different page than the recipe itself? What if a recipe spans several pages and a photo page falls somewhere in the middle? What about photo inserts (quite common for cookbooks)? Is special typography required for photo locators?
-   Big, encyclopedic cookbooks mean very long indexes with long subentry lists. Subheading organization and cross-referencing are critical. A format which allows the freedom to invert and rearrange titles as subheadings is very important.
-   Single-topic or narrowly-focused cookbooks will require different main heading types. The main entry for the metatopic (i.e. tomatoes, or grilling, or desserts) will be limited; more specific main headings will be required for recipe categories and/or ingredients.

#### Index Format and Style

There are just a few conventional, widely-used styles for cookbook indexes. Virtually always, subentries are indented. Sub-subentries are somewhat common in cookbooks, more common than in other trade nonfiction. Sometimes, a hybrid format is used with subentries (first-level) indented and sub-subentries (second level) run-in; this can be a very readable, space-saving solution.

Differences among the most common styles mostly have to do with capitalization and whether or not recipe titles are inverted or shortened, or "quoted" exactly as they appear in the text. Indexers need to be familiar with these and understand the distinctions between them. Many publishers will have a preferred house style.
