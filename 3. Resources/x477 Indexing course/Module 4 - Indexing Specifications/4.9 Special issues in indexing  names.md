## 4.9 Special Issues in Indexing Names

Special issues include names of foreign origin, names from ancient or medieval eras, and names with diacritic characters. Also included as special situations are names with particles, names with _saint_, compound names, pseudonyms, and names with _Mac, Mc,_ or _M'_. Names with nobility, military, or religious titles also may require special consideration.

### Foreign Names

Foreign names can be difficult because the surnames, from which the sorting order is determined, can be different from American names. For example, Spanish names often appear with a double surname, the first being the father's family name and the second being the mother's paternal maiden name. Spanish names are indexed under the first surname, that is, the father's family name. Chicago 17th Section 16.84 has more information on sorting Spanish names.

Japanese names may appear in text in Japanese order (surname first, followed by given name) or Western order (given name first, followed by surname). It's critical that the indexer verify which order has been followed in the text and whether that order is consistent throughout the text. Once that has been established, the indexer can then sort these names properly under the surname. Further discussion of Japanese names is in Section 16.81 of Chicago 17th edition.

There are some exceptions for the surname rule. For example, Icelandic names are indexed under first names, as are names of Indonesians of Javan origin. Names from ancient and medieval eras are also exceptions to this rule.

It's also important to take into consideration the international versus American treatment of European names with prefixes. For example, "de Gaulle" is sorted under "G" in _Webster's Biographical Dictionary_ as would be expected for an international press. On the other hand, my U.S. university press clients require "de Gaulle" to be indexed under "D" instead of "G." For other individuals, how the name will be sorted will be determined by whether the name has been Americanized by that individual. For example, my maiden name has been Americanized as "DeHoyos" and sorted with the Ds. However, members of my family not living in this country write the same name as "de Hoyos," and their name would be sorted with the Hs. So, the preference of the individual in question will determine how the name is sorted.

![Canada flag](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565969/preview)The practice for sorting names is similar to that used by U.S. publishers. First, follow the author's use, second, follow the sort preferred by the individual, and third, by whichever biographical dictionary is preferred by the client.

![book](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565965/preview)There are some excellent references available on the indexing of foreign names. _The Chicago Manual of Style_ edition has information, in Sections 16.75-16.87 regarding a variety of names, including Spanish, Hungarian, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Indian, Burmese, Javanese and other Indonesian names, and Thai and various other Asian names.

In Chapter 7 of _Indexing Books,_ Mulvany also has extensive information on foreign names. In addition, Mulvany does a nice job of reviewing the treatments of medieval names and European names with prefixes.

### Names with Titles

There are numerous issues with titles. Academic titles and degrees are not retained in indexes. Monarchs and popes are listed according to their ranks rather than personal names. For example, Charles Mountbatten-Windsor is always indexed as Charles, Prince of Wales instead of under his personal name. Titles of nobility are included in indexes and can be tricky for Americans who are not always familiar with them.

![Canada flag](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565969/preview)Chicago is followed for titles of nobility just as in the U.S.

![book](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565965/preview)Some excellent sources are the _New Oxford Dictionary of English, Cambridge Biographical Encyclopedia_, and Section 22.12 in AACR2 (_Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, Second Edition_).

Military titles are not customarily included in indexes, but if the editor insists that they be, there are two possible ways of handling them:

Wright, James D. (Capt.)  
Wright, Capt. James D.

Additionally, there can be some confusion over the multiple ranks of an individual over the course of the book. (This issue is the reason that military titles are best kept out of the index.) The editor will need to give instruction. One approach is to use the highest attained military rank in the index, though this can be problematic if the individual is discussed in the context of multiple ranks.

As with titles of nobility, religious titles are customarily included in indexes, regardless of the religious affiliation. Titles are used for Islamic, Protestant, and Catholic religious leaders, among others. Members of Catholic orders are indexed under their religious names rather than their personal names. In the event that the individual is discussed both prior to and after entering a religious order, a cross-reference may be used to clarify that both the personal and religious names refer to the same individual. And religious ranks, like military ranks, may change over the course of an individual's life. In this case, the highest religious ranking title is used in the index. Roman Catholic popes may be exceptions to this rule, because their activities as both cardinals and popes may be discussed. For example, Pope John Paul II might also be indexed under his birth name, his cardinal title, or all three:

John Paul II, Pope  
Wojtyla, Karol Joseph  
Wojtyla, Cardinal  
John Paul II, Pope (Cardinal Wojtyla)

Depending upon the context of the discussion, all of the above entries might be appropriate for indexing this individual. Cross-references or double-posting, depending upon the context, might be needed to clarify to the reader that these are all the same individual.

### Reporting Name Problems to Editors

Now [review a real e-mail](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/pages/module-4-email "Module 4 Email") that outlines name issues that arose when writing an author index. This e-mail was sent to an editor along with the delivery of the subject and author indexes. Any problems with the author citations in the text and related issues are flagged for convenience of the editor. Please note that there were an unusual amount of errors in this text, so this serves as a good example of what kinds of problems you may encounter with an author index.

### Real email (copied in by me)
Dear (editor's name),

Here are the author and subject indexes. I do have some flags for you regarding the author index.

1.  There were several missing citations in the references:  
      
    O'Hora, Pelaez, and Barnes-Holmes page 244 and 245  
    Griffiths page 269  
    Pelaez-Nogueras, Otto, Peck and Gervirtz page 274  
    Maratos page 327  
    Roth and Gewirtz page 354  
    Bushell and Baer pages 449, 450, 452  
    Steinberg page 463  (there is another Steinberg and Morris on same page which is listed in the references and this may or may not be the same Steinberg)  
    Murrell and Wicksell page 521
2.  The "McGue" citation on page 103 has one name (Iacone) in italics. This  
    is probably a typo.
3.  On page 227 Buholder should be Burholder.
4.  On page 283 Whithehurst should be Whitehurst.
5.  On page 343 there is an author missing from the citation: Hart, Field,  
    del Valle is missing Pelaez-Nogueras.  I have not added the Pelaez-Nogueras  
    in the index (for this specific citation) just in case it really should be  
    deleted from the citation.
6.  On page 456 there seems to be a typo in the name "Joe Lanyg" shouldn't  
    this be "Layng?"
7.  Are these the same individual or not?  
      
    Dougher, M. page 483  
    Dougher, M. J. page 521
8.  Are these the same individual or not:  
      
    Sundberg, M. page 268  
    Sundberg, M. L., page 513
9.  Bandura and Walter page 333 is listed as Walters on pages 465, 473 and in  
    the references. This is probably a typo on page 333.
10.  Are these the same individual or not:  
      
    Walker, D. page 444  
    Walker, D. W. page 135
11.  There is an incorrect format for one name in the Foreyt citation in the  
    references page 566.  
      
    Poston II, W. S. is incorrect and should be Poston, W. S., II
12.  Please note that these "are" two different people and not a typo in the  
    index:  
      
    Rodriquez, J. A.  
    Rodriquez, I. A.
13.  I believe these are the same individual and that one of them is a typo:  
      
    Petersen, A. C. page 465 (in the Silbereisen citation)  
    Peterson, A. C. page 521
14.  Due to some of the missing citations, I was unable to provide first  
    names for the following authors:  
      
    Otto; Murrell; Wicksell; Peck; Roth; Galen; Griffiths; Maratos and Steinberg  
      
    Steinberg may or may not be Steinberg, L. (from the same page is another citation)

Let me know if you have any questions regarding either index. It has been a pleasure working with you on this project.
