## 5.2 Thematic Thinking

Indexers are familiar with the "sin" of using a classification scheme in an index. What is preferable is to conceptualize and write a thematically framed index. So what is the difference between conceptualizing in a thematic versus a classification scheme? First, let us describe the **conceptualize** process as the formation of concepts. Concepts, as defined by _Webster's New World Dictionary_, are general notions or ideas. According to a study by Lin and Murphy (2001)\*, classified concepts may be organized by _similarities_ -- a kind of classification they describe as "forming a kind." Animal species and genus classifications are examples of this type of organization. Or, as Lin and Murphy found, concepts may be alternatively organized by _external relations within scenes or events_. This second type of organization uses **thematic relationships**.

Lin and Murphy use "cake" as an example of the differences between classification and thematic conceptualization. In terms of classification, "cake" can be conceptualized as a _dessert_, along with pies, cupcakes, puddings, and so forth. However, in terms of thematic relations, "cake" can be conceptualized as part of a _birthday_ scheme, including presents, party, candles, and birthday.

Here's an illustration of the different approaches, using a different example:

The Thematic Relationship approach, on the right half of the graphic, relates three safari items, binoculars, a camera, and a Jeep, to the giraffe.](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565823/preview)

Lin and Murphy determined that while children readily think in terms of thematic relations, most adults think in terms of classification schemes. But they found that when adults use thematic relations, there is significant impact on the abilities to construct meaning and perform inductive reasoning. The authors' conclusions are that the use of thematic relations by adults strongly influences their conceptual representations.

So the first step in the Berkeley Way of Indexing is to read the text thematically, allowing the indexer to identify, select, and then arrange terms as part of an thematically organized index.Â 

Now we need to address the process by which we identify and select appropriate thematic terms. That process requires asking and answering the information questions.
