-- why index JCAHO and DHS but not Medicare?  why index the patient safety requirements under JCAHO, but not under DHS or Medicare?
-- why not index the contents of the second IOM report?
-- why "medical errors, mandatory reporting of, 3" but not anything about a relationship? (i.e. by some states?)
-- why "patient safety, JCAHO requirements for, 3-4" when it was JCAHO, DHS, and Medicare all as examples of various requirements? 
-- "select actions for improving patient safety" is a learning objective; why no entries? 

Key components of a successful plan
include 
designing safe systems, 
establishing an effective reporting system, conducting a through analysis of errors, 
identification of the root cause of the system failure 
elimination of blame.

medical errors, cause of, 7 [no - I guess this is metatopic?]
sentinel events, definition of, 7 
sentinel events, reporting required for specific, 7 [no - put under JCAHO as requirer]
reporting requirements for medical errors, sentinel events, 7 [no - put under JCAHO as requirer. why not its own entry?]
[missed: JCAHO, with reporting requirements by and senitenal events defined by]
[missed: medical errors classifications, sentinel events]



adverse events, definition of, 8 [they did not include subentries; sentinel events got one I guess because it has more JCAHO content?]
near misses, definition of, 8 [they did not include subentries; sentinel events got one I guess because it has more JCAHO content?]
close calls, see near misses [they double-posted]
errors of commission, definition of, 8 [they did not include subentries; sentinel events got one I guess because it has more JCAHO content?]
errors of omission, definition of, 8 [they did not include subentries; sentinel events got one I guess because it has more JCAHO content?]
adverse events in hospitalized patients, numbers of, 8t [they did patients, adverse events in hospitalized]
medical errors classifications
	errors of commission/omission
	near misses/close calls


The
implementation of this culture of safety is discussed
in the following chapters.
