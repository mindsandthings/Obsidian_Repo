## 2.2 Identifying Main Headings

Main headings are always nouns, noun phrases, or gerunds. The Chicago 17th recommends that only proper name main headings are to be capitalized, but please note that there are a number of presses that do specify capitalization of all main headings.

Main headings are items that you'd expect a user to look up in an index. These include, but are not limited to, such things as

-   Names of individuals
-   Author citations
-   Legal statutes
-   Historical events
-   Ethnic groups
-   Book and movie titles
-   Geographical locations

**While these types of concrete, or non-conceptual, main headings are relatively easy to identify, it can be much more challenging to recognize the topical and conceptual ideas that should also be included as main headings.**

To identify and then select appropriate topical and conceptual main headings, indexers need to comprehend the message of the author and the meaning of the text. The number of conceptual main headings in an index depends on the type of text. For example, a university press book on the subject of philosophy will have many more conceptual topics than a book on how to plan a backyard landscaping project.

This term selection process will be addressed in more detail later in the course. What is important to understand right now is that main headings are more than simply the obvious names, titles, and other topics mentioned above. An index that does not include the _concepts within the meaning of the text_ is incomplete and will not provide adequate index utility.
