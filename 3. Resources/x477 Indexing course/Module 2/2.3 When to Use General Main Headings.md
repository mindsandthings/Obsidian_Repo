General main headings are main headings that address the primary subject of the book. **The general main heading is the metatopic (or main idea) of the book. Consider that there are different types of metatopics, including the metatopic of the book (the general main heading), the metatopic of a chapter, and even the metatopic of a paragraph.**

General main headings must be used sparingly to avoid the old indexing joke "Did you hear about the book on ornithology with the entry 'birds, 1-297' in the index?" Some indexers actually avoid using general main headings at all. However, **there may be general information on the primary subject that does need to be included in the index and is appropriately placed under a general main heading.** For example, in a book about NATO, there might be general information included in the index, such as:

NATO  
   headquarters of, 10  
   members of, 11-12  
   origins and establishment of, 7-10

And certainly in biographies and autobiographies, the reader would expect to find some index entries under the name of the main subject. Again, such general main headings and subheadings would be used sparingly and only for information that might otherwise be difficult to include in the index under another heading.

Lincoln, Abraham  
   assassination of, 234-238  
   early life and education of, 4-12  
   marriage of, 34-35

General main headings are a topic of debate among indexers. The final decision on how to approach these headings is made on a case-by-case basis and is dependent upon the context of the text and needs of the reader.
