## 2.5 Sorting

The two principle modes of sorting, or alphabetizing, used in indexes are _letter-by-letter_ and _word-by-word_. Chicago 17th recommends the letter-by-letter system, though there are many presses that require the word-by-word system. Both sorting systems are available as automated options in CINDEX, MACREX, and SKY. Although sorting is an automated feature, it is important for you to understand the different outcomes of using these two sorting systems.

![Australia flag](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565761/preview)In Australia and New Zealand word-by-word sorting is almost universal.

### Letter-by-Letter Sorting (Chicago 16.59)

In this system, the alphabetizing goes to the first parenthesis or comma and then begins again. Hyphens in compound words, spaces between words, and punctuation marks (other than the first parenthesis or comma) are ignored when alphabetizing.

### Word-by-Word Sorting (Chicago 16.60)

In this system, the alphabetizing goes to the end of the first word (including hyphenated compound words), first parenthesis, or comma and then begins again.

![book](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565965/preview)Mulvany (pages 113-120) discusses some of the specifics of using the word-by-word sorting order and how to best determine when it may be advantageous to use it.

### Comparing Letter-by-Letter and Word-by-Word (Chicago 16.61)

Review the two duplicate lists of words in Chicago 16.61. One list is sorted by letter-by-letter, and the other list is word-by-word. You'll notice that there are considerable differences in the sorting order using these two systems.

### Sorting Main Headings (Chicago 16.56-16.57)

Main headings are sorted by the first word in the heading with the exception of articles (A, An, and The), which are ignored in the sort. Function words (articles, conjunctions, and prepositions) are ignored in the sort of subheadings. There are two ways to handle this. Using the title of a Hemingway book as an example:

_The Old Man and the Sea_ (Hemingway)  
This is sorted under "O" with _The_ ignored in the sort order.

_Old Man and the Sea, The_ (Hemingway)  
This is sorted under "O."

Alhough Chicago 16th prefers that titles be inverted, many presses may have their own preference and will specify which method you are to use in the index.

### Sorting Subheadings (Chicago 16.68-16.70)

Subentries are most often sorted alphabetically by the first word, excluding function words, defined as prepositions and conjunctions. However, subentries can also be arranged in numerical order or in chronological order. There may be a time when numerical or chronological order is used. Chronological order is often used in biography text.

### Special Sorting Situations

-   **Geographical locations:** There are specific rules for sorting the names of geographical places. Review these guidelines in Chicago 16.90-16.92.
-   **Arabic or Roman numerals:** These are sorted in ascending numeric order. In technical documentation, main headings beginning with numbers are often placed before the alphabetic main headings.

In contrast to technical documentation, scholarly, textbook, and trade book indexes, main headings beginning with numbers have been conventionally sorted as per the spelled out number. For example, the famous 10 Downing Street address of the British prime minister is to be sorted as it is said out loud under “ten” with the Ts. However, as per new recommendation in Chicago 16.65, “if many numerals occur in an index, they may be listed together in numerical order at the beginning of the index, before the As.” This will be a judgment call on the part of the indexer and will depend on the situation and text information. Let us use the example of numbered military regiments from the American Civil War.

1st Indiana Artillery Regiment, 1, 6-7, 35  
7th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, 2, 12-13, 44  
8th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, 2, 15, 18-19  
9th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery, 4, 26  
12th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery, 1, 2-3, 78  
73rd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, 4, 11-15

None of them have subheadings and so listing these entries before the As entries, works well.

However, if the same above entries have multiple subheadings then it would make more sense to list them using the conventional of how the entries are written or said out loud. In that case they would be sorted as follows:

1st Indiana Artillery Regiment (sorted as though it is spelled as “first” with the Fs)  
7th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment (sorted as though it is spell as “seven” with the Ss)

And so forth.

So remember that the new Chicago recommendation on sorting numbered entries has to be applied as it best serves both the readers and aesthetics of the index.

-   **Diacritics (accent marks):** They are arranged just as the equivalent English letter. The diacritics are ignored during sorting.
    
    ![Canada flag](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565969/preview)French accents are common in Canadian indexing, and one occasionally comes up against a situation where two words are the same except for the diacritics (e.g., etude and étude). In such cases, "nothing comes before something," i.e., the word without the accent comes before the word with the accent.
    
-   **Chemical names with numbers:** Subscript and superscript numbers are sorted by numeric value. Numbers that are a prefix to a chemical name are ignored in sort. For example, 4-chlorophenol would be sorted under the "Cs" and not under "F" as per the spelled out "four."
