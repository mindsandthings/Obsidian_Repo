## 2.4 Identifying Subheadings and Sub-subheadings

Subheadings are the subtopics, or subtext, of the main topics of the text. (And sub-subheadings are, in turn, subtopics or subtext of the subheadings.) For example, if we have a main heading such as "basic human rights," there may be several aspects of this topic discussed in the text. It is these different aspects of basic human rights that will make up the subheadings.

basic human rights  
   opposing cultural practices violating  
      child marriages, 155-158  
      honor murders, 158-159  
   outside imposition of, 45-50  
   rights included in, 33-38

Now consider that some of these subtopics will, in turn, also be appropriate main headings. For example, "cultural practices," while being an aspect of the basic human rights topic, is also an important topic itself. So we might see the entries below in the same index as the example above.

cultural practices  
   Affair of the Scarf (France) controversy over, 120-124  
   outside opposition to oppressive, 45-50  
   violating basic human rights  
      child marriages, 155-158  
      honor murders, 158-159

To summarize, subheadings are aspects of main topics, and sub-subheadings are aspects of subheadings. Both subheadings and sub-subheadings have the following characteristics:

-   They are always lowercased unless beginning with a proper noun.
-   They may be used as main headings in another part of the index.
