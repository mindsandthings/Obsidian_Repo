## 2.1 Index Structure

An index structure is made up of main headings, subentries, cross-references, and the thematic relationships between them. **A _strong_ _index structure_ will include clear relationships between all of the entries, as well as multiple access points for the same information.** Here's an example of strong index structure for the hypothetical book _Jack and Jill_:

emergency room care  
   administered to Jack, 6  
   Jill's examination as part of, 7  
   _See also_ insurance

falls  
   injuries suffered during, 4  
   during water search, 3, 5

hill  
   falls during run up, 3, 5  
   search for water up the, 1

injuries  
   Jill checked for, 7  
   suffered by Jack, 4

insurance  
   coverage for fall injuries, 8  
   documentation required by emergency room on, 6  
   _See also_ emergency room care

Jack  
   emergency room care given to, 6  
   fall on hill by, 3  
   fall injuries suffered by, 4  
   run up hill for water by, 1-2

Jill  
   emergency room examination given to, 7  
   run up hill for water by, 1-2  
   tumbling following Jack, 5

water  
   falls suffered during search for, 3, 5  
   up the hill for, 1

A list of nouns or noun phrases, without viable relationships, results in a _weak index structure_:

emergency room visit, 7  
injuries, 4  
insurance, 8  
Jack, 1-2, 3-4  
Jill, 1-2, 5  
water, 1-2

This weak index structure makes it difficult for readers to access information.

In the following lecture topics, we'll take a detailed look at each aspect of the index structure. Finally, you'll build your first index.
