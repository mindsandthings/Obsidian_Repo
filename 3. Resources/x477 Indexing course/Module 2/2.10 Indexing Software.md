## 2.10 Indexing Software

Once upon a time, indexes were produced using the "shoebox" method, which consisted of writing down entries on 3x5 cards (kept organized in a shoebox, which gave this method its name) and typing those entries out in an index structure. The alphabetizing, inputting, and formatting was all done manually.

With the advent of the computer age came KWIC (Key Word in Context) and other automatic generator types of computer programs. These programs produced an automated index of limited value to the user.

Fortunately, indexing software has come a long way. There are many types of indexing programs available with the ability to perform a variety of tasks, saving the indexer countless hours. During this course, you are being introduced to three of the most popular dedicated indexing software programs -- CINDEX, MACREX, and SKY. By using these programs to complete the upcoming indexing exercises and projects, you will familiarize yourself with different indexing software packages and how they are used to write indexes. Don't forget that you have free technical support from each of these companies for the duration of this course. The welcome letter you received by e-mail serves as enrollment confirmation.

### Download the Student Versions

Click on the course [Syllabus](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/assignments/syllabus "Course Syllabus") to find the links to download the software.

Please be aware that these three software vendors, CINDEX, MACREX, and SKY, have all provided student versions of their software to use in this course. These vendors have generously allowed the use of their software in this course. It is therefore important to clarify the following issues:

1.  These donated Berkeley student versions are specifically designed for this course and are not the same student versions available for sale on the vendor's Web sites.
    
2.  The Berkeley student versions are only appropriate for educational purposes and to complete the course assignments. They are not adequate for professional indexing and are not intended for resale under any circumstances.
    
3.  ==The CINDEX and SKY vendors each offer an $80 discount available to Berkeley students who purchase the complete version of these programs. The MACREX vendor offers a $200 discount to current Berkeley students who wish to purchase that software. Students wishing to receive the discount must show proof of registration. This proof can be in the form of any email received from the UC Berkeley Extension Office, including your confirmation of registration email. Be sure to save this email, should you decide to purchase one of these software programs, so that you can present it to the vendor to receive your student discount.

gives a description of each of the primary features used during the indexing process. Keep her list in mind as you use CINDEX, MACREX, and SKY to complete the indexing exercises and projects.

Once you have downloaded the software, print out the documentation for each software package found on the software websites. (These user manuals are PDFs, which require the free Adobe Acrobat plug-in.) The documentation for each of the software packages includes tutorials to help you complete the exercises and practice indexes. These three documentation files are the complete manuals to each program and are lengthy. For example, the CINDEX manual alone is 322 pages long. If your printer has problems printing out such lengthy documents, you may want to print out and learn just the basic functions of each software program, following the instructions below.

### Software Documentation

#### CINDEX

(1) Pertinent information from the _User's Guide:_ The installations provided on the CDs contain the relevant version of the _User's Guide_ PDF. Students on Windows machines may need to be reminded that they may need to "mount" the CD after installation of the program in order to "see" the PDF.

For CINDEX for Windows, Chapters 1-4 are 76 pages long. This includes pages 24-25, which describe how to add accented characters from the Character Palette.

For CINDEX for Macintosh OS X, Chapters 1-4 are 74 pages long. On the Macintosh, accented characters are entered directly from the keyboard, and page 22 makes a note of this.

Please note that both versions come with full online help, including concise versions of the chapters from the _User's Guide_s. Access these from the help Menu in both versions.

(2) Printed version of the _User's Guide:_ The _User's Guide_s for Windows and Macintosh OS X versions are available via the order form at the [Indexing Research  (Links to an external site.)](http://www.indexres.com/) site for $25 each. Shipping charges apply. Sales tax is charged for shipments within New York State.

#### SKY

When SKY Index is installed, you will be asked if you would like to print the tutorial. Answer "yes" so pages 7-17 of the manual will be printed out. The information on how to produce diacritics is found on pages 190-94 and 197 of the manual. You can also purchase a printed manual for $25 through the [SKY website (Links to an external site.)](http://www.sky-software.com/).

#### MACREX

Printing out the first three chapters of the manual is all that is necessary to learn the basic functions of MACREX. Printed manuals are available for $25 from technical support, listed on [the MACREX website (Links to an external site.)](http://www.macrex.com/). Some students find the MACREX learning curve to be particularly challenging; so we are providing a [Macrex Quick Reference](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565959/download?wrap=1 "Macrex.pdf")

for both Mac and PC platforms.

##### Special Networking Offer to Students

Do Mi Stauber and Sheila Ryan run a bi-weekly one-hour live chat called Chet Chat. The Chet Chat members are working indexers who share thoughts on indexing techniques, working with editors, and the business of indexing. Do Mi and Sheila have graciously extended an open invitation to X477 students to attend Chet Chat on a complimentary basis during their course term.

Though Chet Chat is not a part of this course, it does represent a great opportunity to learn from, and build relationships with, dozens of working indexers in a small and intimate forum. I encourage you to take advantage of this generous offer.

-   Tuesdays: 10:30 a.m. Pacific (11:30 a.m. Mountain, 12:30 p.m. Central, 1:30 p.m. Eastern, 2:30 p.m. Atlantic)
-   Fridays: 1:30 p.m. Pacific (2:30 p.m. Mountain, 3:30 p.m. Central, 4:30 p.m. Eastern, 5:30 p.m. Atlantic)

If you would like to accept this offer to network with experienced indexers in an intimate setting, contact Do Mi at [dmstauber@gmail.com](mailto:dmstauber@gmail.com) using the subject heading: “Chet Chat Invite.”

As you go through the tutorials of each program, please make a list of at least three tips that you'd like to share with other students in discussion. If you have a difficult time getting through the tutorials, you may want to access the tips left by other students and go back and try again. Feel free to comment on what you found to be easy or difficult to use in each program.

Also, just a short note about the names of the three software programs: The three vendors differ in how strongly they insist on all capital letters for their programs ("CINDEX," "SKY," and "MACREX"). Indexers, when corresponding on discussion lists, never ever put any of the programs in all caps. So throughout this course, you'll probably notice that we refer to the programs both in all caps and as regular words ("Cindex," "Sky," and "Macrex").
