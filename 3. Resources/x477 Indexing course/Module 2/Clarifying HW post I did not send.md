___Exercise___

For Exercise 1, does "_See also_ cross-references must follow the last subheading" mean that the cross-reference must be a subheading that follows all other subheadings (example A below), or that it should be after the entry's final subheading, as part of a separate entry that repeats the header from the previous entry (example B below)? 

I assumed the former, but Macrex's Merge menu placement option uses "Separate" to mean "print the cross-reference out as a subheading at the end of the list of subheadings" and uses "to End" to mean "print it out as part of a separate entry that repeats the header from the previous entry", which is the opposite of what I expected. (I have verified this multiple times.) 

Example A. Cross-reference as a final subheading (Macrex's "Separate" option):

dogs
 dalmations
 schnauzers
 See also pets

Example B. Cross-reference as part of a separate entry (Macrex's "to End" option):

dogs
 dalmations
 schnauzers
dogs. See also pets
