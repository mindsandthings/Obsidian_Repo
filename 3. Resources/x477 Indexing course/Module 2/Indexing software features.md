**Basic Features**

  

**_Record length:_** The total number of characters available for each entry.

  

**_Total entries:_** Total number of index records that can be contained in a single index file. Most of the programs can get around any limitation by breaking large indexes into smaller alphabetical groups that can later be merged.

  

**_Levels of subheadings:_** The number of subheading levels that can be attached to any main heading.

  

  

**Editing and Displaying Entries**

  

**_Copies previous entry:_** The program has the capability of duplicating all or part of the immediately proceeding entry on the screen.

  

**_Copies any existing entry:_** The program can find and duplicate any record previously entered.

  

**_Flips entries:_** Allows the index to transpose a main heading with a subheading or vice versa.

  

**_Cross-reference verification:_** Checking of cross-references for missing headings, circular references, and related problems.

  

**_Displays specific alphabetic groups:_** Displays a specified alphabetic group of entries regardless of the case of the first word of the main heading.

  

**_Finds text anywhere:_** The program offers a find or search option to locate text regardless of its location in the index.

  

**_Groups together similar entries:_** The indexer can store a group of entries based on results of a search and work with the group as if no other entries existed in the index.

  

**_Macros:_** The ability to store frequently used words or phrases as abbreviations for recall by function keys or other designated keys.

  

**_Onscreen editing:_** The capability of editing entries once they have scrolled off the current work area without having to exit and use a word processor.

  

**_Displays final format onscreen:_** The indexer can view the entire index (or any part) on the screen in the chosen format at any time without first having to print it to a file for viewing with a word processor.

  

  

**Formatting/Printing Features**

  

**_Indented style:_** Automatically formats and prints the index in the indented (line-by-line) style.

  

**_Run-in style:_** Automatically formats and prints the index in the run-in (paragraph) style.

  

**_User-selected format:_** Allows the user to set some unusual style other than selecting the number of spaces to indent subheading, page length, margins, and so on. For example, some programs allow users to right-justify page references with or without filler text, such as a row of dots preceding the page reference.

  

**_Suppresses repeating headings:_** Suppresses the printing of duplicate main headings or subheadings and combines or concatenates the page references for those duplicate entries.

  

**_Combines page references:_** Combines page references for records with duplicate main headings and subheadings.

  

**_Automatic punctuation:_** The program inserts user-selected punctuation before page references, between page references, before cross-references, between cross-references, and after cross-references.

  

**_Creates word-processor files:_** Prints the formatted index to a text file that can be edited by any word processor.

  

**_Two-column format:_** Prints the index in the designated format in two columns on the page.

  

**_Style sheets:_** Allows the user to set up, save, and re-use style sheets (layouts, configuration files, set-up files, format files) to meet the requirements of different publishers or different methods of production. For example, you might have a style sheet for sending an index to a file, for sending the index to the printer, for sending the index to the screen, for including typesetting codes, and so on.

  

**_Inserts print codes:_** The program allows the indexers to insert print codes for word processors or printers, codes which are translated into the desired effect, such as boldface, italics, subscripts, and so on.

  

**_Inserts extended ASCII characters:_** [Please note that this was important several years ago when this list was originally written by Linda Fetters. Since that time this required feature has been replaced by the Unicode system that provides coding for diacritics, special characters, and symbols to be inserted into the index file.]

  

**_Inserts typesetting codes:_** Allows the indexer to choose among preset typesetting codes or to insert specific typesetting codes. The program automatically inserts the codes when sending the index to a disk file.

  

**_Conversion to database file:_** Converts or stores the index entries in the comma/quote delimited field format that can be read by many database management programs. This is useful if the indexer needs a specialized format that the indexing program cannot provide, but which can be created with the report generator of a database management program. It also facilitates the transfer of index files between indexing programs that can read these types of files. 

  

  

**Sorting**

  

**_Letter-by-letter:_** Provides letter-by-letter alphabetizing.

  

**_Word-by-word:_** Provides word-by-word alphabetizing.

  

**_Page order:_** The program can sort the index into page number order either within the program itself or by the use of a separate utility.

  

**_Subheadings by page number:_** Sorts main headings in alphabetic order but sorts subheadings in page number order.

  

**_Ignores articles and prepositions:_** Ignores a specified list of articles or prepositions to be ignored at the beginning of subheadings. Some programs allow the indexer to specify a list of symbols or characters to be ignored, but not a list of words. Others do both.

  

**_Hides specified words:_** Allows the indexer to mark words, symbols, or numbers to be ignored by the sorting routine.

  

**_Allows forced sort order:_** Allows the indexer to insert text enclosed in special characters, which forces the program to sort according to the inserted text rather than the word character, or number at the beginning of the entry. For example, inserting _(ninety) 90_ forces this entry to sort as if the number were spelled out.

  

**_Immediate sorting of entries:_** Sorts entries into the specified order as soon as the entries are stored. This allows the indexer to view the index in alphabetical order at any time without first having to sort the entire index.

  

**_Cumulates indexes:_** Allows the indexer to merge two or more separate indexes into one large index. This capability is limited by the total number of entries that the program allows but some programs have "work-around" methods for avoiding such limitations.
