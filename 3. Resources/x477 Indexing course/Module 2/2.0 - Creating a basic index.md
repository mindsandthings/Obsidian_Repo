## Module 2: Creating a Basic Index

In this module, you will begin to learn three indexing software programs: MACREX, CINDEX, and SKY. Using these programs and provided text, you will practice building a basic index structure of main headings, subentries, and cross-references. You will find links to the software in the Syllabus under Materials.

### Learning Objectives

-   Operate three indexing software programs at a basic level
-   Use indexing software to build a basic index structure with main headings, subheadings, and cross-references
-   Identify and implement the two sorting orders (word-by-word and letter-by-letter) used in an index

### Discussion

In this module, we'll share tips about using the tutorials for our three indexing software programs.

[Module 2 Discussion: Tips on Software](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/discussion_topics/10736086 "Module 2 Discussion: Tips on Software")



##### **  Indexing Live Chat**

Remember to check the Indexing weekly chat if you have specific questions of the instructors. You'll find more information about the chat in our course syllabus. Office Hours, which is what we call the weekly chats held on Canvas every Thursday evening at 6:00 pm Pacific Zone Time, is a great way to interact with other students as well as some of the other instructors. While you are not required to attend these chats every week, you are required to attend at least three Office Hours chats during your course term.

### Assignments

##### **Indexing Exercise 1**

The instructions for Exercise 1 are in [Topic 2.12](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/pages/2-dot-12-indexing-exercise-1 "2.12 Indexing Exercise 1"). Do not attempt to complete this exercise until you have done all of the assigned reading.

##### **Online Research**

- [x] #task Go to the websites of the three indexing software programs used in this course and review the information found there. (Don't download the programs from these links, though. Links to our student versions are in the course [Syllabus](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/assignments/syllabus "Course Syllabus").) ✅ 2022-09-03
