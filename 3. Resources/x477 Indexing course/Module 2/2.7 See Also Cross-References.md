## 2.7 See also Cross-References

_See also_ cross-references are used to alert and direct readers to related information that they may want to access in the index. They tie the index structure (main headings and subheadings arrangements) together and enhance the utility of an index.

### The Chicago 17th Preference (Chicago 16.20)

==Chicago specifies that _see also_ cross-references be in italics and be placed at the end of the subheadings, or the main heading if there are no subheadings. In the event that there are two or more cross-references, they are listed alphabetically and separated using semicolons. An indented index in Chicago style would look like this:

debt  
   defined, 232  
   generational impact of, 54-61  
   ideology and, 15, 154  
   Ricardo effect and, 175, 180  
   _See also_ international debt; national debt

A run-in index in Chicago style would look like this:

debt: defined, 232; generational impact of, 54-61; ideology  
   and, 15, 154; Ricardo effect and, 175, 180. _See also_  
   international debt; national debt

Notice that in the run-in format, "_See also_" is preceded by a period.

![book](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565965/preview)The above formats are the Chicago 17th preferences, but many presses have different specifications for _see also_ cross-references. The tables on pages 68 and 200 in Mulvany list indexing specifications, including those for cross-references, of various publishers.

### Other _See also_ Cross-Reference Styles

Below are three examples of other possible _see also_ cross-reference specifications.

debt (_see also_ international debt; national debt): defined, 232;  
   generational impact of, 54-61; ideology and, 15, 154; Ricardo  
   effect and, 175, 180

debt  
   (_see also_ international debt; national debt)  
   defined, 232  
   generational impact of, 54-61  
   ideology and, 15, 154  
   Ricardo effect and, 175, 180

debt. _See also_ international debt; national debt  
   defined, 232  
   generational impact of, 54-61  
   ideology and, 15, 154  
   Ricardo effect and, 175, 180

### Issues to Consider

#### Main Headings in Proximity

It is not necessary to use a _see also_ cross-reference between consecutive main headings. The purpose of a _see also_ cross-reference is to direct the reader to the additional information, and when the related main heading is so obvious, using the cross-reference is unnecessary.

#### Appropriate Use

New indexers have one of two tendencies when using _see also_ cross-references: they may either underuse or overuse them. Too few cross-references may lessen the utility of the index by not providing enough direction to navigate the reader through the various main entries. Too many _see also_ cross-references may indicate a lack of understanding regarding their function. Remember that a _see also_ cross-reference directs the reader to additional and closely related information. An index will often contain main headings that are in some ways all related to one another, so the judicious application of _see also_ cross-references is advisable.

#### Blind "See also" Cross-References

Be careful not to accidentally create a blind _see also_ cross-reference (one that leads to a missing main heading). For example:

debt  
   defined, 232  
   generational impact of, 54-61  
   ideology and, 15, 154  
   Ricardo effect and, 175, 180  
   _See also_ international debt; national debt

One of the editing tasks is to verify that the main headings "international debt" and "national debt" exist and that there are _see also_ cross-references from their main headings to the "debt" main heading.

==Remember that See also cross-references are circular in nature and must be completed at both ends of the two main headings being connected by the See also cross-references in order to be valid.== Caveat—there may be times when a See also cross-reference does not have to be completed at both ends but this done by an indexer using their experience to best serve the reader in the context of the text. “It depends,” an indexing truism, is also true for See also cross-references but, for the purpose of learning the basics, students are asked for now to match their See also cross-references at both ends of the two main headings being connected by the cross-reference.

#### Italic versus Roman Font

As is the case with _see_ cross-references, a _see also_ cross-reference following a main heading in italics will also be in italics. This will only be an issue when you are using a format in which the _see also_ cross-references immediately follow the main heading instead of page references or subheadings.

The _see also_ will be in roman type when it appears in conjunction with and before an italicized term. For example:

disability groups  
   access to Western goods through, 35-37  
   graded according to category of, 85-98  
   labor capacity loss criteria for membership in, 19, 67  
   See also _fondy_ (funds)

#### Crossing between General and Specific Main Headings

Avoid placing _see also_ cross-references between a general and specific main heading. A general main heading would be the broad-spectrum term, and the specific main heading would be double-posted as a subheading of the general main heading. In the example below, the main heading "basic human rights" is the general, or broad-spectrum main heading, while "cultural practices" is the specific main heading that also serves as a subheading of the "basic human rights" main heading:

basic human rights  
   opposing cultural practices violating, 45-50, 120-124, 155-159  
   outside imposition of, 45-50  
   rights included in, 33-38

cultural practices  
   Affair of the Scarf (France) controversy over, 120-124  
   outside opposition to oppressive, 45-50  
   violating basic human rights, 155-159

==It would not be advisable to place a _see also_ cross-reference between these two main headings: while they are related to one another (one criterion for a _see also_ cross-reference), **one is a subtopic of the other.**

That said, the indexer can judge that in the context of the text, the index structure, and the needs of the reader, it may be appropriate to include a _see also_ cross-reference from "cultural practices" to "basic human rights." Remember that the indexing parameters, or guidelines, can often be adjusted given a credible argument that to do so would be beneficial to the reader and increase the index utility.
