## 2.6 See Cross-References

![book](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565965/preview)Before continuing with the lecture, please review the general principles and uses of cross-references discussed in Chicago 16.15-16.23. You might also want to review the introduction to cross-references in [Topic 1.7](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/pages/1-dot-7-cross-references "1.7 Cross References").

Similar names (such as "cars," "autos," and "vehicles") that all mean the same thing. The indexer needs to select one of these terms and use a _see_ cross-reference to send the reader to that term from the similar terms.There are many reasons to use _see_ cross-references, including:

-   Organizations with acronyms, such as DoD (U.S. Department of Defense). If the text uses "DoD," that should probably be the main heading. However, many readers will automatically look this organization up under "U.S. Department of Defense," so there should be a _see_ cross-reference leading the reader to "DoD."

-   Pseudonyms, like Mark Twain. In this case, readers would be directed to the Mark Twain pseudonym from Samuel Clemens.

### Issues to Consider

#### Cross-References versus Double-Posting

==Do not use _see_ cross-references when there are no subheadings and only a few reference locators involved.== In these cases, it is preferable to double-post the entries rather than cause the reader to make an unnecessary extra effort to look up the _see_ cross-reference. For example:

IMF (International Monetary Fund), 24, 59, 120

International Monetary Fund (IMF), 24, 59, 120

#### Main Headings in Proximity

==When the two main headings in question are close to one another in the index, it may not be necessary to use a _see_ cross-reference.== The purpose of a _see_ cross-reference is to direct the reader to the correct main heading being used -- if the two entries are close enough to one another as to be obvious to the reader, then no _see_ cross-reference is necessary.

#### Blind "See" Cross-References

Be careful not to accidentally create a blind _see_ cross-reference (one that leads to a missing main heading). For example:

drug-related births. _See_ crack babies; low birth-weight babies

When editing the index, the above entry would have to be checked to verify that "crack babies" and "low birth-weight babies" are actually listed in the index.

#### Italic versus Roman Font

When the _see_ cross-reference follows a main heading that is in italics, it will continue the italics. For example:

_epadu. See_ coca leaves

However, if the _see_ cross-reference precedes a main heading that is in italics, the cross-reference is in roman type. For example:

coca leaves. See _epadu_

#### Cross-Referencing between Subheadings

_See_ cross-references are usually between two main headings. However, as discussed in Chicago 16.18-16.20, _see_ cross-references can sometimes be either following or leading to a subheading. Though there may be credible reasons to cross-reference between subheadings, it is important to remember that many readers are not familiar with either this or the _see under_ format and may find them confusing. So the decision to use these particular cross-reference formats needs to be considered in the context of serving the needs of the reader.
