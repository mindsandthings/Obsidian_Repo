# Errata

I found two middle initial errors in the text. I have used the correct middle initials in the index:
* L. M. Andersson's middle initial is given as "A" in the following citations: Pearson, Andersson, & Porath (2000); Pearson, Andersson, & Wegner (2001); Pearson, Andersson, & Porath (in press). In a third citation (Andersson & Pearson, 1999) it is correct ("M"). See https://doi.org/10.1016/S0090-2616(00)00019-X; https://doi.org/10.1177/001872670154110; http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/10893-008). I have used L. M. in the index. 
* E. H. Schein's middle initial is correct in Schein (1992) but missing for Schein (1990). See https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.45.2.109 I have used E. H. in the index. 


I noticed several other issues that do not impact the index: 
* Pearson, Andersson, & Porath is described as forthcoming (page 407) and cited as in press. It has since been published: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/10893-008
* The article cited as Barsade (in press) has since been published: https://doi.org/10.2307/3094912
* One article is in the references but not cited in the text (O'Leary-Kelly, Paetzold, & Griffin, 2000b). Note that this also affects the use of "2000a" for the other O'Leary-Kelly and colleagues article.

Let's use this example. If you have three names in the citation that starts on page 10 and crosses over page 11.
The names on page 10 are Smith, Jones, and Brown shows up on page 11.
For Smith and Jones you will use page 10 as the locator.
For Brown you will use page 11 as the locator.
Does that make sense?

You have to think of an index as being scalable to the text. For example, if the text is 200 pages long you will likely have a 5% of the text as the index or, in this case, a 10 page index.

I also have a question about breaking down main headings into subheadings.

I know I should break down main headings into subheadings when there are six or more locators. Are there heuristics for deciding whether to use subheadings or not when a main heading has fewer than six locators?

I can imagine that length limits might affect it, but we don't have length limits for this assignment, so I'm trying to decide what to smush together into one heading and what should stay as a subheading

However, if the text is 20 pages long, your index is going to be much shorter. Say a couple of pages at the most.

So when deciding on whether or not to breakout subheadings you'll have to consider the amount of detail you are dealing with--does the information warrant being broken down into more detail or not?

Elizabeth, that is an intersting question and the answer if that an indexer has to write the index for several audiences. You'll have the audience who has never read the book and wants to know what is discussed. The audience who has read the book and wants to look up something specific that they remember reading in the text.

The author is another audience and he/she will be looking for their themes, terminology, arguments, and concepts as presented in the text.

And then there is the expert audience who has a sophisticated knowledge of the subject-matter and will be looking up conceptual information.

The indexer has to write an index that serves all of these different reader audiences. That isn't an easy task but it is what is required of a high-quality index.

There are different kinds of style guides for indexes and, depending on the type of text and the style guide followed by that press, you may have very different treatment of author citations.

Do you have any additional questions about author citations? Just be aware that there are different requirements by different publishers.

We do have a discussion of different types of text and publishers and their requirements in the course. You may not have come across that yet.

The rule for author citations is different. You may well have many more locators than 6 or even 10 or more. Regardless, the convention is to not add subheadings for author citation entries.

You have to understand that not all publishers, most especially the ones following Chicago, will have a lot of author citations to add in the index. And there are many indexers who have never even done an author citation index simply because they don't work for publishers who require parenthetical citations to be included in the index. University presses, for example, follow Chicago and you are not going to see a lot of author citations in thoses indexes simply because they don't allow for parenthetical citations to be included in their indexes.

To answer your previous question about combining name entries in a combined index--that depends. Usually, they would all end up being combined under a single main heading. But there can be cases where the individual has a large list of literary works, or artwork, or something else of a similar nature. In that case you'd probably list the individual name as a main heading and also list a second main heading called something like: Van Gogh's artwork (or somthing like that) and list the names of his various pieces of art as subheadings.
