# Module 7 Discussion: Indexing Approach

[Return to Module 7 activities page](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/pages/module-7 "Module 7")

After you have finished your second full length index please reflect on the approach to indexing that you are developing. Are you aware of the steps taken during the writing of the index? What parts of the indexing process do you find to be the most effortless? What parts do you find to be most challenging? What would be most helpful to master these challenging issues? How was indexing a professional, or nonuniversity scholarly, text different from working with the textbook text of Module 5?

-------

I realized that I wasn't consistently applying a process, so for this index I spent some time coming up with one, based on the examples of processes we've gotten. 

Steps I took during writing of the index: 

1. I found with the previous index that when I got to the editing stage I regretted not having highlighted terms in the text, so I kept it open in Zotero (which autosaves) and highlighted terms as I went. I also used the digital sticky-note feature to keep track of where I left off for the day and to note things I had questions about. Zotero lacks the ability to see all search terms in a sidebar, though, so I'm going to explore other PDF readers for the future. 
2. I copied the citations section into an external notes file and marked them off as I encountered them. 
3. While I read, I identified each section's main topic using the who/what/where/etc questions, made an entry, went back and filled it in with subentries, and also made each sub-entry into its own main heading. 
4. I also added in author entries to a separate name index file that I merged in after all editing. 
5. I used asterisks after headings to note possible future double-postings or See references, although I sometimes put in See also references right away. 
6. I double-checked locators and names when putting them in. I also manually checked locators for the names index entries at the end, using search. I kept lists of errata as I went, along with a list of questions to ask in office hours, and I reviewed section 6.10 repeatedly. 


What I found most effortless vs most challenging, and what would be most helpful to master the challenging issues


Effortless: checking and entering names. 

Most challenging: editing. I realized I needed to be able to visually categorize entries into meaningfully related subsets, and to be able to search on those subsets, so that I could focus on smaller portions of the index at a time but still make sure I covered everything. Otherwise, I just got overwhelmed and lost my place. 

I used Cindex's color-coded labels, labeling entries for whether they were "who/where" entries (targets, instigators, stakeholders, etc), "what" entries (related theoretical constructs), "why" entries (antecedents), and "by what means" entries (processes, like escalation, curtailment, etc). Cindex's interface made it a little clunky to use; it would probably be easier to do with hidden/ignored text in Sky or tags in Macrex, and that would also let me categorize an entry as belonging to more than one category, which I think I would find useful.

It helped a lot, though. I don't think I fully understood the relationships between things in the text until I could look at them through a bunch of smaller windows like that. 

It would be helpful to hear about how other indexers do this kind of thing, and if they do it at all. (I know that people group on terms and locators; I'm referring to grouping on information that is useful during the process of indexing but doesn't belong in the finished index.) 

I also wish indexing software had more ability to represent relationships visually. For example, I'd like to be able to use my spatial memory by physically clustering index entries, and by seeing cross-references as physical lines between entries. 


How was indexing a professional, or nonuniversity scholarly, text different from working with the textbook text of Module 5?

I have a master's in social psychology, which is a very closely related field to organizational psychology. I found it easier to imagine the readers for this text. That made some things easier and some things harder - for example, it's very easy for me to take a piece of information and think about what purposes different readers might have for accessing it. If I'd had to make the index shorter, though, it would have been more challenging because I would have had to pick and choose among readers.
