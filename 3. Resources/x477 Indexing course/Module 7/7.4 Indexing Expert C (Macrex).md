Do Mi Stauber is the author of _Facing the Text: Content and Structure in Book Indexing_, and "Jewels in the Cavern: The Special Challenges of Scholarly Indexing." She has been presenting the popular "Facing the Text" workshop since 1997. Do Mi has been chair of the judging committee for the H. W. Wilson Award for Excellence in Indexing. She has been indexing scholarly books, textbooks, and reference books in the social sciences and humanities since 1986.

### Entering

The most important indexing strategy I use is to work in my indexing software. My page proofs are on a rack in front of my monitor, MACREX is open on the screen, and I am making index entries as I read. I watch the index grow as I break down large entries, change wordings, create cross-references, and make notes to myself right in the index file.

The format and style preferences for each of my clients are stored as defaults so that MACREX produces them automatically. This includes alphabetization, cross-reference form and placement, endnote format, and final file format.

I use all available MACREX shortcuts, including keywords to stand for repeated phrases, keyboard macros to automate command strings, and copy and paste. I leave every possible formatting detail to the software. This allows me to concentrate on the content of the text and the structure of my index.

As I read the text, I follow a definite pattern. **Of course, I keep the metatopic, or central topic, of the book firmly in mind. Then I identify the main topic of each section. I capture this local main topic in the index and look for ways to break it down if necessary. Then I go back to find the smaller topics within the section. This rhythm assures that my index will include all important topics.**

**I make temporary wordings and change them globally whenever I change my mind. I double-post and make cross-references as I go. I write notes in the index about alternate wordings, double-posting decisions, topic relationships, and queries.**

**The only marks I make on the proofs are tick marks, one per index entry, on a word in the text that signifies that entry to me.**

### Editing

I edit as I go. Therefore, on a straightforward book, many editing tasks are already done by the time I finish making entries. I do all of my editing on the screen. MACREX tools aid me in many of these editing tasks; for instance, **I use a special marker, produced with a keyword, to identify double-posted entries that have been cross-checked.**

==Here are some of the tasks I do during the editing process:

-   Look back through the text for topics I have missed, using a "checkback" list I keep during the entering process

-   Delete unnecessary subheadings

-   Create subheadings for entries with too many locators

-   Consolidate subheadings within entries

-   Use group mode to view and check double-posted entries

-   Check the alphabetical order for strange entries in which I may need to force the sort

-   Research queries

-   Address any concerns I had during editing, recorded in notes in the index or my word processor setup file (On more complex books, this may involve deconstructing and rebuilding large entries.)

-   Examine each line for errors

-   Group on initialisms (for example, on acronyms) by searching for two capital letters together using a macro, and check that they are either double-posted or cross-referenced

-   Have MACREX check cross-reference accuracy

-   Search my note marker to be sure I have addressed and deleted all notes

When I am satisfied with the index, I have MACREX make a word processor file following client preferences.
