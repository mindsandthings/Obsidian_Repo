## 6.7 Receiving Page Proofs

Page proofs are delivered to the indexer by overnight delivery or via PDF files. The trend is toward sending PDF files as email attachments and having the indexer print out the page proofs. Since a publisher may be charged as much as $0.50/page proof by a compositor on top of overnight delivery charges to get them to the indexer, sending a PDF file is a cost saving measure for presses. Most clients will automatically elect to send out an email attachment to the indexer.

If you are wondering what a page proof looks like, just print out the pages of the West Nile Virus PDF used in Module 5 practice indexing assignment. The pages printed out from that PDF are page proofs and exactly what the client would send an indexer if they were in the practice of sending out page proofs instead of emailing the indexer a PDF.

Publishers requesting an embedded index will more often send out a double-spaced Word document of the text instead of a PDF. This is also a situation where the per word fee structure may be advantageous for the indexer.

Many indexers are choosing to index from the screen instead of printing out either a PDF or Word page proofs. Please note, should you choose to index from the screen, youâ€™ll find it much easier to work with two monitors instead of splitting a single screen in order to view both your indexing software and the page proofs.

When I first started my indexing business, indexes were customarily delivered to editors by overnight delivery. Being a new indexer, I did not understand that this expense was routinely billed to clients, and I was too insecure to ask about it. But as I became more familiar with the business aspects of indexes, I began to add the overnight delivery costs to my invoices, as was customary in the early 1990s. Not one of my clients commented on this either before or after I began billing for the overnight deliveries. They simply didn't care if I was willing to absorb an expense that would ordinarily be reimbursed. It was a good lesson for me.

Over the life of a career, these kinds of expenses can add up to hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Clients expect to be billed for legitimate expenses, so learn to differentiate between overhead expenses that are part of doing business and those that should be included in your invoice.

Large projects, such as textbooks or encyclopedias of 500 pages or higher, are often delivered over a period of several weeks, several chapters at a time. These chapters may even be delivered out of order. Scholarly texts, even when they are large projects of 500 to 600 pages, tend to be sent in a single delivery.
