## 6.1 Indexing Project Process: An Overview

Experienced indexers have all developed their own individual methods of approaching the indexing process. However, there are certain commonalities in all indexing projects:

-   Receiving and accepting an indexing request from a client (either an editor or an author)
-   Setting indexing fees
-   Establishing indexing specifications for the project
-   Arranging due dates
-   Complying with your country's tax criteria on freelance/independent contractor status
-   Receiving the page proofs
-   Estimating index size
-   Indexing the text
-   Editing and proofing the index
-   Delivering the index to the client

There is one more commonality that impacts the indexing process and that is the indexerâ€™s subject knowledge. Addressing and improving subject knowledge of the individual indexer is outside the scope of this course but it is an important topic to acknowledge and be aware of as you market yourself and build a solid client base.

Now, let's discuss each of the above in more detail.
