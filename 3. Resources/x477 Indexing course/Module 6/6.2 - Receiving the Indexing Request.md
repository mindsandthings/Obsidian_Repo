## 6.2 Receiving the Indexing Request

Although indexers may be contacted directly by the author of a book for indexing, most of the time a production editor or project manager will be the one who assigns the indexing project. A production editor is the individual who coordinates the production tasks and manages the freelancers (designers, proofers, copyeditors, and indexers) who are working on the project.

The indexer receives the initial indexing request either by telephone or, more typically these days, by e-mail. It is not unusual for an indexer to work with the same editor for several years without actually ever speaking on the telephone. A first-time contact from the client may come through the recommendation of either another editor or another indexer, or in response to marketing material sent by the indexer. During the initial contact, the client may spend time assessing whether the indexer has the qualifications to index the project before actually offering the job. The client may request that the indexer make a bid for the job -- that is, state how much the indexer would charge to do the index. Indexing fee structures will be discussed in detail in the next topic.

As part of your agreement to take the indexing project, you may be asked to sign a contract with the editor. Typically, this will be a work-for-hire contract that assigns the index copyright to the client.

You will also need to verify that your freelance status is in compliance with IRS criteria. Both the IRS freelance criteria and contracts with clients will be discussed in Topic 6.6.
