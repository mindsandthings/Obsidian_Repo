## 6.6 Complying with IRS Independent Contractor Criteria

In the United States the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) now requires that employers verify an independent contractor's status; otherwise the IRS will consider that individual to be an employee. The independent contractor versus employee status has tax implications for publishers, so this has become an issue for freelance indexers.

Different presses have a variety of methods for verifying independent contractor status. Some have their own information forms that must be filled out by their freelancers. Other presses may send a Form 1099-MISC to be filled out. Still others will request a list of your other clients or even a copy of your Schedule C. Some of these requests may be a violation of your privacy, and you will have to consider how to comply with the more intrusive ones.

The ABN effectively shows an employer that you are a contractor. Without an ABN many publishers are likely to refuse to work with you because it involves extra paperwork at their end. They have to take tax out at a substantially higher marginal tax rate than for normal employees. In effect they have to treat you like a special type of casual employee.
