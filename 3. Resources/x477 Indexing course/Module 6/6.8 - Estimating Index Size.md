## 6.8 Estimating Index Size

![book](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565965/preview)The 5 percent index rule of thumb (Mulvany, pages 69-73) applies to a moderately indexed text. The "Estimates of Index Length" table on page 72 reviews the type of texts and corresponding appropriate index lengths.

Estimating index size is also part of the indexing process. Index size is determined by the following factors:

-   Type of book (scholarly, textbook, trade book)
-   The amount of material covered, or density, of the text
-   The available number of pages left in the signature

Let's review these factors.

Generally speaking, a scholarly text is denser than a textbook or trade book. However, density may vary greatly, even between books of the same category, subject, and/or press. For example, you may have a scholarly book that is written by an author whose writing style is to pontificate over the same concept for several pages, while another author might include multiple issues within one paragraph. The text written by the second author will contain more information, resulting in a denser text and requiring a more detailed index than the text written by the first author, even though both are scholarly.

A book is made up of _signatures_. To understand what a signature is, take an 8.5-by-11-inch paper sheet and fold it in half. What you will then have is four page sides -- constituting a four-page signature. Published books contain signatures that can be made up of eight, sixteen, thirty-two, or sixty-four pages. Generally, a thirty-two-page signature is used. What this means is that when the text runs over the last page of a signature, the press is unable to add single pages as needed. If more pages are needed, the press is only able to add an additional thirty-two pages.

The significance of this for indexers is that if there are only a few pages left in the signature for the index, which is the last addition to the book, it will have to fit that limited space regardless of other considerations. Adding another signature is quite expensive, and a press is unlikely to agree to the increased expense to accommodate a larger index.

A limited number of available pages for the index is not a frequent problem but does come up often enough that an indexer needs to inquire about the possibility. Be aware that editors may not always realize that there is a space problem for the index and will have to get that information from the compositor (who, you'll recall, is the production team member who typesets the book). So do not rely on the editor to automatically let you know if space is going to be an issue -- _always ask._

If you find that there is limited space for the index, you will have to estimate how many index entries you can include. Unfortunately, estimating the maximum number of index entries isn't an exact science and each indexing project will have to be approached based on the individual factors applicable to the specific project. These factors may or may not (depending on the information provided by the editor) include the following:

-   The number of pages available in the signature for the index
-   How many columns in the index (two or three)
-   The number of lines in each column (anywhere from 50 to 75 lines/column)
-   The spaces between alphabetic groups and the turnover lines (will vary according to whether there are alphabetic letters or only spaces between the alphabetic groups)
-   The allowed characters per line

Once you have estimated the maximum number of entries that will fit the allowed space, you'll know the average number of entries per page that you can enter into the index. You will have to track the average number of entries you are making per page as you index the book, and indexing software keeps statistics that you can use for that. Remember that you are only interested in the _average_ per page; some pages will have more and some less. If you begin to exceed the allowed average per page, you'll know that you need to make your entries more general and cut down on the amount of detailed information you are entering. This is a good example of how important it is for an indexer to know the capabilities of the indexing software and how to use it efficiently. An indexer will have to know how to access and understand the indexing statistics recorded by the indexing software. This is the kind of information that can be accessed through the software manual, through the indexing discussion groups, or by using your software technical support

Once the index is completed the index length can also be checked in Word. For example, if the allowed index space factors are that there will be 2 columns per page, each column has 50 lines, 48 characters per line, and there are 5 pages left in the signature, then you will calculate: 100 lines per page x 5 pages = 500 lines and subtract perhaps 150 lines for the spaces between each alphabetic group and the turnover lines. In Word, set the type font to New Courier\*, the font size to 12 characters, and the margins to 4 inches (4 inches x 12 characters = 48 characters per line). In the Word toolbar, select Tools, then Word Count, which will show not only the document word count but also the line count. However, remember that this is only a final check of the index length as you should already have estimated the approximate lines allowed in the index. That way you can write appropriate entries during the indexing process instead of having to delete entries -- perhaps deleting valuable information which needs to be included in the index -- after finding the index is too long for the allowed space.

**\*We recommend using New Courier to check your index size because it is a monospaced font with all the letters taking the same amount of horizontal space. This makes counting the number of characters in a line more accurate.**
