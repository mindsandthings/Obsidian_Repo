### Before You Begin

Check the publisher's style sheet and confirm: 
-   Alphabetization: letter-by-letter or word-by-word
-   Capitalization: initial letter of common noun capitalized or not
-   Locators: elided or full page range (124-26 or 124-126)
-   Notes: form of notes (126n7)
-   Illustrations, tables, and figures: form of locators
-   Cross-reference format and placement
-   Format of index: run-in style, indented style

### While Indexing

1. Identify the metatopic(s) of the document.
2. Keep track of info for an introductory note. 
2. For each chunk of text: 
	who
	what
	where
	why (pertinent subtopic info)
	when (less likely to be a main heading)
	under what circumstances (pertinent subtopic info)
e.g., what main heading may be followed by a who subentry; "who" main heading may be followed by a "what" subentry

1. Index subtopics under the main topic, and as their own main heading

1. Write an entry
	1. Is the keyword the first word? 
	2. Will readers look for it there? 
	3. Does it need an inversion with a *See*?
	4. Where else might readers look for it? Create *See* entries instead of doubleposting. 
2. Main headings are primary access points for readers. Subheadings present related aspects of the main headings broken down for easier access by the reader.

What is this about? Am I catching the themes?

Parallel construction
Grammatical relationships without inversions and with the keyword first
Noun or noun phrase
Avoid inversions when possible
Avoid articles, prepositions, and conjunctions when possible (include only when necessary for meaning)

-   All of the main topics are listed in the index as main headings.

-   The information relating to those main headings is broken down for the convenience of the reader.

-   The double-posted entries, both main headings and subheadings, consistently list the same page references.

-   The same information is listed, and accessible to the reader, at multiple access points.

Do the themes express the meaning within the content of the text? 


1.  What is the _purpose_ (or function) of the text?
2.  Who will the _readers_ (or audience) be for this text?
3.  What is the _author's agenda_?
4.  How do the above answers affect the _indexing approach_?
5.  What are the typical _indexing specifications_ for this kind of text? (More questions to ask regarding indexing specifications will be outlined in Topic 4.3.)
6.  What is the _production time_? Production time is defined as the time line during which the text manuscript is copyedited, revised, proofed, designed, and otherwise prepared for publication. This time line does not include the amount of time it takes for the author to write the original manuscript.




Once you have started, pay attention to structural issues that may develop in your index.

-   Coverage of both general and specific topics
-   Metatopic overload (Are you lumping too much under the overall subject of the book?)
-   Completeness and comprehensiveness of main headings
-   Multiple access points for the same term -- double-posting page numbers accurately
-   Cross-references to move users around the index

#### Main Heading Issues

-   Broad main headings with too many subheadings: break them down into more-specific main headings.
-   Closely related main headings: combine main headings into one main heading.
-   Main headings needing distinctions in meaning: use more than one main heading, not one general heading for all.
-   Wording: use nouns, adjectives + nouns, gerunds, or noun phrases.

#### Subheading Issues

-   Subheadings that have too many locators: break out a subheading into a main heading and link it to the original main heading with a cross-reference.
-   Combine or delete subheadings if there are too many subheadings for the number of pages.
-   Wording: make your wording concise, using keyword access.
-   Sub-subheadings: avoid these if possible, but use with biography, medical, and legal materials.

#### Cross-Reference Issues

Cross-references must match the main heading exactly. Add any additional cross-references that are needed. Avoid the following:

-   Blind references
-   Circular cross references
-   Convoluted references leading to another _See_ references rather than directly to a main heading

#### Double-Posting Issues

Double-posting refers to the use of the same term or concept in different positions in the index (as main heading, as subheading, as acronym). These double-postings must be consistent. A thorough double-postings check also provides a way to look at the index in a different way. Use group mode on main headings and other concepts to find all instances of them within the index. Check these types of headings for consistent page numbers:

-   Direct flipping of main headings and subheadings
-   Subheading as a separate main heading
-   Foreign language terms and translations of foreign language terms
-   Acronyms/abbreviations and full form of name
-   Synonyms with few page numbers

#### General Editorial Issues to Keep an Eye On as You Go

While you're indexing, use the spell-check feature, and keep the following problem areas in mind:

-   Consistency in hyphenated words
-   Name-place organization starting with the same word
-   Proper names: check as you go
-   Inappropriate use of boldface or italic font
-   Parentheses and quotation mark sets
-   Spaces in wrong places
-   Consistency in spelling and capitalization
-   Locators that are obviously wrong -- large numbers, individual locators that should be combined in a page range (79, 79-81, 80)

### Final editing

When you are ready for the final edit and proofing process, allow some time for editorial distance. Start fresh in the morning or after lunch. You will need to counteract the "glaze-over factor" that comes from being involved with the material for several days or weeks. 

Separate pass-throughs for editing and proofreading are helpful, so you don't have to look for everything in one pass. Below is a suggested list of issues to concentrate on in separate passes.

-   Undifferentiated page numbers and synonymous main headings
-   Locators that are obviously wrong
-   Main headings with lots of subheadings and wording of subheadings
-   Double-postings of concepts, synonyms, and abbreviations/acronyms
-   Cross-reference accuracy



### Final checklist

Introductory note

Recheck RTF against specs

Check for >5 locators

Convert *See* entries to doubleposts as appropriate

Check for parallel construction

Main headings must be nouns or noun phrases

- [ ]  Verify double-postings, etc.
- [ ]  Spellcheck
- [ ]  Quick RTF with word processor
- [ ]  Do Cross-reference check
- [ ]  Check entries in PNO
- [ ]  Delete entries without locators
- [ ]  Check highest page number
- [ ]  Check lowest page number
