# Indexing: Theory and Application, X477

3 Credits in Journalism

## Course Description

This course covers the fundamental principles of indexing. The focus is on the basic format, guidelines, and how to approach term selection for indexing. Instruction is applicable to stand-alone, embedded, and Web indexing.

You will be introduced to three indexing software programs, and will use them to complete the indexing assignments. You will also learn about the business side of indexing -- working with clients, handling financial issues, and delivering indexes specific to the needs of different kinds of publishers.

This course is designed for those interested in becoming freelance indexers for university presses, textbook and trade book publishers, business corporations, and technical companies. This course is also appropriate for both in-house indexers and technical writers who want to index their own manuals. Material will be presented on the specific indexing requirements of university press, textbook, trade book, and documentation text.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this course, but you are expected to have strong language and reading comprehension skills. You should also have strong computer and online research skills, as you will need to download and install files, research on the Web, and attach files to e-mail messages.

## Learning Outcomes

This course has three main objectives. They are to

-   Introduce you to basic indexing practices

-   Provide materials and assessments through which you will acquire the skills and knowledge base required to index professionally

-   Give you enough practice in indexing so that you can assess your aptitude and desire to pursue a career in the field

Upon successful completion of this course, you should be able to

-   Understand indexing terminology and use it appropriately
-   Use indexing software to create both stand-alone and embedded indexes
-   Write an index by following format specifications and guidelines
-   Write a simple embedded index
-   Explain the business aspects of indexing, including working with editors and authors

## Course Materials and Technical Requirements

### Required Materials

-   _Indexing Books_ by Nancy C. Mulvany, 2nd ed. (University of Chicago Press, 2005).  
    (_Note_: This book is also available as a Kindle book from Amazon. If you choose to purchase that version, use the "Go to" function in the Kindle to access the specific page numbers listed in each module's reading assignments.)
-   _Indexes: A Chapter from the Chicago Manual of Style, 17th ed._ (University of Chicago Press, 2017).   
    _Note_: This title is a chapter taken from _The Chicago Manual of Style, 17th ed,_ 2017, so if you already own the full CMS, you do not need to purchase the stand-alone chapter.
-   Student versions of CINDEX, MACREX, and SKY indexing software. (Links and instructions are available from the syllabus inside the course.)

You are free to purchase your textbooks from any vendor. Please be sure to thoroughly review the return policies before making a purchasing decision as UC Berkeley Extension does not reimburse students for course materials in the event of a textbook change or an unexpected cancellation or rescheduled course section.

### Technical Requirements

You must use all three indexing programs for three short exercises in the first half of the course. (Afterwards, you may choose one of the programs to complete the rest of the assignments.) Of the three programs, only CINDEX provides a version that works on the Macintosh OS. But students using the Macintosh OS can successfully complete the course in one of two ways: (1) their Macintosh computers must have software such as Parallels Desktop for Mac or Microsoft Virtual PC to run Windows-compatible software, or (2) they must have access to a PC to complete the first three exercises in the course. 

#### LMS Technical Requirements

This course is built on a learning management system (LMS) called Canvas and you will need to meet these **[computer specifications to participate within this online platform.](http://guides.instructure.com/s/2204/m/4214/l/82542-what-are-the-basic-computer-specifications-for-canvas "Confirm your computer meets Canvas specifications")**

#### Optional

Canvas allows you to record audio or video files of yourself and upload them in the course. Although doing so is not required for any of the activities, using these features will enhance your engagement in the course. If you would like to use these features, you will need to have a webcam and a microphone installed on your computer.

## Learning Activities

The course consists of ten study modules outlined in the syllabus. **Each module contains a reading assignment, hands-on indexing exercises, online research, and discussion assignments. In addition, you will complete three indexing projects for which you will write indexes from provided text.**

### Reading Assignments

-   _Course readings:_ As assigned.
-   _Commentaries:_ Instructor commentaries on the assigned material are part of each module. They provide guidance through the assigned material and help you focus on key concepts.

### Indexing Exercises

In some of the modules, you are required to complete exercises related to specific indexing tasks. There are six indexing exercises; the learning objective of each is described below:

1.  Use indexing software to create an index structure with main headings and subheadings that are provided to you
2.  Identify main headings and subheadings and create an index using indexing software
3.  Edit and proof an index
4.  Insert diacritics (accent marks) in a name index using indexing software
5.  Embed index markers in Word and compile an index
6.  Create a simple thesaurus from given terms

### Indexing Projects

In three of the modules, you are required to write indexes from provided text. With each indexing assignment, the level of difficulty will increase. All students will use the same text for the first indexing assignment.

### Online Research Exercises

In many modules, you will be required to do online research about specific indexing issues.

### Discussions

There are two types of discussions in our course.

#### Discussion Assignments

The graded discussions are listed in your module assignments and are what will determine your discussion participation grade.

In Module 1 you'll introduce yourself to your instructor and course mates. For your introduction, you may use Canvas features to record your voice and/or a video or yourself. You may also click on your name at the top of the course and upload a photo so that your course mates and instructor can get a better sense of you.

#### Questions and Answers Discussion Forum

If you have general questions regarding the course, procedures, etc., use this ungraded forum to share them with your course mates and instructor. Your instructor will review this discussion regularly and will help whenever possible; however, please feel free to offer leads and suggestions to comments and questions that other students have made.

## Communication and Office Hours

Although you may use the Questions and Answers Discussion Forum for questions/answers that can benefit all students, of course you can always get in touch with your instructor during the course. You can access course email by clicking on the Inbox link on the Corner Help toolbar (see also [Canvas Overview Video](http://guides.instructure.com/s/2204/m/4210/l/141852-canvas-overview-video)). You can expect your instructor to respond to email within 48 hours of receiving messages unless your instructor has notified the class otherwise (e.g., because of vacation or other reasons).

### Office Hours Live Chat

The weekly Office Hours chats are an opportunity to ask questions about the indexing industry and have access to all of the Berkeley instructors who rotate weekly monitoring duties. We’ve had students explore marketing strategies, the future of embedded indexing, database indexing, or even answer specific concerns on setting up an indexing business and receiving feedback from the unique perspective of that week's monitor. Each of the Berkeley instructors runs a successful indexing business, with many years of experience, and can provide informative details on the life of an indexer.

==In order to access the weekly Office Hours chat, held on the UCB Indexing site hosted by the Canvas LMS, all students will be sent an email invitation from their section instructor to join the Canvas UCB Indexing site. Office Hours are held every Thursday evening at 9 p.m. Eastern time zone, 8 p.m. Central time zone, 7 p.m. Mountain time zone, and 6 p.m. Pacific time zone for one hour. All of the Office Hours chats will be monitored by one of the Berkeley instructors who rotate the Office Hours monitoring schedule. This allows students to interact with all of the Berkeley instructors in addition to their own section instructor. It is not unusual for more than one Berkeley instructor to attend these valuable chats for students.

As part of your discussion participation grade, you are required to attend at least three of the Office Hours chats during your six-month course term. This may be any of the three weeks you choose to attend. You are encouraged to attend more than three Office Hours sessions, as this is a wonderful opportunity to receive informal kinds of information and ask questions of experienced indexers that you might not otherwise have an opportunity to do.

## Grading and Course Policies

Final grades will be assigned according to the following percentages:

-   Discussion Participation  15%
-   Indexing Exercises (6)      20%
-   Indexing Project 1            20%
-   Indexing Project 2            20%
-   Indexing Project 3            25%

You must pass each component and receive a score of at least 70 percent on each Indexing Project in order to receive a passing grade in the course.

### DSP Accommodations

If you are a student with special needs and haven't already contacted the [Disabled Student Services](http://extension.berkeley.edu/static/studentservices/career/#disabled "Disability Student Services") (DSS), please contact the office right away.  Be sure to review the detailed DSP accommodations instructions.

## Academic Integrity, Research, and Proper Citation

As an online student, you are encouraged to reach out to your fellow students in the online classroom to discuss materials and ask each other questions, but there are limits to this collaboration. Reviewing lecture and reading materials and studying for exams can be enjoyable and enriching things to do with fellow students. This is recommended. However, unless otherwise instructed, homework assignments are to be completed independently, and materials submitted as homework should be the result of your own independent work.

As a UC Berkeley student you are bound by the [Academic Integrity, Research and Proper Citation policies](http://extension.berkeley.edu/upload/academic_integrity.pdf "Learn UC Berkeley's policies on academic integrity, research and citatations") outlined in the [UC Berkeley Extension Code of Student Conduct Policy Statement](http://extension.berkeley.edu/upload/studentconduct.pdf "UC Berkeley Extension Code of Student Conduct Policy Statement") dated July 11, 2013 that clearly defines what constitutes cheating, as well as plagiarism and other forms of academic misconduct.

You must review all sections of the Academic Integrity Pledge and Course Policies Module within your Canvas course and complete the following item prior to gaining access to course content: Take the Pledge to Academic Integrity.

  

## Managing Your Time in the Course

While taking an online course gives you much flexibility, it also requires much self-discipline, especially an open-enrollment course such as this one, where you have no set deadlines other than the end of your 6-month time in the course.

You may think that 6 months is a long time. Think again! To complete this course successfully and have a positive learning experience, follow these recommendations:

### Tips for Success

1.  Start right away.
2.  Do the math: 6 months = 180 days. So you have 180 days (including holidays, vacations, and the unplanned events that life may throw at you) to complete 10 modules.
3. ==If you spend an average of 15 days per module, you will have more than a one-month cushion to handle unforeseen events. Factor in the time it may take your instructor to grade your assignments -- up to 7 days. Remember, you can submit only one module's assignments at a time and must wait for your instructor's feedback/grade before you can submit those for next module.==

Reach out for support. If you feel you're falling behind, contact your instructor. Your course mates can also be a source of support, just as they would be in a classroom. You could form your own virtual study group, or even an in-person one if one or more of your course mates live in your area.

## Course Evaluation and Course End Date

### Course Evaluation

### You are an important part of our community and we value your opinion! Before your course End Date, please take a few minutes to fill out a survey about your experience in this course so that we can continue to improve the online learning environment. Your instructor also values your constructive feedback. Course Evaluations are a valuable way for instructors to gain insight on their online teaching practices.

### You can find a link to the Course Evaluation in the final module of your Course. Please note that your identity remains confidential during the evaluation process, and evaluation results aren't shared with instructors until after final grades are due. For questions or technical problems with the evaluation process, please email UC Berkeley Extension’s Center for Instructional Excellence at teach-extension@berkeley.edu.

### Thank you in advance for sharing your thoughts with us!

### Course End Date

Your access to the online classroom will expire on the course End Date, which is indicated in the initial e-mail you received when you enrolled.

You have six months (180 days) to complete this course from your course enrollment date. University policy requires that you have spent a minimum of 3 months in the course -- and have fulfilled all requirements. There are no exceptions to this rule.

As you work through the course, please keep the End Date in mind, and if you want to save any commentary or assignments for future reference, please make sure to print or copy/paste those materials before your access ends.
