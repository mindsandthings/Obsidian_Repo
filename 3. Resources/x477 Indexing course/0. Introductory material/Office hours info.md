Hi, Elizabeth,  
  
No, we don't have a published schedule of which instructor is on duty for any given week. (We have an internal schedule, of course, so we know when it's our turn.) There is no specific pattern, and for each week we have both a monitor and a backup. That way if the monitor is unavailable for some reason, the session is still covered. We also sometimes need to switch things around unexpectedly (we're all working indexers, after all), which is part of why we don't post a schedule.  
  
If you have particular questions that you want to ask me, you can always send me an email. You don't need to wait for office hours. You can send them here, or you can send them to me directly at [khmillis@gmail.com](mailto:khmillis@gmail.com). I can also tell you that the next time I should be the one handling office hours will be November 17.  
  
I hope that helps.
