#### welcome!

Dear Elizabeth,  
  
I see you have signed up for the indexing course. Glad to have you aboard!  
  
It will take a little bit for you to get the books, and until then you can read up on the beginning lessons on the web site. (You can download the indexing software immediately.) When you get to the ordering process in the first lesson's welcoming material, there's a link to take you to the store.  
  
Discussion Board  
Familiarize yourself with the discussion board and how it works. The discussion board will become more active as this section gets additional students.  
  
Please post any questions about the course material on the Q&A discussion so that other students may also benefit from the questions and answers. Whenever necessary, you may also email me directly. I will try to answer you within 24 hours, although there may be periods when I am working to deadline when it may take a bit longer. If you do not hear from me within a reasonable time, it may well be that your email went astray, so please resend it.  
  
Feel free to reply to any message on the board, no matter when it was posted. You will eventually have about 14 cohorts who will be going through the class, so do talk to them!  
  
Be sure to consider how you will need to schedule your time for the course. It's a good idea to plot out your next six months, looking at your own vacation and holiday time, and periods when you know you will be busy. Work out a good deadline for you to hit for each lesson, working around your own busy periods, and try to stick to those deadlines.  
  
Office Hours  
==The course instructors hold regular "office hours" using the conference feature of the Canvas educational software every Thursday evening at 9:00 pm Eastern; 8:00 pm Central; 7:00 pm Mountain, and 6:00 pm Pacific Time. (Note that this happens on a separate instance of Canvas from this Canvas learning software.)  
  
It's a great place to find lots of indexing information and learn from each of the instructors, as we all take weeks in turn. As you’ll see from the syllabus, 
- [x] #task ==you are required to attend 3 office hours sessions during the course of your six-month registration. Let me know when you attend an office hours session so I can mark that as part of your grade. ✅ 2022-11-23
  
- [x] #task Please send me your email address so I can send you an invitation to join the other Canvas. You will also receive an email invitation to each week's office hour about ten minutes before it starts. ✅ 2022-11-23
  
Email Responses  
I try to return regular class assignments within two days, and the indexing projects within seven days. If you send something to me, and you don't hear back, please do contact me. I nearly always send a message confirming receipt of your assignment, but emails can get lost or not delivered, and I would rather be safe than sorry.  
  
Online classes take a lot of self-discipline, and every technique you can muster to keep yourself working through the lessons and on deadline will help. Indexing is also very much a self-directed profession, so developing the ability to work towards a hard and fast deadline is a good skill to master. Set your deadlines, and try to set specific times to work on the class each week; develop a routine that becomes a pattern for you. Some students set aside an evening or two every week, some can fit in time during the day. Try to find an open time each week to do your readings and work.  
  
If you have any questions, send them my way. Questions that the entire class can benefit from should be posted on the discussion board. Questions that should only go to me can be sent to [khmillis@berkeley.edu](mailto:khmillis@berkeley.edu) or to [khmillis@gmail.com](mailto:khmillis@gmail.com).  
  
Have fun, and welcome!
