Threading potassium iodide info (in case of Russia)

Potassium iodide helps reduce potential thyroid damage from nuclear radiation. You take the potassium iodide and it "fills up" your thyroid for 24 hours, preventing it from taking in any radioactive iodine. 

Salient points:


* We will have days of warning before needing it. Officials are supposed to tell us whether we need it or not. 
* It only helps protect the thyroid, not anything else. 
* The CDC recommends it only for people who are under 40 or pregnant and breastfeeding, but sometimes recommends it for older people depending on exposure levels.
* Dose is on back of bottle. One tablet for adults, one-eighth tablet for children age 1 month to 3 years. (The CDC recommends giving it to children as an oral solution; they have instructions for making the oral solution from tablets.) 
* One dose gives protection for 24 hours. Officials are supposed to tell us if another dose is needed after 24 hours. 
* We have 14 tablets so we can share with others if needed. 
* It's in the red backpack under our bed, in a blue supplement bottle.
