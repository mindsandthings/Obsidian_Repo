I'm also a career-switcher, though from book publishing to tech writing. What helped me land my first full-time role is staying up to date with the job board on the Write the Docs Slack workspace. There I connected with anyone looking for a writer. I found the most success in interviewing with those looking for contractors. Pros in doing contract work include putting a job on your resume, and receiving a higher hourly wage than salary. The downside is if you are looking for benefits, you likely won't receive them. This is why you may receive a higher hourly wage to account for the lack of benefits. I did contract work for a major company for three months and got hired at my first full-time job soon after.

Assuming you’re interested in software/hardware, you’ll want to be somewhat familiar with the following:

Command-line interface

HTML

CSS

Any programming language will give you an advantage (not a requirement for all companies)

Git, GitHub, version control in general

UX (read The Design of Everyday Things)

Agile software development

If you want to be a technical writer in the software industry, you definitely want to have HTML, CSS, JavaScript (basic usage of them all) and Git on your resume. I suggest you create a free GitHub account (if you don’t have one) and start some short and simple projects to actually use Git.

Update: and Markdown too—which you can also use in GitHub

Actually, interpersonal skills are really incredibly important. They define the job almost as much as being good at writing.

You're going to spend a lot of time advocating for people who aren't in the room. You'll be telling the programmers they're designing something that isn't user friendly, you'll be telling the UX/UI people that the designers are overworked and maybe they can cool it until the next update, you'll be telling the marketing people to chill with the overdesigning and the UX people made a style guide for a reason, and so on. You're kind of always playing politics - although you're more so a white knight for the user than anyone else. This means you're sometimes the only one in the room who says "no", and there's a degree of interpersonal finnesse that comes with that.

A lot of a TW's job is also very journalism-like. You need to interview your subject matters experts with a degree of open-minded skepticism. Everything they're telling you might be accurate, and everything they say eventually needs to be translated into language that the least of the end users can process. You'll always be trying to get the SMEs to explain what is actually going on - not just their own pet head canon of how things work - and what all these dang TLAs mean. Also it means reading people. Some people you say "I'm sorry but I'm not sure I understand" and others you say "this passage appears to be stupid" -- all according to the humour and disposition of the individual. Being too polite or not polite enough or too crass or too familiar can turn off certain people. This takes a degree of being able to read someone.

As for being a "good" writer. Most of the writing that gets sent to me for copy editing is charismatic and charming and interesting -- and I just fucking paint it with all the red ink. Technical writing is about being clear, which often means "boring". Marketing and the occasional "About" section can be interesting and engaging, but be prepared to accept that most of what you'll be writing is cold, clean, and boring. If it isn't boring, you may not have written it well. Just like you need to adjust your social stance when speaking to SMEs or advocating for the user, technical writing involves a lot of shifting of tone and detail. You'll spend most of your time looking at whole sections saying "this text serves no function" and deleting a whole day's work (either your own or someone else's). It's rough, but good copy editing is also surely a part of the job. And it's hard.

This is not to discourage you btw... just adding some context.

tldr; TW is more than just writing. It has a massive social and inter-personal component that you really need to be comfortable with (at least in most jobs - I have colleagues who only speak to their direct manager).

my finishing up in government pushed me back into the private sector and aviation - as a Document Controller/Tech writer

Agencies for tech writers:

I rarely work for an actual author, but for medcomms agencies, who I charge

by the hour. They are pretty good on the whole at understanding what is

needed and their budgets are usually generous.

The EFA rate chart is 100% invalid. The history of the chart is that 100 or so

people respond to the survey, not all are editors or proofreaders or writers

or whatever, not all define what they do the same, not all are freelancers. It

is one of the least meaningful guides to setting rates available. One rate

chart had a total of 15 freelance copyeditors giving fee information. The

problem was that there was no uniform basis for how they calculated their fee,

or of the rationale for the amount charged, or what services were included in

the charge. One editor I know who did participate in that particular survey

told me she was retired and had cut her fee in half because she didn't really

need the money but wanted the occasional project to work on. My point is this:

experienced editors should know better than to consider the EFA survey as

having any value whatsoever as a guide for setting their fee and should not be

telling newer editors to look to it. The reply that is usually given is that

it is better than nothing, or it is the only thing out there, or at least it

gives the range. (1) It is not better than nothing; what is better than

nothing is determining for yourself what your required effective hourly rate

is and using that as a starting point. (2) It is the only thing out there

because no one has taken the time to do a proper broad-based survey. But

because it is the only thing out there doesn't make it useful. (3) The range

it gives is meaningless if you do not know the foundation data for the range.

Besides, how do you square the range it gives with the actual numbers that

your competitors quote? The EFA says $25 an hour for copyediting, but what is

included as part of the service? Is it for fiction or nonfiction? Advanced

physics books or consumer vitamin books? Is it for an editor with 1 day of

experience or an editor with 40 years of experience? Is it for an editor who

lives in New York City or one who lives in Sioux Falls? Is it for an editor

with no college degree, a BA, an MA, or a PhD? Does the range represent the

responses of 2 editors or 2,000 editors? Are the responders U.S.-based editors

or international? The list of foundation information needed to make the data

useful continues on. The EFA may do many good things, but this survey is not

one of those good things.

My top tip for freelancing online without having to get into an under-bidding war with global talent on common freelancing platforms: Find books in your specialty. Go through them with a fine-toothed comb. Send errata. Ideally pick similar books for the same one or two publishers. You may have to do this 6-8 times, but eventually, some managing editor will decide it works better for them to pay you to find the mistakes BEFORE books go to print, and you become a freelance technical editor. Succeed at that a few times, and opportunities to be a freelance author appear because you're now a known quantity to that publisher. You've now added a nice line to your CV that can be used to market you as a credible known quantity to other potential freelance clients.

My second tip: Work some 3 to 12 month gigs through contract agencies. Be aware that these will have a 6, 12, or even 24 month non-compete period attached, during which you can do no work for that client unless it's through that agency. Gigs are good, because you can introduce yourself to many potential future freelance clients in a relatively short period of time. Impress them (in fact, meet and impress as many people in each org as you can.) Resist the impulse to take another gig with the same client during the non-compete period. As the non-competes expire, contact the clients directly. Voila, pipeline of prospects.

My third tip: Same as second tip, but with full time employers. This is third only because you tend to have to put in more time in order to generate that potential future freelance client. (That said, I've had 3 of these during my career, because between 5-10 year periods of freelancing, I go for a few years of stability in full time employment.)

Functional documentation: suitable for just getting started with a new product; explains what you see in front of you; helps you find your way through the product. Often used for physical products.

Functional documentation not that helpful in the software world.

the TW HQ one sounds fine, you can also look for courses in Fiverr Learn, Udemy, Skillshare, and Coursera

You won't need coding experience or knowledge in your industry, but it helps to be able to read and understand code, particularly Java, Json, XML, and Python, so look for a basic courses for those. XML will also be useful when using DITA Or documenting APIs.

I'm taking the technical writing course through U of Wisconsin Eu Claire. It was the highest rated one on a bunch of lists, and it's been really great so far. The added benefit of this is that it's given me a metric ass load of things to put into my portfolio. Like they have you create a style guide, write lots of directions, user guides, etc. My portfolio at the end of this is going to look really nice. I'd suggest it! It also doesn't take that much time. I get most of the coursework done in one Saturday morning.

https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/ - API documentation, pays well. documenting for developers.

Information Architecture, from O'Reilly publishing (often called the polar bear book because of the cover) is the classic introduction to the field. There were a couple of key pieces that made things click for me in The Inmates are Running the Asylum as well, but the idea of personas is a bit dated in modern software development.

Design for How People Learn by Julie Dirksen is a good spot to start for instructional design.

And as a bonus rec, read The Lean Product Playbook to pick up PM skills to develop your ability to guide a documentation vision and strategy.
