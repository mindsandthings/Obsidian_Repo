Need to focus on four areas:

- Education
- Tools knowledge
- Experience
- Networking

Check out what employers list in job postings to determine tools, then learn those (or similar ones). Look for open-source versions, take advantage of student discount, etc. 

For portfolio, focus on actual products. 

Search for "technical writer volunteer" or check volunteermatch.org. 

Look for OSS. 

Look for freelance work (eg upwork). 

LinkedIn professional user groups (she really does recommend this)

Plan networking at conferences
