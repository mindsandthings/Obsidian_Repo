Here is the "Full 34" booklet of my brief definitions, just for you in this class. Please do not share this booklet with anyone. This is for your class material only. I do this for two reasons.

One is: I want you to **focus** on the five that are the strongest for you.

Two is: It will be much more difficult for you to understand the Strengths that you don't have. It's not worth trying to spend your time understanding things that aren't strong for you right now. If you are coming across questions in the definitions because there's something that you don't have high, but you know someone who does, please do contact me via email and we can discuss them!
