I am trying to be selective and careful and not overcommit, and will need to do that moving forward with OSS volunteerign if I do that.

In writing, I'm trying not to overshedule myself.

# Aug 2022 areas of focus

You have to know what you committed to and make sure they know too. Make sure you understand when they're speculating/considering and their plans are still open to change, and when they're ready to implement.

Always ask "What am I committing to here? What are the parameters? What's the job description?" I'm in control of how this commitment happens. Don't assume that everybody has responsibility or will do something just because they say they will.

Align yourself with those who share your sense of commitment.
