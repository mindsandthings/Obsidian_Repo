Maximizer notes:

a development strength, like learner

good to great

if you think something is perfect and someone tells you it isn't, that can feel very personal - you wouldn't show someone something if it wasn't the best that you could do

not fame/notoriety-focused

a checklist of "hey, you need to move forward"

develop a system where whatever's written gets locked down and you can't touch it


* What you can let go and what you can't
* When you think something is perfect and someone tells you it's not, that can feel very personal
* Not a cocky wanting to be the best, an internal drive to be the best
* Knowing when something is good enough is a big deal
* Developing a checklist of knowing when you need to move forward 
* This is why editing is so hard - you're constantly focusing on weaknesses and mistakes
* There's a place in the publishing industry for very good books

# Becca 6-10 handout notes
The best question a Maximizer can ask is: what does success look like, and can I get that from doing what I'm doing?
