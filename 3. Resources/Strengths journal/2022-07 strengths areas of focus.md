Deliberative: Reserve 20 minutes each day to sort through your projects, plans and ideas. Use this time to gather information on options, assess different situations or solidify choices you need to make. When you have the opportunity and freedom to calculate, you will make better decisions.

Analytical: Identify credible sources you can rely on.

Connectedness: Help others see connections and purpose in everyday life.

Connectedness: When you meet new people, ask them questions to find common ground and shared interests that you can use as a starting point.

Responsibility: Align yourself with those who share your sense of commitment.

Intellection: Set aside a few minutes every day to collect your thoughts. This reflection time will energize you, and your thinking will become sharper and more effective.

Learner: take at least one new class each year; do time-limited classes so it's easier to leave (unless it's a group of people).

Learner: keep track of your learning progress and celebrate the progression from one level to the next.

Learner: make sure my decisions about what to learn and what to invest in and take into account implementation barriers for later work.

Input: what to do about the big problem, that the things I'm knowledgeable in I can't deal with anymore.

Responsibility: you have to know what you committed to and make sure they know too. Make sure you understand when they're speculating/considering and their plans are still open to change, and when they're ready to implement.

Responsibility: Always ask "What am I committing to here? What are the parameters? What's the job description?" I'm in control of how this commitment happens. Don't assume that everybody has responsibility or will do something just because they say they will.

**Highlight (Yellow) Page 120 If you are highly success-oriented, you have to surround yourself with people who reframe your self-confidence for you. Take yourself out of situations where you feel a lack of confidence. Put yourself into situations where you are reminded of how good you are and how what you're doing is right. Cut out the places that don't support this message. (And listen to me carefully here:) No. Matter. Where. They. Come. From. And. No. Matter. How. Hard. It. Will. Be.**

Highlight (Yellow) Page 50 You’ve subconsciously made the wrong decision just before you stopped (or you’re about to make the wrong decision just after, in the story). It might be as simple as going out the wrong door, so as to meet the wrong person, so as to change the plot in a less high-stakes direction.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 50 always, this subconscious awareness has to do with the stakes. You’ve somehow kneecapped the stakes. You’re not aware of it. But you have to follow that thread to its logical conclusion to be able to see what’s gone wrong. Again, this often requires feedback of some kind (either someone asking you questions like a beta reader or an editor), or a plot bunny hunter or book coach. It might require out-loud processing, or it might not.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 127 Decision Trees are step-by-step yes-or-no questions where each “yes” answer has an outcome and each “no” answer has an outcome. We use these a lot for developing the thinking skills associated with writing. “Do I see what happens next, yes or no?” If the answer is “yes,” then I put, “Sit down at the manuscript, put your hands on the keys, and start writing what I see.” If the answer is “no,” then I ask the next question. “Do I know the motivations for the characters in the scene?” If the answer is “yes,” then I have one action, and if the answer is “no,” then I have another action.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 152 The Waiting Period is a period of time you wait before you make a decision based on someone’s advice. It’s similar to The Automatic No (which is saying no to everything first, and then coming back 24 hours later with a yes if that’s what you decide eventually), but this is more about setting a waiting period for yourself. If the decision is driven by adrenaline, then the Waiting Period can be as short as 20 minutes (that’s how long it takes for the adrenaline spike to subside). Or if you really do need to remove yourself from the situation that’s requiring the decision, the Waiting Period might be 24 hours. It depends, from person to person. But set a designated waiting period for yourself, and then every time you feel that someone’s emotions are about to cause you to make a quick decision you may regret later, just enact The Waiting Period.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 153 Three keys to The Waiting Period. 1) Change your state. If you were sitting down, stand up. If you are in the car, pull over. If you are on the phone, hang up. If you are walking, sit down. Whatever your state is when you’ve been called to make the decision, change it. 2) Set a timer or set a reminder. Do not let yourself “wing” the timing. Otherwise, you’re going to come back before the time has expired. 3) Do something else in the meantime. Do not sit around waiting for the timer to pass. Do the laundry. Load the dishwasher. Pay the bills. Go for a walk. Read a book. Make dinner. Do something else while you wait for the timer to pass. As a general rule, don’t watch the timer. Wait for it to go off. Then, the Waiting Period is over.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 65 your intuition might be wrong at times, but it won’t get more capable if you don’t exercise it. It won’t become smarter if you don’t trust it. If the fear of being wrong or the fear of failure is keeping you from trusting intuition, then I highly recommend working on that as your development project following reading this book. Increasing your ability to be wrong, or your ability to see failure as the path to success will pay off exponentially. This might be the most important skill an intuitive can possess.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 99 If you think back to who you were as a writer, before you decided to “become a writer” and learn how it’s done, what was different? What was easier? What was better?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 110 There’s something about knowing the nuances of the character that will provide the “lock-in” for these writers. Typically, as they’re writing, they have to keep referring to the characters and who they are in order to solve plot problems. In fact, more often than not, any stuckness in a book can be solved by returning to the coordinates. Character coordinates might look like: Emotions in the scene Emotional arc throughout the book Conflicting motivations Character backstory Trajectory of character development What a character needs to learn Every character-driven writer connects with a slightly different manifestation of character coordinates.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 120 I’ve Done Something Wrong But I Don’t Know What: When this type of don’t-know-what’s-wrong intuition happens, there will always be a fix that presents itself once you start digging in. It will often be a painful process

Highlight (Yellow) Page 121 What I’ve found to be true for almost all writers who get to this place is that there’s a particular type of intuition coordinate (character, ending, turning point, stakes, etc.) that’s causing the glitch. Typically, knowing which one drives your orientation will help. The real key for this type: It’s okay not to know.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 125 Questions to ask: “Has ‘just writing through it’ worked for me in the past?” and “What’s my first instinct?”

Highlight (Yellow) Page 125 I Need to Know What Happened This is an offshoot of something-is-wrong-but-I-don’t-know-where vigilance. Typically, when you feel the “something’s wrong” feeling, your immediate response will be to look all the way forward or all the way backward. (What happened to them before the book started, or how is this going to end?)

Highlight (Yellow) Page 125 Knowing motivation from the start won’t stop this from happening, because the motivation you think they have and the motivation they show you will often be different.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 127 Questions to ask: “Have I gone back and read a couple of chapters?” and “Do I need to go back to the beginning of the book?”

Highlight (Yellow) Page 128 One Of These Details Is Wrong: You might need to read a book (research or another fiction book). Maybe watch a documentary. Or open the (gasp!) internet to research.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 129 Questions to ask: “Is there something I need to research?” and “Is there a nagging question I need to answer about the character?”

Highlight (Yellow) Page 129 some writers will switch back and forth between different types of vigilance even within the same book. The key isn’t that you have to be one type. They key is diagnosing what’s going on so you can get through the stoppage quicker.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 132 The other 5/8 of writers bounce back and forth between needing to know something and needing to know nothing. This segment is the hardest place to be when you’re first starting off because you’re never sure just how much to plot and how much not to. Often, those of us in the “middle” of the extremes have to do a lot of experimentation about how much information we need and don’t need. Therefore, our process can change almost from book to book while we discover how much we need to know.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 137 This is where we need to differentiate between intuition and skill. \[...\] **When it’s intuition, it will be backed up by personality alignment. It will be backed up by a desire to find more certainty about what happens next. It will be supported by a desire to make sure you do justice to the story or the characters. We’ll see a need to process more deeply or to think over something. Intuition is always backed up by something you don’t know.**

Highlight (Yellow) Page 139 Not wanting to edit is often an intuitive goal misalignment with the goals of editing. When it’s intuition, it will be backed up by not caring how someone else thinks the books hit. It will be supported by a lack of desire to do it ‘right” according to an external standard or by a knowledge that I’ve done what needs to be done in the story and it doesn’t need to be changed. We’ll see a comfort with the books selling however they’re going to sell. “I’ve done it the way I want to do it.” That’s what it sounds like when intuition is at play.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 142 When you can see where your intuition was leading you in one direction, you can start to help your autopilot ask better questions on the way through the draft the first time.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 145 If we’re intuitive, or if we’re abstract, or if we’re big-picture, we want to edit for intuitive concepts, abstract concepts, or big-picture concepts. We want to edit for coordinates. Are my characters making compelling choices that create conflict (internal or external)? Are the stakes high enough? Do they have enough to lose (internally or externally—not all stories are the same balance of those two)? Are my threads getting tied up and opened? Are there open threads somewhere that I could be touching? Am I pushing the action forward? Am I complicating things or raising stakes or changing trajectory?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 146 Every type of intuition coordinate has a different set of questions they’ll want to ask of themselves. Each of those examples of questions are things I will routinely pull out to ask writers if they’re headed back into revisions. Rather than focusing on rules or structure, I try to focus with intuitive writers on the coordinates that guide them through the story. If they are character driven, we focus on characters and their feelings and motivations. If they are plot driven, we focus on turning points and raising stakes. If they are sense-of-place writers, we focus on the environment and the events.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 147 if editing causes fear because you’re afraid you don’t follow the rules, stop using that editing process. Find your coordinates instead, and find your vigilance areas, and work to your own set of rules. Not an arbitrary set of rules.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 148 becoming better at intuition is about building the three parts of your autopilot. Continuing to push good data at your sensors. Honing how you feed your coordinates. Strategically engaging your vigilance.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 150 we can also start reminding our wise self that we do need to feed our sensors. That means consuming good story. In any medium that works for you. Build the sensors.

**Highlight (Yellow) Page 151 How To Develop Your Coordinates: pick out all the types of coordinates you’ve used in the past. Copy those descriptions or the questions onto a piece of paper (or use the Stuck List workbook we discussed earlier2). Keep that accessible as you write and plan. Coordinates are the place in your autopilot where you can have a bit more awareness, because they’re often the reason you get stuck. Knowing what questions to ask when you’re stuck is the big key to developing your intuition.**

**Highlight (Yellow) Page 152 How To Interpret Your Vigilance: go into the descriptions from the Vigilance Types chapter and make notes about which ones really resonated for you.** When you see yourself following a common pattern, it’s so much more likely that the fix we outline for that pattern will work for you.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 168 Experiment with your intuition and see what produces the best results. It’s genuinely difficult to build trust in intuition if you’re not willing to let it be right and be wrong.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 170 Yes, learning can be helpful. But if you’re intuitive, nothing will be as helpful as iteration.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 192 Make sure the person is a patient-with-questions person. You absolutely need to be able to ask questions of an expert when you’re an intuitive. You’ll catch some things very quickly, and some things not as quickly. Patience is key and willingness to answer questions.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 202 To Write Great Books \[...\] we’d discussed how important it was that the books were as good as they could be. Not just good enough, but as good as they could be.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 204 Given the goal of “great books,” they were as productive as they could possibly be. It wasn’t a waste of time to focus on quality, for them, because that was the promise they made to their readers.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 222 If a person isn’t willing to step inside the snow globe with you and believe you are right about what you see, they are not worth listening to. For intuitives, or really, for anyone. But especially for intuitives.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 243 In order to truly move past the situation, we have to accept the fact that we didn’t know something, or that our intuition missed something. We do want to be curious about how the “missing it” happened. Typically, when we work through this in coaching, we’re looking for the data that our sensors were picking up. What was making me believe this was a good idea? Was I not casting a wide enough research net? Was I afraid of failure? Was I listening to a particular person who doesn’t have my best interests at heart? Was I trusting certainty = correct? What was the cause of the intuitive failure? The more compassion I can have for my past selves and how they handled things at their best, the more quickly I can move past the failure and into the learning curve.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 246 It may seem strange to think that there’s a part of you that needs forgiveness from another part of you, but that’s exactly what has to happen when intuition is wrong. We have to see that little part of ourselves that was doing its best and bring it back into the fold. **Keeping it outside in the rain isn’t going to do anything. It needs to be forgiven and integrated.** Moving forward, the intuition has to feel like you trust it again. As a collective, you need to know which data to trust and which data to seek out, yes. You do want to learn from the experience. But, absolutely, re-integrate the intuition after the acceptance, so you can move forward with intuition on your team again.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 247 Strategize **Now that you’re all on the same team again, it’s important to strategize about how not to end up in that place again. If there are groups or people you need to stop listening to, make that happen. If there are markers to be on the lookout for, keep vigilant. But most of the time, what happened in the past won’t replicate itself, so the biggest strategy we can implement is moving forward with trust in the intuition.** No more punishing. No more past-excavating. Forgiveness, and forward motion.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 248 Find Intuitive-Friendly Environments A huge part of teaching your intuition how to be smarter is about who you surround yourself with (because your sensors are always taking in the data of the people around you). When people understand intuition and are supportive of it, you’re in an intuitive-friendly environment.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 249 She said, “You need to find someone who knows you really well, and who tends to give you advice based on what they know about you, and will ask questions where they don’t know.” This is the intuitive-friendly environment. It is essential, when you hone your intuition, that you surround yourself with people who believe you. People who will step inside your snow globe and listen to what you have to say and believe your intuition.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 250 The intuitive-friendly response is not, “But you don’t have experience.” It is not, “But you don’t know that for sure.” It is not, “But it goes against every best practice we know.” It is not, “show your work,” in that power-over, condescending voice. It sounds more like, “I wonder why your intuition went there,” in a curious, friendly, let-the-deer-come-to-you voice.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 251 just because she liked me or because I was trying to be helpful, those weren’t good enough reasons for her to keep being coached by me if my natural coaching style was making her question her intuition.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 253 Sometimes, you need baby steps, and sometimes, you need leaps. And sometimes, you just need to survive and get through. In order to hone your intuition, you need to become more aware of what you need in order to be at your best. When you are in a time of life that is exceptionally difficult, and your body and mind lock up if you don’t feel safe, then you need safety. When you are in a learning curve, you might need baby steps, or a step backward. And when you need challenges, you need challenges.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 264 Living the intuitive life, from here on out, is all about living as though your intuition is your superpower. It means creating environments that are intuition-friendly. It means making space for intuition to happen unhindered. It means shutting down sources of input that are damaging your intuitive ability to function. It means nurturing your ability. It means taking action when you feel an intuitive push. For some of us, that will mean making space for more silence. For others, it will mean making space for more action.
