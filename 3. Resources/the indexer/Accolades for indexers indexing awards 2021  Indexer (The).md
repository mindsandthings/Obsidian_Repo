## Abstract

Within the indexing societies, the achievements of outstanding members of the profession are recognized by a variety of awards. These awards are usually presented during the societies’ annual conferences and are duly reported in _The Indexer_ throughout the year in conference reports. We have gathered them together here for an overview of the awards and their latest recipients in 2021.

Within the indexing societies, indexers’ achievements are recognized by a variety of awards, some for excellence in the practice of their craft, others for their contribution to the indexing society and the profession more generally. Here we provide an overview of these awards and their recipients in 2021.

## American Society for Indexing (ASI)

Neither the Theodore C. Hines Award (ASI’s highest honour recognizing those members who have provided exceptional service to the Society) nor the ASI Excellence in Indexing Award (honouring excellence in indexing of an English-language monograph or other non-serial work published in the United States during the previous calendar year) were awarded in 2021.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.10#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup>

## Association of Southern African Indexers and Bibliographers (ASAIB)

The following awards were presented at the ASAIB online conference on 20 May 2021.

### ASAIB Award for Best Indexer

Elsabé Nell received the ASAIB Award for Best Indexer 2021 for her index to _Decolonisation as democratisation: global insights into the South African experience_, edited by Siseko H. Kumalo (published by HSRC Press in 2021). Elsabé works in the Department of Library Services at UNISA and has been indexing since 2013, specializing in arts and humanities, religion and social sciences. The runner-up for the award was Rita Sephton for her index to _The unicorn baby_ by Roxanne Atkinson (published by Jonathan Ball in 2021).

### ASAIB Award for Best Bibliographer

## Indexing Society of Canada/Société canadienne d’indexation (ISC/SCI)

### ISC/SCI Ewart–Daveluy Indexing Award

The ISC/SCI Ewart–Daveluy Indexing Award is presented each year to an individual who has created an index that demonstrates outstanding expertise in the ability to analyse complex text and to design an index that significantly enhances reader use of the text. The Ewart–Daveluy Indexing Award was presented to Stephen Ullstrom on 27 May 2021 at the virtual ISC/SCI conference. The award honours Stephen’s indexing of _The shield of Psalmic prayer: reflections on translating, interpreting, and praying the Psalter_, by Donald Sheehan, published in 2020 by Ancient Faith Publishing. See the report in the September 2021 issue of _The Indexer_ for further details, including Stephen Ullstrom’s response to the award.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.10#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup>

### Tamarack Award

The 2021 recipient of the Tamarack Award was Siusan Moffat. This award recognizes ISC/SCI members who go ‘above and beyond the call of duty’ in their volunteer work for the Society. Siusan was chosen for her drive to help ISC/SCI be more representative of the diversity present in Canada by setting up the Inclusion, Diversity and Equity Committee (TIDE) and looking for ways to publicize indexing to people from marginalized or otherwise underrepresented groups.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.10#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup>

### ISC/SCI Diversity in Canadian Publishing Bursary Award

The winner of the 2021–2022 ISC/SCI Diversity in Canadian Publishing Bursary Award was datejie cheko green. With this bursary, ISC/SCI aims to help achieve equality of opportunity for aspiring indexers belonging to underrepresented and/or marginalized groups.

## Society of Indexers

### Betty Moys Award

The Betty Moys Award was established by Betty Moys MBE, distinguished indexer and formerly the Society’s honorary treasurer, who left a generous legacy to the Society to provide an annual prize for a new indexer. The prize has been presented since 2002 to the best newly accredited indexer in the calendar year. All candidates who successfully complete the SI training course between 1 January and 31 December, based on the marking date of the practical indexing assignment (PIA), are automatically considered. The successful candidate will have received high marks in all the test papers; the comments of markers and PIA advisers are also taken into consideration.

Graine Milner was the recipient of the Betty Moys Award for the best newly accredited indexer qualifying in 2020 and had the distinction of having qualified in the fastest time in recent years. She has a degree in library and information science, and has worked for many years not only in a variety of library settings, but also in programming, database administration and website design. Indexing appealed to her for many reasons, including the possibility of pursuing it part-time while building up a client base and the sudoku-like satisfaction of all the pieces coming together. Her subject specialisms are psychology and humanities, computer science, popular science and secondary-school educational publications.

Anna Lord was highly commended for the award and, like Graine, also achieved high marks on the SI training course. She has a BA Hons in English and history and an MSc in information studies, and had a previous life as a librarian, followed by ten years in arts marketing, first for an independent cinema, then for a theatre. Maternity leave and the pandemic furlough brought the opportunity to rethink and retrain, and indexing was the perfect choice; working with books feels like her natural habitat. She has extensive copywriting and editing experience and also offers proofreading services. She specializes in arts and humanities, with a particular fondness for history books.

The awards were reported in the SI’s annual report and announced at the SI online conference on 10 November 2021.

### Honorary membership

Dennis Duncan was awarded honorary membership of the Society of Indexers by a unanimous vote at the SI AGM in recognition of his role in publicizing indexing and indexers and his close links with the Society. Duncan’s book, _Index, a history of the: a bookish adventure_ was published in the UK in 2021 by Allen Lane and in North America by W. W. Norton in 2022. A review of the book is included in the December 2021 issue of _The Indexer_.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.10#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup>

## Institute of Certified Indexers

### Purple Pen Competition for New Indexers

The Purple Pen Competition for New Indexers was won by SI member Ruth Martin for her index to _All manner of ingenuity and industry: a bio-bibliography of Dr Thomas Willis (1621–1675)_ by Alastair Compston (published by Oxford University Press in 2021). Following a degree in English literature from the University of Oxford, Ruth’s career as a law librarian and an information manager eventually led her to freelance book indexing via writing abstracts and index entries for journal articles in Thomson Reuters _Legal Journals Index._ The Purple Pen competition is open to indexers around the world who have recently completed an indexing training course and a back-of-book index for a publication in English.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.10#fn6" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn6">6</a></sup>
