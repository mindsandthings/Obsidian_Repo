## Abstract

The joint coordinators of the International Committee of Representatives of Indexing Societies (ICRIS) explain how communication between the indexing societies has been maintained during the COVID-19 pandemic and look ahead to future developments.

## What is ICRIS?

ICRIS – the International Committee of Representatives of Indexing Societies – consists of representatives from the indexing societies of the US, Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland and China, and the indexing networks of the Netherlands and Germany. It was established following discussions at the 1998 American Society for Indexing (ASI) conference to formalize and establish reciprocal relations between the indexing societies through an international agreement.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.8#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> A key feature is regular communication, both at formal triennial meetings, when any changes to the international agreement are discussed, and more informally at indexing conferences and through an international email list. Since _The Indexer_ is also very much an international concern, the editor also participates in the triennial and informal meetings.

## The impact of COVID-19

Indexing conferences have been online events for the past two years, and for most of 2022 this will continue to be the case. However, the Berlin conference, with the ICRIS triennial meeting, is expected to be the exception, and a hybrid conference is at the planning stage. But more about that later. As a consequence of conferences going online, the informal meetings of ICRIS liaisons that used to take place around these events could not take place and the planned 2021 triennial meeting was postponed for a year. The board of the Indexing Society of Canada/Société canadienne d’indexation (ISC/SCI) came up with the excellent idea to replace the ICRIS informal meetings with a Zoom meeting every six months to exchange news between indexing societies. The Canadian indexers kindly offered to host the first two meetings and meanwhile the British Society of Indexers (SI) has offered to host the Zoom meetings in 2022. The Canadians also carefully worked out the timings of these meetings, which meant that we had participants from Western Canada to Eastern Australia at each meeting. Admittedly, some of the participants had to rise very early in the morning while others had to stay up until late at night, but it worked wonderfully. Indeed, at both meetings in 2021 attendance was much greater than has traditionally been the case at informal meetings and much was achieved.

The full minutes of all meetings are published on the ICRIS website,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.8#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> but some highlights of what was discussed are noted here. At both meetings we talked about the size of membership of each society: is it increasing, decreasing or stable? What events/meetings are societies organizing in times of COVID and is sufficient indexing work available? There are not really any general patterns to be drawn from each society’s presentation but a few general remarks are in order.

Several societies are facing dwindling membership numbers due to retirements (ANSZI, NIN). Others experienced no drop in membership in the past two years (e.g. ASI, CSI, SI) or even a growth in membership (ICS/SCI).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.8#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup> Some societies noted that there is plenty of work available (e.g. NIN, SI, ASI) whereas others worry about whether there is enough work available for their members (e.g. ANSZI).

### Conferences

Conferences were a hot topic of discussion. Hybrid conferences seemed the way to go for 2022, but meanwhile both ASI and ISC/SCI have reverted to online conferences in 2022. For now, it seems that only the Berlin international conference in October 2022 will be a hybrid one. We discussed the pros and cons, and especially the feasibility, of going hybrid. It is more costly to offer a hybrid conference and it is nearly impossible to offer the full programme both online and physically. For conference venues that include accommodation, a hybrid conference is probably not economically viable. The Berlin conference will not include accommodation, however. Participants will be free to book their accommodation of choice. This makes the organizers reasonably confident that going hybrid (at least to some extent) is a viable option for that particular conference.

Also, the latest news about the Berlin triennial conference was presented. The conference will take place on 17–18 October 2022, with the ICRIS triennial meeting the day before on 16 October. This is directly before the Frankfurt Book Fair, so for those travelling from overseas, it is easy to combine a visit to the book fair with attending the triennial meeting and conference. There is now also a website for this conference at [https://dgi-info.de/continental-connections-international-indexing-conference/](https://dgi-info.de/continental-connections-international-indexing-conference/). The conference is jointly organized by SI, DNI and NIN and the programme will include a keynote speaker from each of the organizing countries:

•

Judith Flanders of the UK, speaking on the history of the alphabet

•

Professor Urs Säheli of Germany, speaking on the sociology of indexing and list making

•

Professor Kiene Brillenburg Wurth, speaking on the future of indexing and non-alphabetic indexing.

### Other matters

Many societies currently organize online training activities (e.g. ASAIB, ANSZI, ASI, SI and ISC/CSI) and all societies and networks keep in touch with their membership via Zoom meetings of different kinds. These have proved invaluable in reducing the isolation of the freelance indexer during the past two years.

A point of discussion is the visibility of ICRIS itself and whether the ICRIS website should remain part of the _The Indexer_ website.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.8#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup> Perhaps, some have suggested, now that _The Indexer_ is being published by Liverpool University Press, the time has come to have an independent website for ICRIS. A working group has been set up to investigate the options and report back to the next ICRIS meeting.

## The future

We can safely conclude that the ICRIS informal Zoom meetings have been a great success, with nearly full participation of all ICRIS member societies and networks. One of the main advantages of the Zoom meetings over the informal ICRIS meetings at conferences is the much higher participation rate. So perhaps these Zoom meetings are here to stay. We will see. Certainly they have led to a greater sense of being part of one worldwide community of indexers.

For now the next informal ICRIS Zoom meeting is planned for April 2022. If readers of _The Indexer_ would like to suggest an indexing-related topic that they would like to see discussed among indexing societies, then they should let their ICRIS liaison know.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.8#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup>
