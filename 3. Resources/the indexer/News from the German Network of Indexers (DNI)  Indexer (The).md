Publication: The Indexer: The International Journal of Indexing

Volume 39, Number 1

On 12 November 2020 the German Network of Indexers (DNI) met for its first online general meeting, organized by Walter Greulich, because the usual annual meeting during the Frankfurt Book Fair had to be cancelled. Walter has gained experience in organizing such meetings in other contexts. The technical basis was the online conference tool BigBlueButton, which ran via a server in Germany. Of the total of 13 participants, about 60 per cent were permanently or temporarily connected via video and audio, the rest only via audio. Operation was largely trouble-free.

The agenda included the new DNI website, the status of the forthcoming international conference 2021–22, the activities of sister and partner organizations in Germany and abroad, new developments in indexing software/methods, publications by DNI members, exchange of experiences and ideas for networking. In fact, the need to talk about the new website ([www.d-indexer.eu](http://www.d-indexer.eu/)) was so great that this took up almost the entire two hours.

The main features of the new website are:

•

members can (but do not have to) manage their own entries

•

potential clients can more easily find an indexer

•

people who would like to join DNI can express their interest by filling in a form

•

the members’ area provides typical functions of social networks (like forums, direct message exchange between members)

•

the members’ area also offers all members the possibility to set up online meetings themselves (via the Jitsi tool) or organize larger online meetings with the BigBlueButton tool

•

the connection with the international indexing scene is brought to life by, among other things, the aggregation of the latest news from sister associations.

In principle, these innovations were welcomed, but it also became clear that work still needs to be done on the information architecture of the website. In addition to a revision of the menus and the distribution of information on static and dynamic pages, two important goals were set: the establishment of a job placement system modelled on the job list of the American Society for Indexing and the creation of a professional A–Z index of the website. The old website ([www.d-indexer.org](http://www.d-indexer.org/)) therefore currently still exists in parallel, due to technical and time constraints, but this situation should be resolved as soon as possible.

A member survey is planned for the first quarter of 2021, which will not only examine members’ responses to the new website, but also determine their meeting preferences in terms of frequency (e.g. several times a year) and form (face-to-face and/or online). The next online meeting is already planned for January 2021.
