## Abstract

With the publication in 2020 of the fifth edition of the Society of Indexers’ training course, the current Training Director traces the development of training in the Society of Indexers (SI) since its foundation in 1957. From lectures held in London, through a paper-based course relying on the postal service, to a modern online course using digital technology to deliver a more immediate and personalized experience, indexing training has been through many transformations. Throughout, an emphasis on rigour and the maintenance of standards has been paramount.

## Introduction

The Society of Indexers (SI) course, ‘Training in Indexing’, entered a new phase in July 2020 with the launch of its fifth edition. The four course modules have been revised and updated, but the main change has been to course delivery. Feedback over the years had always been very positive, the course being described in 2015 as ‘a solid foundation for a career in indexing’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> However, a constant request was for more personal tuition. The new course addresses this in two ways. After passing the initial test following Module A, students are assigned a personal course adviser to support their learning until they apply for their final (Module D) test. And the formal tests for Modules B and C have been replaced by non-assessed indexing assignments with individual feedback from a tutor. There is also an additional optional indexing assignment as a preparation for Test D, the theory section of which now covers what has been learned in Modules B, C and D. Students are also now required to work through all the exercises on the course website, which were previously optional. The final stage is still a non-assessed pre-qualification indexing assignment, creating an index to a full-length book of the candidate’s choice.

Training for a professional qualification such as SI Accreditation (AI) has to do two things: to provide students with the knowledge and skills to do the job professionally, and to have a rigorous testing system in place so that only those who demonstrate that they are ready to index in the commercial world will be awarded the qualification. With the aim of fulfilling both functions, the SI training course first appeared in 1988. The original authors would have been amazed by some of the elements of the course today, such as fully electronic delivery, an interactive website, and training in embedded indexing. But today’s course is the culmination of a long history of training in the Society of Indexers, dating back almost to its foundation in 1957. This article aims to explore this history, and to trace the development of the ‘Training in Indexing’ course since 1988.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup>

## Early years

Prior to the establishment of the Society of Indexers in 1957, indexers were largely self-taught, learning on the job or through various instructive books such as that by [Robert Collison (1953)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R10), one of SI’s founder members, or perhaps even [Wheatley (1902)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R26). The only indexing training appears to have been that provided by Nancie Bailey and Mary Petherbridge in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (see [Bell, 2008](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R1): 87–8, 93–7).

When the Society of Indexers was set up, the first of its five stated objectives was ‘to improve the standard of indexing and to secure some measure of uniformity in technique’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup> The first training course, a series of six evening lectures, was held in 1958, and similar courses were held regularly in SI’s early years, nine courses in all between 1958 and 1971 ([Harrod, 1972](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R18)). In 1966 the format changed from evening sessions held at weekly intervals to more intensive courses held over successive days, and in 1971 there were separate courses for beginners and more experienced indexers. All these courses except the first were held at the School of Librarianship at the North-Western Polytechnic, London, where L. M. Harrod was a lecturer in librarianship. Leonard Montague (Monty) Harrod (1905–84), ‘somewhat strait-laced and Victorian’, according to [Elizabeth Wallis (2007](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R25): 230), was the author of _Harrod’s librarians’ glossary and reference book_, now in its tenth edition; a founder member of SI, he edited _The Indexer_ from 1964 to 1978 and was closely involved with the early training courses. In 1972 he wrote,

> Some people may maintain that indexing cannot be taught. This is not so; one must have a natural aptitude for the work, but this is not all that is necessary, neither does it deny that the skills of a book-indexer can be taught. Indexing can be taught in a class, but the opportunity to carry out practical exercises is essential and this is why there has been more emphasis at the courses on practice, although there has still not been enough concentration on this, which is, after all, the fundamental aspect of the indexer’s craft. ([Harrod, 1972](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R18): 51)

## The first correspondence courses

In 1971 the SI Council floated the idea of a correspondence course as a better means of indexing training, incorporating indexing assignments which students could do at their own speed and at a time that suited them. The basic components of indexing training, as set out by Harrod in 1972, resonate well today: ‘Working on texts to determine the choice of words and forms of headings, the problems of foreign personal names, the determination of subject headings, the arrangement of entries and sub-entries, the presentation of printed indexes and the mechanics of indexing’ ([Harrod, 1972](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R18): 51–2).

Harrod also foresaw the possibility of SI becoming an examining body for indexing, setting out principles which are still upheld:

> If it does, it should aim at the highest possible standard of qualification – one that will be held in as high esteem as that of any other professional organization with a sense of responsibility for qualifying people to undertake a function with the highest possible skill. The standard of examination should be stiff – and it should be known to be so; no persons should be given a qualification without it being known that they are really competent, and no personal consideration of any kind should be allowed to influence admission to a qualification. ([Harrod, 1972](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R18): 52–3)

### The Rapid Results course

For its first correspondence course SI teamed up with the Rapid Results College ([Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#F1)), established in 1928 to provide high-quality professional training and still in existence today.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup> The RRC course was launched in 1973 and new enrolments in the early years were over a hundred a year ([Gordon, 1981](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R13)). The plan was for successful completion of the course to lead on seamlessly to Registration by SI.

Jill Halliday signed up for the course after hearing on the radio programme _Woman’s Hour_ what an interesting job indexing was, and how one ‘could do it sitting in an armchair’! Her tutor was Wing Commander Pemberton, and she remembered it as being ‘relatively simple and … not difficult to fit in, particularly as my first child was easy and slept enormous amounts. (My luck ran out after that!)’ ([Halliday, 2005](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R16): 174). Jonathan Burd ‘spent the long hot summer of 1976 sitting on a canal bank reading each of the lessons (about twelve of them) … then going home to do the test, posting it off to my personal tutor … I was instantly hooked and decided indexing was the career for me’ ([Burd and Kingdom, 2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R6): 11).

### Supervision and the BIPT course

From its foundation in 1957 SI had maintained a panel of competent and experienced indexers who could be recommended to clients. In 1968 this was replaced by the Register. To be eligible for inclusion, members had to submit examples of completed indexes for scrutiny by a board of assessors; past work experience, academic qualifications and other relevant matters were also taken into consideration ([Wallis, 1972](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R24)). Much later, the Registration system was replaced by Fellowship. While the RRC course was a good basic introduction to indexing, however, it was felt that it did not bring students up to the standard needed to join the Register.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup> To fill this gap a supervision scheme was set up in 1981 by Michael Gordon, SI training officer and a long-time RRC tutor; he was described in 1988, when he resigned from SI, as ‘a lively arguer over all aspects of indexing and SI administration … his pungent comments will be missed’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#fn6" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn6">6</a></sup> For the supervision scheme the candidate would index a substantial book under the direct supervision of a Registered indexer ([Gordon, 1981](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R13): 206). Ann Hall later took over from Michael Gordon and ran the scheme until 2002, when it was incorporated into the SI training course.

Ann Hall was already running a separate independent indexing course which had begun in 1983 and was also the brainchild of Michael Gordon, as a result of his concerns about the efficacy of the RRC course.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#fn7" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn7">7</a></sup> The course was Book Indexing Postal Tutorials (BIPT), later renamed Book Indexing Personal Tuition. Ann Hall ran it with great dedication and enthusiasm from 1984 until it was discontinued in 2009. The emphasis was on practical indexing rather than theory, and the course consisted of five tutorials for which students had to index progressively longer pieces of text. Students found the course down-to-earth and approachable and appreciated having a single named tutor ([Hall, 1997](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R14); 2002). Several of the most eminent British indexers of recent years (including Wheatley Medal winner Barbara Hird) are BIPT-trained. Jane Horton chose the BIPT course in 1992 and ‘loved it from the start’ ([Horton and Howson, 2018](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R19)).

The BIPT course had some limitations, however. It covered only back-of-the-book indexing and lacked a rigorous testing structure; anyone who completed all the BIPT tutorials was deemed to have passed the course, whatever the standard of their indexing, though very poor students were advised to discontinue and others dropped out, as with any distance-learning course; the completion rate in 1997 was only 27 per cent.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#fn8" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn8">8</a></sup> Between 1985 and 1996 BIPT had nearly 800 enrolments, mostly from the UK but with a substantial number from overseas ([Hall, 2002](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R15)). On completion, students were encouraged to take part in the SI supervision scheme before ideally progressing to Registration. BIPT was recognized as a valid training course by SI for many years but there were concerns about both its lack of formal testing and its insufficient coverage of indexing theory.

## SI ‘Training in Indexing’ is launched

By the mid-1980s the RRC course had become out of date and the college asked SI to revise or replace it. Instead, in 1987 SI decided to set up its own distance-learning training course, leading to Accreditation. Unlike the BIPT course, the new course was to include guidance on journal indexing, database indexing, directory compilations and the creation of classifications and subject structures. The course was underpinned by the new British Standard BS 3700: 1988, _Preparing indexes to books, periodicals and other documents_.

There was a fair amount of opposition to the plans, particularly from older SI members, who felt the approach to be too clinical and theoretical. Their view of indexing as more of an art than a science is reflected in the title of the first SI president G. Norman Knight’s book _Indexing, the art of_ (1979). The writers of the new course were mostly from a library background and, even worse, were nearly all women, quite a contrast to the early days of SI, as described by Elizabeth Wallis: ‘I remember the overwhelming maleness of the Society’s officers … The men all seemed like elderly clubbable gentlemen to me, and so many freemasons among them’ ([Wallis, 2007](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R25): 229).

However, largely due to the hard work and enthusiasm of Janet Shuter, SI chair 1986–90, the new course went ahead ([Britton, 2007](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R4): 234).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#fn9" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn9">9</a></sup> Published in 1988–9 and written by a team comprising Ken Bakewell, Pat Booth, Mary Piggott and Elizabeth Wallis, the five course units were

Informal tests and exercises, with answers, were included so that students could assess their readiness for the formal tests.

Also covered were the use of personal computers and indexing software. SI had long been interested in the use of new technology: in 1981, although most indexers were then still compiling indexes on cards to be typed up at the final stage, a working party on technology was looking into the possible use of word processors and microcomputers as a tool for indexing. ‘Members will soon, we hope, be able to familiarize themselves with the techniques of technology-assisted indexing. Be prepared!’ ([Gordon, 1981](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R13): 206). In 1988 an additional optional course unit on computer-assisted indexing was being planned;<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#fn10" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn10">10</a></sup> this never reached fruition, but relevant information was progressively added to the course.

Apart from the business of indexing, later dropped from the course, and some material relating more to librarianship and cataloguing than to indexing (reflecting the background of the authors), much of the content of the first edition has survived the test of time and is still there in some form in the fifth edition. As [Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#F3) shows, some of the original wording from 1988 remains but the layout is now much clearer and more spacious, and examples have been added.

### Assessment: tests and marking

There was a test paper for each unit, with successful completion of all five tests leading to Accreditation. The marking process was completely anonymous, and candidates who failed a test could resit twice. In 1988 the price was set at £10 per module, with tutorial support at £7.50 an hour available as an optional extra.

The new course was committed to the principles of open learning. ‘We have separated manuals, tutorial support, and tests, so that people may learn in their own way and at their own pace.’<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#fn11" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn11">11</a></sup> This meant that students could take the tests in any order and could apply for a test without waiting for the result of the previous one. In addition, ‘Members interested in Accreditation who have completed RRC, BIPT, library school courses – or no training at all’ could take the tests without purchasing the course units;<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#fn12" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn12">12</a></sup> copies of the self-administered tests from each module were available separately. This flexibility did not prove to be in the interest of either the students or the Society, however, and the rules were later tightened up.

In 1990 Sarah Mitchell-Cameron was appointed Course Administrator and Barbara Britton Course Co-ordinator. The Course Administrator was the point of contact with students, sending out training materials and tests and allocating papers to markers. The Training Co-ordinator was responsible for recruiting markers and ensuring that they all marked to the same standard, supervising their marking of the first few papers for each level. Markers, who were paid at the basic indexing rate, were experienced indexers and, in the early years, Registered members of SI. Although accuracy of spelling, locators and so on was very important, a marker’s crucial task was to assess the candidate’s understanding of the principles of indexing, so although suggested solutions were provided to help, marking demanded good knowledge of the principles of indexing, plus empathy and teaching skills, as it does to this day.

Students achieving Accreditation were expected to progress seamlessly to Registration, but there was still concern about this in 1996 when the Registration Assessors complained about the standard of some indexers who had gained Accreditation but then failed the Registration process. It was concluded that the failures did not arise from the training-course materials, which covered the basics of indexing thoroughly, but that ‘overhelpful’ comments by markers on failed papers may sometimes have enabled borderline candidates to pass simply by attending to the particular faults mentioned while not recognizing the underlying principles involved. Markers would be warned about this. At that time, someone who failed would resit the same test and have it marked by the same marker; the obvious solution, having different test papers for resits, was not applied until some years later.

The new SI course quickly proved popular, with about 70 people successfully completing it by 1994.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#fn13" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn13">13</a></sup> The original course units soon needed revision, and an editorial board was set up under Pat Booth to prepare a second edition (Units A–E), which appeared unit by unit between 1990 and 2001.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#fn14" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn14">14</a></sup> From the start, the revision of the course materials has been driven by student needs; when some aspect of indexing is seen to cause particular problems, coverage has been clarified and, if necessary, expanded. By the end of 2002, 261 indexers had successfully completed the course. It was seen by some, however, as dull and boring, lacking in humour, pedantic and dry. Many found the BIPT course more congenial and it had a strong following, and when there were rumours in 1994 that it might cease functioning there was a flurry of protest in the _SI Newsletter_: ‘It seems a terrible idea that such a splendid, solid, practical indexer training course should be sacrificed at the altar of standardization.’<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#fn15" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn15">15</a></sup> The rumours were false, though, and the BIPT course continued, though the fact that it did not lead to a recognized SI qualification remained a disadvantage; Jane Horton, for example, decided to follow it up with the SI training course as she felt this would help her to get more work ([Horton and Howson, 2018](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R19)).

### Administrative developments and improvements

In the early days of the SI training course everything was done by post. Course units were A4 printed booklets, and information about the course was posted out on typescript sheets. Test papers were posted to candidates, who returned their answers as typescript; handwritten submissions were not allowed. Candidates were reminded by the Course Administrator to paper-clip their pages together and not to put them in a fancy folder to try to impress the markers. Papers were marked in pencil and posted in batches to the Training Course Co-ordinator, who had to store them until the candidate had completed the course. Marks and comments were posted by the marker to the Course Administrator, and the overall result and the marker’s comments were posted on to the candidate. Postage and stationery were major expenses, and one Course Co-ordinator was very grateful to live opposite a letterbox. From 2006, test papers were gradually made available in electronic format, and students were given the option of submitting their answers as email attachments.

Other important developments in the 1990s included annual markers’ meetings, held from 1994 and incorporating formal moderation of test questions from 1996. Also in 1996 a telephone helpline was introduced, whereby students could ask for clarification of anything in the course units (but not the test papers) which they did not understand; this continued until 2010, when it had been largely superseded by an email helpline, introduced in 2002, which still continues. For students able to travel to London and other venues there were still ‘live’ courses (now called workshops) for those at various levels of the training course. Participants welcomed the chance to meet other students and a tutor who was a practising indexer.

## Into the new millennium: the third edition and the CD-ROM

Major changes came in with the third edition of the course, published in 2002–3 ([Figure 4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#F4)). The five course units were reduced to four, the unit on information sources being regarded as less relevant in the digital age, though some of its content was incorporated into other units. An editorial board undertook the lengthy revision process and the final text was edited by Ann Kingdom, who introduced a more modern and informal style of presentation, with a more user-friendly layout incorporating figures, text boxes and marginal notes. According to the preface, ‘The intention is to offer an easier and more expansive introduction to indexing, at the request of many trainees … Throughout, more has been said about the use of computers in indexing, and there are many more examples to illustrate the application of indexing theory.’<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#fn16" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn16">16</a></sup> The new international standard on indexing, BS ISO 999: 1996, _Information and documentation: guidelines for the content, organization and presentation of indexes_ was now the basis for much of the course teaching. Another major innovation was a CD-ROM which contained new interactive exercises, prepared by Merrall-Ross International Limited, in addition to the full text of the course units. At the time this was seen as cutting-edge technology. Students could buy the course in hard copy plus the CD-ROM, or just the CD-ROM, which was cheaper; most opted for the former.

Rohan Bolton took the course between 2003 and 2005 and kept a diary of her progress. ‘The day the first unit arrives in the post I can’t wait to open the package and see what I’ve let myself in for. At a first glance it looks pretty logical and straightforward … With hindsight the phrase “pride comes before a fall” comes to mind!’ ([Bolton, 2005](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R3): 175).

### Assessment improvements

Some tightening up of the marking system now took place. In 2004 a resit paper with parallel questions was written for each test, to be marked by a different marker, and eventually a third set of alternative papers was produced for the later tests, to allow for students who had already failed twice. From 2003 students had to pass each test before applying for the next. In 2006, in the interests of bringing testing procedures in line with current standards, the annual markers’ meeting included sessions by an outside speaker with relevant expertise, and this was repeated in later years; in 2008 the speaker was a former chief examiner for A-level and GCSE boards who also had experience of Open University examining ([Halliday, 2008](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R17)). From 2006 there were also additional moderation sessions by email (later by Skype and Zoom).

The fact that there is no one correct way to index any piece of text makes marking test papers a complex process, demanding knowledge and experience on the part of the markers. Some of the more mechanical questions from the earlier tests were gradually superseded, particularly those which required accurate copying – irrelevant once papers were supplied in electronic format and cutting and pasting became possible. At the same time, marking schemes were refined, with marks broken down under different categories, to make marking more consistent.

To learn to index well, practice on real texts is essential; this was one area where the BIPT course outdid the early versions of the SI course. Every text is different, and indexers learn something new with each index they make. The formal tests have gradually changed to include more indexing of real texts of different kinds, with the length of the texts gradually increasing as students progress through the course. In the early editions of the course, tests simply required students to index a section of the relevant course unit. A separate booklet, specially written by Pat Booth, was later added as an additional indexing task for Test A, and a newspaper letters page for Test B. Students could originally choose their own letters page, but this caused problems for marking consistency, and some tried to impress by picking _The Times_ or _The Guardian_, while others realized that using the _Daily Mail_ or the _Radio Times_ would be much easier! Eventually students were instead given a standard letters page (especially written for the tests). For Test C a published booklet of around 40 pages provided a more advanced indexing task. For Test D the indexing task has from an early stage been making an index to all the course units. Meanwhile, other questions testing students’ skill at term selection and wording of headings were introduced.

Some of the original questions still remain, however; for example, for Test A many generations of indexing students have had to index a list of poems by author, title and first line and to pick out non-preferred terms, cross-references and so on from a short list of index entries.

## Further developments in the 2000s

Passing the formal tests does not in itself fit students to launch themselves into the commercial world, but although they were encouraged to do a supervision at the end of the course, not all students took this up. So in 2002 the SI supervision scheme was incorporated into the course as a compulsory ‘Practical Indexing Assignment’. Students are free to choose any book without an index and of a suitable length and complexity, and they receive constructive comments from a named adviser.

To encourage contact among students, a student online discussion list, SI-Trainee, was set up in 2004. Now a forum (SI-Student) on the SI website, this is accessible only to students, with a moderator who is not involved in the training course keeping an eye on posts to make sure students are not exchanging tips about passing tests.

A major innovation in 2007 was the introduction of group online tutorials, where a group of up to ten students compile indexes to a set text and then compare and discuss their results under the guidance of an experienced indexer. The tutorials run through email for a month, with two weeks to compile the index and two weeks of guided discussion with the tutor and the other participants. In contrast to the formal tests, where indexes need to be as perfect as possible with minimal errors in transcription, layout and so on, the tutorials give an opportunity to ‘have a go’ at a text without the stress of having to produce a polished index. After the two weeks of discussion most students are dissatisfied with their original versions but have learned a great deal. Students are required to take at least three tutorials. As well as providing more practice, they give personal contact with other students and with an experienced working indexer.

Some students demurred at the gradual addition of new compulsory elements to the course, adding to the cost, but take-up when they were optional had been low. Once people had to take them they realized how valuable they were, with the online tutorials quickly becoming one of the most popular parts of the course. In a 2009 survey, 55 per cent of respondents felt the course to be good value for money and 36 per cent rated it average; only 9 per cent thought it overly expensive. As many as 72 per cent would definitely recommend the course to someone considering a career in indexing.

The flexibility of the course has always been much appreciated by students, who were often fitting it in alongside other commitments: Liz Fawcett wrote in 2008, ‘It is very difficult to estimate how long each module will take, especially when domestic or work-related problems intrude; a recent house move caused me to have to withdraw from an online tutorial as I was without internet access for two weeks’ ([Fawcett, 2008](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R12): 11). Helen Bilton began the course while on maternity leave and took another long break after passing Test C to have another baby. By the end of the course she was ‘100% sure about \[indexing\] and ready to start real work, excited but nervous … I couldn’t have set myself up in business without it!’ ([Bilton, 2008](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R2): 11).

By 2010, 358 people had completed the course and gained Accreditation, and since 2002 the Betty Moys Prize has been presented to the best newly Accredited indexer each year. Betty Moys MBE, distinguished indexer and formerly the SI honorary treasurer, left a legacy to the Society to provide for this, funding a cash award for the first ten years; the winner now receives a year’s free SI membership.

On several occasions, indexing, and the SI training course, have been featured in women’s magazines as an easy way of making money working from home; in 2003 _Eve_ magazine featured it under the heading ‘Work less, pay more’. As well as bringing in some excellent indexers who would otherwise never have come across indexing, this has sometimes encouraged people without a suitable educational background to embark on the course and inevitably fall by the wayside at an early stage. To avoid this, in 2004 a pre-enrolment questionnaire, devised by Pat Booth, was introduced for potential students to gauge their aptitude for indexing. A revised version is still on the SI website.

In 2008 SI gained the CILIP Seal of Approval from the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals, in recognition of its training course and workshops. This was a boost to the reputation of the course, and helped in marketing it to library professionals, traditionally a major source of new indexers. The relationship with CILIP has been maintained; although the Seal of Approval scheme has been discontinued, SI is now a CILIP Supplier Partner.

### Around the world

From 2007 members of other indexing societies affiliated through the International Committee of Representatives of Indexing Societies (ICRIS) were eligible to take the SI training course, receiving not Accreditation but a certificate of completion. Take-up was slow at first, but over the years there have been several students from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. One of these was Glenys Daley from New Zealand, who wrote that she was ‘really glad that I did the UK Society of Indexers training course’. She welcomed the flexible approach and the system of paying for each section separately, and

> felt supported and encouraged by SI staff, and any queries were responded to quickly, despite the fact that the Society is based in the UK and I am on the other side of the world … Having done various university distance-learning courses – and created some myself – I was impressed by this course. It is well structured, thorough and professional. ([Daley, 2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R11): 8–9)

In 2006 the American Society of Indexers (ASI, now the American Society for Indexing) set up its own training course, using training materials licensed from SI but with its own testing system. This arrangement is currently (2020) still active. Other societies run their own training schemes ([Browne, 2010](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R5)): the Australian and New Zealand Society of Indexers (ANZSI) runs an accreditation scheme ([Quinn, 2015](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R21)), and the Indexing Society of Canada/Société canadienne d’indexation (ISC/SCI) a mentoring programme ([Ullstrom, 2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R23); [Christian, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R7)). In 2004 Sylvia Coates launched the University of California–Berkeley Extension course on ‘Indexing: Theory and Application’, which continues to run successfully, with students mainly from the US but also from all over the world, particularly from Canada and Australia. It is a more intensive course than SI’s, requiring completion in six months ([Coates, 2005](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R8); [Coates et al., 2011](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#core-R9)).

## Into the cloud: an Internet-based course

Major changes to the SI course took place with the appearance of the fourth edition in 2010. The text of the course units (now renamed modules) was revised by five members of the Training Course Committee, updating material to reflect changes in publishing and indexing; the old section on the business of indexing was dropped, as it quickly became out of date and information on running a small business was easily available elsewhere.

The British Standards on which the course was always based, in particular BS ISO 999: 1996: _Information and documentation: guidelines for the content, organization and presentation of indexes_, had never been revised and were now hard to find in libraries and expensive to buy. Instead of requiring students to refer to the standards, therefore, their main points were incorporated into the course modules.

The most important innovation, however, was the introduction of a linked website ([Figure 5](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#F5)), run by Nelson Croom, a firm specializing in providing training packages for professional organizations.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#fn17" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn17">17</a></sup> The old practice tests and the interactive exercises from the CD-ROM were transferred to the website, and new ones added. The course modules were no longer printed, but were downloadable from the website, either complete or by section as required. ([Figure 6](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.37#F6))

An additional feature of the website was a useful resource centre, which included some texts of various lengths on which students could practise their indexing and then compare their index with one by an experienced indexer. With all test papers now submitted electronically, the course was entirely Internet-based. In 2014 Module A was further revised to set the practice of indexing within the context of e-publishing, and in 2016 a new section on ebooks, written by Glenda Browne of ANZSI, was added to Module D.

The new edition of the course was much appreciated by the students (now formally called ‘students’ rather than ‘trainees’). Those responding to feedback surveys in 2015 and 2019 described the course as a ‘thorough guide to indexing good practice’, a ‘stimulating, rewarding time of study’, and ‘\[o\]ne of the best examples of distance learning that I’ve encountered’.

### Marking and assessment

Maintaining consistent standards was a continuing concern. Since 2010, when SI introduced a professional grading scheme, Accredited indexers have been designated Professional Members of SI, with a listing in the online directory. So it was even more essential that testing should be fair and consistent. Marker training became ever more rigorous, and regular moderation sessions were continued, with one live meeting and one or more email or Skype moderation sessions per year. Second opinions were required on borderline papers. Students who failed a paper twice (for Module A) or three times (for Modules B–D) had long been disqualified from the course, but an option whereby disqualified students could restart the course from the beginning after an interval was discontinued in 2013.

From 2010 each test paper was split into two parts – theory and practice. Candidates now had to pass both parts, thus closing a loophole whereby someone could pass a test with a poor score on the practical indexing question as long as they could master the more mechanical indexing skills and transcribe accurately.

Although flexibility has always been one of the main selling points of the course, it became apparent that students tended to lose momentum if they left long gaps between the various modules; the original five-year time limit was reduced to four in 2012, with the possibility of applying for an extension in extenuating circumstances.

Candidates have always received comments on their test papers, whether pass or fail. In the early days these comments could be quite short, just a paragraph or two, but over the years they have become longer, and can now run to five or six A4 pages on the later tests. As well as pointing out errors, markers give constructive criticism to guide the students on how to prepare for a resit (if necessary) or a future paper. The comments are much appreciated by students, but are time-consuming to prepare, and markers are practising indexers taking time away from their indexing work. Markers’ fees have therefore gradually had to rise (though still paid at the SI basic hourly rate), with a consequent impact on student fees; however, the course is still generally considered good value for money. A marker support system was introduced in 2010, giving markers regular opportunities to assess their progress and raise any problems with the Training Course Co-ordinator.

There was much discussion in 2007 about whether some marking could be done electronically, without human input, but it was concluded that few questions were mechanical enough to make this feasible.

In recent years, in line with developments in education generally, students have been more proactive in expecting value for money and challenging what they perceive as unfair treatment. Markers are trained to give constructive criticism without causing offence. No marker in 2020 would make a comment as brusque as this one from 1997:

> Although you appear to understand the theory behind indexing, you must consider whether you feel you have the patience or ability to reach the standards of thoroughness and attention to detail that indexing demands. If you decide to resit make sure you check your answer paper more carefully than you did this one!

The quality of feedback, both in tutorials and in test comments, is much appreciated by current students.

SI has become increasingly concerned about the number of people outside the Society working professionally as indexers. To encourage very experienced indexers to join SI and get qualified, an Experience Route to Accreditation was introduced in 2016. Candidates have to study the course modules, show evidence of their indexing experience, and then pass a test which is comparable to the final test of the full training course.

### Online workshops

The ‘live’ workshops which had flourished in previous years as an adjunct to the course now became unviable. Student numbers have fallen, in parallel with a gradual decline in Society membership which has affected all indexing societies worldwide. And with the increasing availability of online training, people are less keen to travel to ‘live’ workshops. The ‘Introduction to Indexing’ workshop, aimed at people thinking about taking up indexing or just starting on the course, was replaced in 2016 by an online workshop devised by Jan Worrall, ‘Indexing Basics’, which has had good take-up. With electronic indexing methods becoming more in demand, an online workshop on embedded indexing was introduced in 2015 and later became a compulsory element of the course. Meanwhile, online workshops on ‘How to Edit an Index’ and ‘Writing Index Entries’, tutored by Ann Hudson, were launched in 2013 and 2014 respectively, catering for students as well as experienced indexers.

### Humanizing the course

The marking system is still completely anonymous; each student has a number which is known only to the Course Administrator. A marker therefore knows nothing about the student whose paper they are marking. Are they old or young, male or female, aiming for a full-time indexing career or a part-time job, perhaps after retirement? Are they currently working full-time or have they been made redundant? Do they have small children and are they looking for work they can do from home when the children start school – a traditional route into indexing? Have they come from a librarianship background or from some other area, such as teaching, academia or IT?

The introduction of the group online tutorials began to break these barriers down: students were invited to introduce themselves and tutors gained a good picture of the current spectrum of indexing students which they could pass on to others involved in training, although the anonymity of the marking process was of course carefully preserved. The greater opportunities to meet other students, even though mostly online, are much appreciated, as indexing training can be quite a lonely experience, although as most indexers work alone at home this is good preparation for the future.

Another innovation, in 2011, was a student representative, to act as a channel between students and the Training Course Committee which manages the course. The student representative is elected by the students and uses the SI-Student forum to canvass opinion. Matters of concern raised by individual students or arising from discussions on the forum can be passed to the Training Course Committee.

A one-to-one online tutorial to help those who had failed the final test was introduced in 2012, and another for those who failed an earlier test in 2014. And to help smooth out progression through the course, an extra practice exercise for Module C was introduced in 2017. Both these receive personal feedback from the tutor.

With the withdrawal from the course of information on setting up in business, newly Accredited indexers needed some help in getting started. Partly to address this, an online forum, ‘New Professionals’, was set up in 2013, with a selection of experienced indexers acting as advisers. New AIs could also ask about problems with their early indexing commissions, and the forum has proved very valuable.

By 2020, as has been shown, there were a number of additional elements to the course apart from the modules and the tests, all helping to make the student experience less impersonal. Meanwhile, lower student numbers have made a complex structure of formal tests more difficult to sustain. The structural changes brought in with the fifth edition in 2020, with the introduction of course advisers and the replacement of two of the formal tests by tutored indexing exercises, are aimed at improving the student experience and making the course more sustainable for years to come.

## Finally …

The evolution of SI training has been long and complex, but has benefited greatly from continuity in those involved. The Training and Research Board (later Training and Qualifications Board) was set up in 1985 and chaired by Elizabeth Wallis, the SI Registrar, from the start until 1997; Connie Tyler, Barbara Hird and Valerie Elliston subsequently chaired the Board until it was disbanded in 2002. Its successor, the Training Course Committee, set up in 2002, has had only three chairs: Ann Hudson (2002–3 and 2014–date), Jill Halliday (2004–9) and Jan Worrall (2009–14). There have been only three Training Course Co-ordinators: Barbara Britton (1990–2001), Ann Hudson (2001–13) and Jan Worrall (2013–date). SI’s office manager, Paul Machen, has been Training Course Administrator since 2006; his three predecessors were Wendy Burrow, Sue King and Sarah Mitchell-Cameron. Several tutors for online tutorials and test-paper markers have served for more than ten years.

Although the SI training course has continued to develop over the years in response to student needs and changes in the publishing industry, much has survived from the first edition of the course units. Those of us who have been involved in running the course in recent years owe much to our predecessors. We now have a training course well fitted to the needs of the twenty-first century. Long may it continue to evolve!
