## Abstract

Pilar Wyman reports on the work of the US National Information Standards Organization (NISO) Criteria for Indexes project, which aims to revise and extend the NISO TR02-1997 _Guidelines for indexes and related information retrieval devices_. The guidelines have not been reviewed since 1984 and will thus be updated to address modern indexing techniques.

As described in this journal in the spring of 2019 by Marti Heyman and Heather Hedden ([2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.9#core-R1)), a new US National Information Standards Organization (NISO) project on indexing standards is under way. The goal of the NISO Criteria for Indexes project is to review, revise and extend as needed NISO TR02-1997 _Guidelines for indexes and related information retrieval devices_ (which was based on Z39.4-1984, _Basic criteria for indexes_). This NISO TR02-1997 technical report is out of date and does not address modern indexing techniques.

The projects aims to address issues of currency and completeness of coverage, and to enable NISO voting members to consider designation of the final work product as a formal standard for indexes.

## Current timeline

In September 2019, the Criteria for Indexes Working Group was approved and in October the initial work plan was approved. In addition to NISO staff, the working group includes 16 members, from several American library associations, libraries, commercial database vendors, publishers, and the American Society for Indexing. The members are physically located all over the United States and include database and taxonomy managers, directors and analysts of metadata, librarians, content managers, information specialists, reference librarians and indexers.

The original work plan general timeline anticipated completing a first draft for public comment in June 2020. The work has taken a few more months than anticipated: five, to be precise. Once the draft is finalized by the NISO editorial office, it will be released for a public comment period. After this closes, most likely early in 2021, the working group will reconvene to implement final revisions and approve a complete final draft of the proposed new standard. It will then submit the proposed new standard to the sponsoring NISO Topic Committee (Information Creation and Curation) for its approval.

After approval from the NISO Topic Committee, the proposed new standard will be put to a vote by NISO voting members for approval and submission to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Once ANSI has approved the new standard, NISO will be able to publish it as a formal standard available for use.

## Work in progress

Before work could begin, I ran OCR text recognition on the PDF file copy we had of the 1997 technical report, and the NISO editorial office built a Word version of the document for the group to work on. We worked iteratively and in phases. All group and subgroup meetings have been virtual.

First, we worked in conceptual subgroups based on types of index and indexing: open indexing, closed indexing, algorithmic indexing. Each conceptual subgroup has five members. ‘Open indexing’ corresponds to database and continuing indexing projects, while ‘closed indexing’ corresponds to book and back-of-the-book-style indexing, which most freelance indexers and other members of indexing societies do. ‘Algorithmic indexing’ corresponds to semi-automated indexing, as done with computer algorithms and often seen in indexes for large journal collections and other ongoing work. There is overlap between these types of indexing, particularly between open and algorithmic indexing. The algorithmic subgroup, originally referred to as the automatic subgroup, also drafted new content to be subsumed into the rest of the standard.

Then we worked in section subgroups based on the sections of the 1997 technical report:

Each of the section subgroups has three or four members. These section subgroups include representatives from each of the conceptual subgroups. Each section subgroup corresponds to the original sections of the technical report (NISO TR02-1997) that is being updated and converted into a standard. ‘Headings and locators’ used to be called ‘Headings and search arrays’, but that group recommended changing the name. Similarly, the ‘References/Bibliography’ subgroup created content for sections now called ‘Informative references and bibliography’. (Per NISO standards templates, there is also a section called ‘Normative references’, including references culled from the Bibliography.)

We also formed an editorial subgroup, which also includes representatives from each of the conceptual subgroups. One member is on two conceptual subgroups. Most members are on multiple section subgroups, though nobody is on more than three.

In the first round of work, the conceptual subgroups focused on identifying outdated information and gaps, and on flagging content which might not belong in a formal standard. We worked in Google Docs and Word, and placed queries and comments in the text.

After the first round of conceptual macro review, the section subgroups got to work. They responded to the comments from the conceptual groups and updated or added content, including the material from the algorithmic group. Each section subgroup submitted a new draft of their section. The editorial subgroup then merged the new section drafts into a fresh ‘working document’ for the next round of review by the conceptual subgroups.

During the third round of work, the open, closed and algorithmic groups reconvened and reviewed the drafts from the section subgroups. They reviewed the recommendations from the section groups, responded to queries, and prepared a new draft of the entire document for the section groups to review. In response to the unanimous finding that much of the original content was explanatory and educative rather than prescriptive and succinct, the closed group also did a comprehensive edit for readability and sense. By the end of round five, each section subgroup had reconvened and produced a final version of their section that incorporated input from the conceptual subgroups.

One of the ASI-member indexers in the working group has prepared a comprehensive draft index with section numbers as locators. This index will be released with the draft of the standard when it goes out to public review. (While the standard is out for review, or once I have a final copy, I will also embed the index so that the final electronic edition can be hyperlinked and interactive.)

Indeed, we plan to create a new standard for indexes that will be current, and will address different indexing techniques, as well as indexes designed for electronic searching. This will be the first such standard for indexes and indexing in the United States since 1984. The work has been challenging and collaborative. In addition to the self-identified general topics of the sections, we have also considered specific issues of accessibility, metadata, bias, electronic display, non-display, hyperlinked locators and more. Finding consensus and then a common language satisfactory to _all_ indexers and indexes, regardless of their topic, speciality or medium, or whether they work in closed or ongoing systems, is a fascinating intellectual exercise. (All this, during a pandemic, no less.)
