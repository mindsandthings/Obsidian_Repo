Sandra Muchekeza was born and raised in Kenya before moving to Australia for her bachelor studies in psychology. After completing her studies, she joined her family in Toronto, Canada, where she started a career in project management in the not-for-profit sector. She developed a keen interest in diversity, equality and inclusion and works hard to ensure the voices of the marginalized are heard.

Sandra is currently the executive director at the Council of Canadians of African and Caribbean Heritage (CCACH), based in Edmonton, Alberta. CCACH supports activities that enhance the social, economic and educational life of African and Caribbean heritage communities in Edmonton. Passionate about the rights of women in every aspect of their lives, Sandra sits on the board of YWCA Edmonton, an organization that fights for the right to equal economic opportunities for women and girls and works towards ending gender-based violence.

Sandra loves the world of books so it is hardly a surprise that she and her sister founded a children’s books publishing company, Asili Kids, which produces and distributes books which have content and characters that children of African heritage can identify with and introduces children from all over the world to African stories.

Married with two young boys, Sandra loves spending quality time with her family, dabbling with photography, trying out new food recipes and, of course, reading.

## About the award

Since 2014, when the hashtag #weneeddiversebooks appeared, the Canadian publishing industry has slowly been waking up both to the lack of diverse voices and to the demand for them. With this bursary, ISC/SCI aims to help achieve equality of opportunity for aspiring indexers belonging to underrepresented and/or marginalized groups. The bursary covers fees for an approved indexing program, two years of ISC membership with listing, and entry into the Mary Newberry mentorship program. Full details of the application process are on the ISC/CSI website ([https://indexers.ca/tide-application/](https://indexers.ca/tide-application/)).
