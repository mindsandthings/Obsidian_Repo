## Abstract

Bibliometrics and quantitative analysis were used to analyse the characteristics of China’s index compilation and index research in the beginning of the twenty-first century. First, this article explains the origin and expected goals of index compilation and research proposals in this new century, and gives an account of data sources and the selection process. This is followed by a detailed statistical analysis of current index compilation and achievements in the new century. The author believes that the number of back-of-book indexes in China has increased and that their quality has generally improved. The compilation and summary of indexed books for independent publications have been outstanding. The number of indexed works published has been insufficient for more than a decade. In aspects like indexing type, the index object literature, the subject content reflected by the index, and the distribution of index compilers and index-publishing units, they have formed their own characteristics. In terms of index research, it is pointed out that _China Index_ as the first platform for index research has contributed to the development of China’s indexing industry. The research papers published in _China Index_ and in non-index journals were analysed in terms of the number and characteristics of the publications, the presentation of high-frequency words and semantic network diagrams, research topic cluster analysis, the authors’ statistics and the formation of core authors. Finally, representative figures and indexed works of Chinese indexing and research are summarized.

## Introduction

Time flies, and in the blink of an eye almost two decades of the twenty-first century have elapsed. With the approach of the Seventh World Index Summit in 2018, as in 2011, in order to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the establishment of the China Society of Indexers, a series of research papers was published, summarizing and analysing the achievements of Chinese index compilation. Research in the new century and exploring the development of index compilation have also been put on the agenda.

After more than half a year of material accumulation, and after searching, summarizing and screening index research papers in the new century, the author also focused on reading and analysing several summary and review index research papers. An unexpected finding was that although some research methods are correct and advanced (such as co-word clustering analysis and Lotka’s law<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup>), using modern advanced research tools (such as strategic coordinates, SPSS18.0, PAJEK software), the conclusions reached are very debatable.

For example, a paper using the academic journal online publication database of the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) as the data source, sets the search term as ‘index’, but uses only article titles and keywords to implement the search. Using this method, the total number of research papers on indexing in China from 1991 to 2010 was 28,805. After filtering out conference notices, conference reports, solicitation notices, etc., there were 11,498 articles on index research. The numbers seem to be very impressive, but they are unlikely to be in line with reality. The present author led the research team to identify index-profession papers by comprehensively searching and browsing the full text, and only obtained hundreds of articles on China’s index research from 2000 to 2017. In the 20 years from 1991 to 2010 (including 10 years in common), how, then, can the number of index research papers reach five digits? How can the number rise by more than ten times?

There is also a paper on the numerical analysis of the authors of index research papers in China (Qiu and Lou, [2012](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#core-R5)). It is believed that the authors of the index papers in the 1991–2010 period are in line with Lotka’s law and have formed a core author group. According to the statistics of the high-frequency authors of each year from 1991 to 2010, in addition to Zhang Qiyu, Hou Hanqing, Wang Yanxiang, Qiu Junping, Ping Baoxing, Wang Yage and the six outstanding index leaders, the remaining 80 high-frequency authors are not members of the China Society of Indexers. We do not know what they are studying and what results they have published. We can only say that these studies are not research into and the results of the indexing of literature. This also stimulated the author to carry out a new investigation of index compilation and the research situation in China since the beginning of the twenty-first century, through full-text browsing, judgement confirmation and data analysis of the index research results in a scientific, rigorous and serious manner, in order to draw conclusions that are consistent with the actual situation.

Several points should be noted about the issues discussed in this article. First of all, the author led the research team to search and summarize the indexed publications officially published in mainland China since the year 2000, and compare the _China Index Summary Sequel_ and the _China Index System Yearbook: 1999–2016_ by Mr Ping Baoxing, with the addendum and collation. The number of indexed works published in mainland China from 2000 to 2017 was 587, an insignificant number compared to the publication of more than 300,000 works of different kinds in China each year, and it is necessary to say something about this.

Second, _China Index_ is the only professional indexing journal in China (now a collection). Since its first publication in 2003, it has played an important role in promoting index research and information exchange in China. With the strong support of Mr Wen Guoqiang, the editorial director, the author obtained all the literature data published up to the third issue of 2017. Compared with the index research papers published in other journals, _China Index_ is obviously superior in the number of papers published. What are the characteristics of the index-professional questions discussed in these papers? What role has it played in promoting China’s indexing business? This naturally becomes a key issue to be explored here.

Third, through the continuous construction of the China Publishing Information Full-Text Database in recent years, we have accumulated 100,000 full-text, professional-level papers, including the full text of index research published in editorial and publishing academic journals. Through network search, manual search and other means, we also obtained nearly all the index research papers published in non-editing and non-publishing journals. The total number of index research papers outside _China Index_ from the year 2000 to 2017 is 323. What problems have these papers discussed? The new achievements and progress that have been made are also among the issues to be investigated and summarized here.

Fourth, with the development of computer technology, network technology, and big-data technology since the early 2000s, China’s index compilation technology research is not bad. From the specific types of index compilation techniques and rules summary to the development of indexing software, and then to the development of national indexing standards, there is a need for systematic summary. Since these studies are rarely reflected in research papers, it is necessary to obtain first-hand information in the indexing world in order to analyse the substance. In recent years, the author has developed the ‘Index Star’ software, participated in the work of the China Society of Indexers and formulated national indexing standards. This work has provided strong support for the mining of index technology development and other unpopular issues, with the aim of providing valuable information for readers.

Fifth, more scholars are paying attention to index research, but not enough attention is given to index compilation. Searching the index research papers published since the beginning of the twenty-first century, it is found that papers on statistics, investigation and analysis of the current status of index compilation are rare. There is no paper that summarizes research on domestic index compilation and points out achievements and shortcomings. To make up for the lack of research in this area, to take stock of the true status of China’s index compilation, and to point towards its future development, are also among the main goals of this paper.

The following sections analyse index compilation and research in China from the year 2000 to 2017. I sincerely hope to consult experts in the indexing industry.

## Index compilation: analysis of dynamics and achievements

Indexes are generally presented in three ways:

•

as an independently published work

•

attached to the indexed work, published as an integral part of the work, referred to as the post-volume index or back-of-book index

•

as a smaller index compilation, with the full text published in the journal or book.

In China’s current environment, back-of-book indexes are the largest category. It is difficult to count them; independently published indexed works are the smallest category, but the most obvious display.

## Back-of-book index quality and quantity

Since the beginning of the new century, the number of back-of-book indexes in China has increased significantly, and the quality has continued to improve. The reason for this is mainly the emphasis on index compilation by management at all levels of the country and the further regulation of the publication of academic works. For example, the deputy director of the former General Administration of Press Publication, Wu Shulin, participated in the publication meeting of the _Chinese Library: Fifth Series_ in Beijing in January 2012. He pointed out that the proportion of academic works published before Liberation was 23–32 per cent, and the UN average was around 28 per cent. Before the 1960s, more than 10 per cent of academic works in China were indexed; the figure is now less than 3 per cent (Wu, 2012).

Wu Shulin emphasized that published academic works must have strict specifications and basic publishing standards, and that basic elements such as indexes, notes, keywords, and references should be improved. It is necessary to introduce such complicated details to facilitate reading and academic communication. He also pointed out that the General Administration of Press and Publication will soon issue a document on standards and requirements for the publication of academic works, making it clear that books that do not meet academic standards and norms will not in future have access to publishing funds and cannot participate in publishing awards. They will also be excluded from the selection of important publications (Wu, [2012](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#core-R7)).

This kind of emphasis and requirement is necessary and it is easier to implement in China. The government’s publishing authorities and supervisors soon began to emphasize academic norms in various domestic publications, including indexing; otherwise qualifications will be cancelled or points will be deducted. For example, the author participated in the National Yearbook Compilation Quality Evaluation organized by the Yearbook Working Committee of the Publishers Association of of China for many years. It was clearly stipulated that if the index of the participating yearbook was not compiled, five points would be deducted from the yearbook. This deduction means that the participating yearbook would be excluded from the competition for the special prize and the first prize. This has led to most participating yearbooks having back-of-book indexes, which objectively promotes the standardization of yearbook compilation.

Similar to the practice of the yearbook community, China’s new local history also attaches great importance to the compilation of back-of-book indexes. The Chinese Local Records Steering Group issued the Regional Chronicle Quality Regulations in October 2008, which is stated in Article 11 of Chapter 3, ‘Genre’. The local chronicles include ‘report, record, chronicle, biography, photo, table, contents and index’. This is the first time in the history of Chinese book compilation that ‘index’ has been explicitly included. This measure has greatly promoted index compilation in new local chronicles. At present, there are more and more indexes in the new records being compiled and edited, and the quality is getting better and better. In the third round (2020) of the national new local-history project, the Chinese Local Records Steering Group will also introduce new regulations, including one stating that the new local history must include a back-of-book index, which means that the new local chronicles will in future be indexed. What was once an optional item has become a ‘must-have project’.

In recent years, book publishing units have also begun to pay attention to the issue of the indexing of academic books, and many publishers have also issued relevant rules and safeguards. For example, the Beijing Institute of Technology Press stipulates that for key academic works, it is necessary for the responsible editor to take the lead in organizing the index compilation, and the person in charge is responsible for contacting the indexing expert to compile the book index. Thanks to the publisher’s high regard for indexes, the author has led the index compilation team in preparing back-of-book indexes for more than 200 academic works during the past five years, and most of them are national publishing-fund projects and in receipt of national book awards. This includes books such as the _Space Technology and Scientific Research Series_ (25 volumes), the _Aerospace Science and Technology Publishing Engineering Series_ (8 volumes), the _Space Launch Technology Series_ (10 volumes), the _Modern Weapons Fire System Series_ (17 volumes), the _Beijing Institute of Technology Yearbook_ post-volume index (five times), and so on.

Despite this, the proportion of newly published books with back-of-book indexes compared to all newly published books in China is still relatively low and needs to be improved. Zhou Bokang, a member of the China Society of Indexers, surveyed books published in 2013–14, and found that only 5.8 per cent included indexes (Zhou, [2014](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#core-R9)). Two years later, the survey data of Fudan University graduate students in Shanghai Bookstore found that 10 per cent of a sample of 60 literary books were indexed; 7 per cent of 60 social-science and philosophy books; and 5 per cent of the 60 books on nature and science (Xu, [2016](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#core-R8)).

According to the deputy director of the General Administration of Press and Publication, Wu Shulin, the index compilation rate before [2012](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#core-R7) was less than 3 per cent, rising to 7 per cent after five years, indicating that China’s back-of-book index compilation has made great progress. While giving full recognition to this, we should also be aware of the distance still to be bridged to reach the level of index compilation in Western developed countries; 95 per cent of academic books and 50 per cent of general books in the United States include back-of-book indexes (Schroeder, [2005](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#core-R6)). There is still considerable room for improvement in the number and quality of back-of-book indexes in China. It can be said that there is a long way to go.

## Compilation and summary of indexed works

It is not easy to publish an independent indexed work in China. This involves the direct restriction of the book industry on book number, total price, circulation, etc. Therefore it is understandable that the number of indexed works in China is small.

When discussing the collection and collation of China’s indexed works, it is necessary to refer to Mr Lu Zhengyan, a researcher at the Shanghai Normal University Library, who edited the _China Index Summary Sequel_, which was published by the Shanghai Lexicographical Publishing House in the year 2000. The book contains 3,192 kinds of indexed works in China from 1900 to 1998. It comprehensively brings together the important compilation results of China’s twentieth-century indexes (Lu, [2000](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#core-R1)). In the new century, Mr Ping Baoxing, librarian at Nanjing Normal University, continued to make efforts to compile details on the index documents officially published in China from 1999 to 2010, and continued to compile and complete the _China Index Summary Sequel_. The sequel is classified by description and 238 kinds of indexed work are recorded during this period (Ping, [2011](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#core-R3)).

In 2017, Mr Ping Baoxing continued to pick up the missing items on the basis of the _China Index Summary Sequel_, which was sorted according to the ‘Chinese Library Classification’, and increased the indexed works published in 2011–16. Indexed books are sorted in order of publication time, and the latest _China Index System Yearbook: 1999–2016_ was launched (Ping, [2018](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#core-R4)). In the comment of the yearbook, the author also summarizes the characteristics of the compilation and publication of Chinese book indexes. The viewpoint is refined and authoritative:

1.

it covers a wide range of subjects

2.

special funds are available for index publishing

3.

new and old indexes coexist

4.

university librarians participate in the research of the department responsible for the compilation of relevant topic indexes

5.

there are diverse index types.

In order to summarize the progress and achievements of China’s index compilation since the year 2000, the author has guided graduate students in conducting a search and addendum on the publication of indexed works in recent years. Ping Baoxing’s _China Index Summary Sequel_ and _China Index System Yearbook: 1999–2016_ are used as the basic data, and ‘index’ and ‘full text inspection’ are used as search terms for research in the National Digital Library of China, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and other related databases. Data on indexed works from the year 2000 to 2017 were obtained and then merged with the _China Index Summary Sequel_ and _China Index System Yearbook: 1999–2016_. After screening and replenishing the data to deal with duplicated and missing items, the final number of indexed works published in 2000–17 is 587, which is the latest data for China index compilation since the year 2000.

## Quantity and type analysis of indexed publications

Through the statistical analysis of the published data on China’s indexed works from the year 2000 to 2017, we can see that there are about 32 books with indexes published annually in China in the twenty-first century, and the number of published indexes exceeds that average for eight years, as shown in [Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#F1). The data on indexes published in 2017 are inaccurate due to the long time lag in the publication process and the acquisition of books by collection units such as libraries, and also access to the retrieval system. Excluding the 2017 data, we can see that the total number of indexed works published in China has shown a tortuous upward trend since the beginning of the century.

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#F1)

Specifically, the publication of indexed works from the year 2000 to 2017 showed a peak period in 2013, with 51 indexed books, which was a new high in recent years. The publication of indexed works from 2000 to 2007 showed a downward trend, decreasing by 36.36 per cent compared with 2000. With 2007 as a turning point, the number of published indexed works has shown an overall upward trend, especially since 2013. Although the number of indexed works published in the past five years has fluctuated from year to year, the number of indexed books published in 2016 was more than double that in 2007. This shows that the publication of indexed works in China has entered a new era of rapid development.

Investigating the types of indexing works, it can be seen that there are multiple index types coexisting in indexing works, such as _Lu Xun’s Complete Works: Index Volume_, which includes the names of people, places, articles, institutions and the author’s other work involved in the entire collection. Therefore, in the subsequent statistical analysis in this present paper, there will be cases where the number of index types is inconsistent with the number of indexed works. In the indexed works published from 2000 to 2017, the number of subject indexes is 73 and the number of special indexes is 520, meaning that the number of special indexes is seven times the number of subject indexes. This indicates that the special index became the most important type of index in the twenty-first century.

Special indexes are subdivided into subordinate types, such as word indexes, personal-name indexes, place-name indexes, organization indexes and title indexes, and then the 520 kinds of topic index are further divided. The results are as follows: 378 title indexes, accounting for 65.17 per cent of the total; 90 personal-name indexes, accounting for 15.52 per cent of the total; 86 word indexes, accounting for 14.83 per cent of the total; 19 place-name indexes, accounting for 3.28 per cent of the total; four chart indexes, accounting for 0.69 per cent of the total; three organization indexes, accounting for 0.52 per cent of the total. Among them, the number of title indexes occupies the vast majority, and there are 177 more than the sum of other types of index. The proportional relationship between the number of specific indexes is shown in [Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#F2).

## Index object and content analysis

The 587 indexed works published in the twenty-first century are divided into eight categories: academic works, ancient books, study materials, reference books, newspapers and periodicals, patent literature, collections and other literature. The specific values are shown in [Table 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#T1).

Table 1. Index object classification

| Index object type | Number of indexed works (parts) | Percentage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ancient books | 175 | 29.81 |
| Academic works | 148 | 25.21 |
| Learning materials | 105 | 17.89 |
| Reference books | 64 | 10.90 |
| Newspapers and periodicals | 53 | 9.03 |
| Collections | 34 | 5.79 |
| Patent literature | 4 | 0.68 |
| Other literature | 4 | 0.68 |

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#T1)

As shown in [Table 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#T1), there are 175 entries for ancient books, accounting for the largest percentage of the total number of indexed works. The number of indexed works for academic works is the second-largest, and occupying third place is learning materials. Altogether these three types of indexed object totalled 427, accounting for 72.74 per cent, which means that more than two-thirds of the indexed works are associated with ancient books, academic works and learning materials. The types of indexed object that were decreasing in turn were reference books, newspapers and periodicals, collections, patent literature and other literature. The total number of indexed works compiled for these documents was not more than one-third.

The subject content of the 587 indexed works published from the year 2000 to 2017 is classified according to the 22 categories of the Chinese Library Classification (politics and law are divided into two categories), and is shown in [Table 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#T2). Some categories have more indexes, others have fewer; five is the break point.

Table 2. Classification of subject matter content of indexed works (≥ 5 parts)

| Subject classification | Quantity | Percentage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| History and geography | 104 | 17.72 |
| Literature | 68 | 11.58 |
| Language and text | 48 | 8.18 |
| Art | 41 | 6.98 |
| Culture, science, education, sports | 30 | 5.11 |
| Politics | 27 | 4.60 |
| Philosophy and religion | 26 | 4.43 |
| Law | 25 | 4.26 |
| Medicine | 17 | 2.90 |
| Economics | 12 | 2.04 |
| Military | 10 | 1.70 |
| Biology | 7 | 1.19 |
| General theory of social science | 5 | 0.85 |

Classifying the 587 indexed works by subject content shows that social sciences account for the vast majority. Among the subjects with more than five indexed works published, only medicine and biological science belong to the natural sciences. Medicine and biological science rank behind, even the total number and proportion of the two types does not enter the top five. This shows that the indexed works do not prefer the natural sciences in terms of content, but rather the various subject areas of the social sciences. The top five subjects with indexed works are history and geography; literature; language; art; and culture, science, education and sports. This is basically consistent with the estimated distribution.

## Index compiler and publisher analysis

Index compilers can be divided into three types: independent compilers, co-compilers, and collective compilers (i.e. not signed by the individual, but indexed by the name of the institution). Among the 587 published indexed works during 2000–17, there are 259 independent compilers, with 311 published indexed works, accounting for 52.98 per cent of the total; 131 are co-compilers, with 146 published indexed books, accounting for 24.87 per cent of the total; and 106 are collective compilers, with 130 published indexed works, accounting for 22.15 per cent of the total. As shown in [Table 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#T3), more than half of indexed works are compiled by independent compilers.

Table 3. Index compiler subtype

| Compiler type | Number of index compilers | Number of index publications | Percentage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Independent compiler | 259 | 311 | 52.98 |
| Co-compiler | 131 | 146 | 24.87 |
| Collective compiler | 106 | 130 | 22.15 |

The index compilers can be analysed according to the number of indexes they have compiled. The individual who has indexed and officially published the most in the twenty-first century is Mr Liu Dianjue. In 18 years, he has compiled and published a total of seven indexed books. He is a famous translator in China and has made great achievements in the study of linguistics and Chinese philosophy. He has also made important contributions to the compilation of ancient books (Mao, [2012](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#core-R2)). He and Professor Chen Fangzheng jointly completed the index of large-scale ancient books: the _ICS Ancient Chinese Texts Concordance Series (Pre-Han & Han)_ and the _ICS Ancient Chinese Texts Concordance Series (Six Dynasties)_, both of which are well known at home and abroad.

Ranked second is Mr Zou Yuli, who has compiled and published five indexed books on legal subjects: the annual _Index to Legal Periodicals of China_ from 2001 to 2005. Other important index compilers include Zhang Ru’an, Yao Junzhou, Wang Xianzhao, Wang Gang, Shang Yanzhong and Kuang Yanzi, who have each compiled and published two indexed works in 18 years.

From 2000 to 2017, there were 206 publishing organizations producing independent indexing works. These can be divided into three main types: comprehensive publishing houses (81), professional publishing houses (88) and university publishing houses (37). The professional publishing houses have the largest number of indexed works, with a total of 307 publications, accounting for about half of the total number (52.30 per cent), indicating that professional publishers have become the main force in the publication of indexed works.

Although there are more than 200 publishing organizations for indexed works, the number of publications per publisher is very small, with an average of 2.85. There are only nine publishers that have published more than ten indexed works in 18 years. Among them, the National Library of China Publishing House, Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House and the Zhonghua Book Company are the three with the most published indexed books. In particular, the National Library of China Publishing House has published 49 indexed books, accounting for 8.35 per cent of the total number of indexed books published, far ahead of the Zhonghua Book Company and the Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House, which have both published 24 indexed works and are ranked second. Considering the attributes, public praise and publishing direction of the two publishers, this ranking is in line with the actual situation and is basically consistent with people’s expectations. [Table 4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#T4) shows the top ten publishers in terms of index compilation since the beginning of the century, which is for reference only.

Table 4. Top 10 index publishers

| Rank | Publishing house | Publisher type | Number of indexed publications | Percentage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | National Library of China Publishing House | Professional publishing house | 49 | 8.35 |
| 2 | Zhonghua Book Company | Professional publishing house | 24 | 4.09 |
| 3 | Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House | Professional publishing house | 24 | 4.09 |
| 4 | Thread-Binding Books Publishing House | Professional publishing house | 17 | 2.90 |

## The academic contribution of _China Index_

### China Index _as the first platform for index research_

_China Index_ was founded in 2003 by the China Society of Indexers and the editorial department is located at the Fudan University Library. It is the journal of the China Society of Indexers and the only professional journal of index research in China. Due to the customary practice of journal management, _China Index_ has been published for more than ten years as ‘Continuous Internal Data Permit’ No. 0041, which is also known as the ‘internal magazine’. It is treated as its own official professional journal, and also won the seventh National Library Science Journal Award.

Beginning in 2016, _China Index_ was changed to a collection, which was officially published by the Fudan University Press with a number (ISBN). At present, the main sections of the collection are: academic forum, index and database business, index language research and information organization, information retrieval and utilization, index history and historical materials, foreign industry scanning, and topic index.

After 15 years, _China Index_, although not as rich as Chinese core journals and CSSCI source journals, has already become a standard in index research, and it is also one of the major achievements of index compilation and research in China since the year 2000. Although ‘index’ is a concept with broad connotations, index research is also an prominent interdisciplinary subject. Many researchers have submitted index research papers to journals of library and information science, editorial journals and even social-science journals and university journals. But without caring about remuneration or the results of scientific research, more index researchers have submitted research papers to _China Index_. Therefore, since the year 2000, the number of professional indexed papers has been the largest, the index research results are the most concentrated, and information disclosure in the index field is the most extensive and timely in _China Index_.

_China Index_ publishes not only indexing-professional papers, but also excellent papers from the China Society of Indexers Academic Annual Conference. It also organizes thematic essay activities and forum discussions to make index research more targeted and index results obtained more direct. _China Index_ exceeds other magazines, strongly supports the major task of index research and index communication in China, and has become the first platform for index research.

### _Analysis of the publication of_ China Index

Statistical analysis of the publication of _China Index_ is based on a selection of professional literature and exclusion of document units that do not meet the standards of the indexing-professional papers. In the 15 years from 2003 to 2017, there were at least 1,000 document units published in _China Index_. Literature that does not involve indexing is not included in the statistical analysis. For example, papers devoted to information retrieval language, database technology, information resource organization and literature retrieval are all screened out, and this is confirmed by examining the full text. In addition, some articles popularizing indexes published in _China Index_ are too short, do not have the characteristics of the paper, and are not included in the statistical analysis.

Since _China Index_ is a journal of the China Society of Indexers, it must also sometimes publish relevant information about the Society to promote academic exchange among members of the Society. For example, the ‘Chinese Index Society page’, ‘Index and database news’ columns, annual speeches, work reports, society documents and other non-academic content is also excluded from the statistical analysis reported here. Less academic articles, such as the society newsletter, conference dynamics, professional books, English subjects and solicitation notices, are also naturally not included in the statistics.

The number of professional papers published in the 15 years of _China Index_ has been rigorously screened as described above. The total number of professional papers included in the statistical analysis was 411, and the average per annual volume was 27.4.

In the first four years of the publication of _China Index_ (2003–6), the volume of papers was above the annual average, and the following 11 years (2007–17), apart from 2012, were lower than the annual average. The year with the most papers was 2004, with 51, while 2016 was the year with the least, only 10. This was the first year that _China Index_ changed from an internal magazine to a collection, published only once per year. The number of papers published will naturally be small. The specific published situation of papers in _China Index_ for each specific year is shown in [Figure 4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#F4).

### _High-frequency words in_ China Index

The title information of 411 indexing-professional papers selected by the screening method described above was imported into the ROST Content Mining content analysis tool, and then word segmentation and word frequency analysis were used, meaningless vocabulary was filtered out, and finally high-frequency vocabulary since the publication of _China Index_ started was extracted. [Table 5](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#T5) shows the 36 highest-frequency terms.

Table 5. _China Index_ high-frequency terms

| Rank | Term | Frequency | Rank | Term | Frequency | Rank | Term | Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | index | 428 | 13 | development | 20 | 25 | citation | 14 |

Using the high-frequency vocabulary obtained in this way, the parameters of the high-frequency words of the network and the common word matrix were set, and then the semantic network diagram of the _China Index_ papers shown in [Figure 5](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#F5) was generated. Through the analysis of high-frequency words and semantic networks, the research hotspots and development trends of _China Index_ can be more accurately reflected.

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2020.15/asset/8a36546a-077d-4ae5-9314-98048a472c45/assets/graphic/indexer_2020_15_fig5.jpg)

Among the high-frequency terms, the word ‘index’ appears most frequently in the titles of published papers in _China Index_. This is unsurprising, but the frequency of ‘index’ appears to be particularly high. Ranked four times higher than the second-highest-frequency term (China), it indicates that the issues discussed in the papers published in _China Index_ are highly aggregated and highly professional. If the second-ranked high-frequency word, ‘China’, is combined with ‘the 12-digit high-frequency synonym ‘our country’ and the 23rd-ranked high-frequency synonym ‘national’, this indicates that _China Index_ is highly concerned with research on indexing issues in China.

The third-ranked high-frequency word is ‘prepared by’. If it is combined and analysed with the 10th-ranked high-frequency synonym ‘compilation’, and then the high-frequency word ‘China’ is included, it is clear that the most discussed issue in _China Index_ is ‘China index compilation’; this is precisely the core issue of index compilation and research, fully in line with the purpose of indexing-professional journals. In addition, the high-frequency words closely related to the high-frequency words ‘index’ and ‘compilation’ are ‘books’, ‘local history’ and ‘yearbook’, which equates to the three branches of index compilation and research in China since the beginning of the twenty-first century. It is completely consistent with the actual situation.

Another group of observations shows that most of the professional papers published in _China Index_ are centred around the guidelines of the China Society of Indexers. The word ‘society’ is ranked fifth in terms of frequency and is closely related to 13 other high-frequency words, such as ‘China’, ‘academic’, ‘annual meeting’, ‘summary’ and ‘seminar’. Words produce close semantic associations and constitute important nodes of semantic network graphs. This shows that China’s index researchers are closely connected and united through the guidance of the China Society of Indexers, and that their research is concentrated in _China Index_. They support and complement each other.

### _Research topics in_ China Index

According to content features, index research in the twenty-first century can be divided into seven fields, namely index theory, index compilation, index history and culture, new indexing technology and indexing software, indexing standards and internationalization, index evaluation and utilization, and other unidentified categories. Classifying the 411 professional papers published in _China Index_ in this way produces the graph shown in [Figure 6](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#F6).

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2020.15/asset/7ebeb756-e292-4278-a133-14cf65cc4551/assets/graphic/indexer_2020_15_fig6.jpg)

The legends on the x axis are, from left to right, ‘Index theory’, ‘Index compilation’, ‘New indexing technology and indexing software’, ‘Index history and culture’, ‘Indexing standards and index internationalization’, ‘Index evaluation and utilization’, ‘Other unidentified classes’.

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#F6)

These data show that among the professional papers published in _China Index_, the number on index compilation is the highest, with a total of 152 papers, accounting for 36.98 per cent of the total; the number on index theory research is 84, accounting for 20.44 per cent of the total, and in third place is index technology and indexing software, with 55, accounting for 13.38 per cent of the total. The number and proportion of research papers ranked in these top three categories shows that the characteristics of index research published in _China Index_ since the year 2000 underline the emphasis, combining theory with practice, and closely connecting with modern technology.

### _Authors_ in China Index

The 411 indexing-professional papers published in _China Index_ were published by 255 different authors, with 309 papers published by independent authors, accounting for 75.18 per cent. This indicates that the majority of indexing-professional papers in recent years are still independently completed by researchers, which is in line with the general situation in social-science research. The specific statistics are shown in [Table 6](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#T6).

According to Price’s law,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> the number of papers that core authors published in _China Index_ in the past 15 years is about six; that is, the authors who have published six or more papers in _China Index_ can be identified as the core authors of the journal. There are only three authors who have met the criteria for this condition, namely Zhang Qiyu, Ge Yongqing and Ping Baoxing.

Mr Zhang Qiyu published a total of 56 papers in _China Index_, far ahead of other independent authors. He is a leading figure in Chinese index research and has served as the editor-in-chief and honorary editor of _China Index_. Mr Ge Yongqing published 12 articles. He is the founder of the China Society of Indexers and the deputy editor of _China Index_, which confirms that the twenty-first century is the best period for Mr Ge Yongqing’s academic research, with frequent results. Also in second place is Mr Ping Baoxing, who also published 12 articles. In recent years, he has devoted himself to studying the history and culture of Chinese indexing, and he has written many books and won a high academic reputation for his outstanding achievements.

## Indexing-related research in other journals

### Publication of index research in other journals

Before _China Index_ was founded, index research papers were distributed among professional journals in fields such as editing and publishing, and library and information science, and also in university-based journals. Since the publication of _China Index_ from 2003 onwards, far fewer indexing research papers have been distributed among these other journals.

In order to get a complete picture of indexing research papers in the new century, full-text databases such as China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, Chongqing Vip Information and _Long yuan Journal_ were used as the data retrieval source, and the indexing research papers officially published between the year 2000 and 2017 were collected. Combined with the China Publishing Information Full-Text Database constructed by the Beijing Institute of Graphic Communication, the papers were screened and confirmed. The total number of papers published in other journals was 323. The number of papers published in each year from 2000 to 2017 is shown in [Figure 7](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#F7).

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2020.15/asset/341cbfee-2e6b-408b-b3dd-7572dce768b1/assets/graphic/indexer_2020_15_fig7.jpg)

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#F7)

As shown in [Figure 7](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#F7), there is no clear pattern to the number of indexing papers published by non-indexing journals. The only thing that can be said is that in the period from 2000 to 2002, before the publication of _China Index_, the number of index papers published by non-indexing journals was relatively large. In this three-year period, the largest number of papers was published in 2002 (36 papers) and the second-largest in 2000 (27 papers). After _China Index_ commenced publication, the number of indexing papers published in non-indexing journals began to decline slowly from 2003 to 2013, with an annual average of 16.4 articles.

In terms of the number of articles published, the journals for editing and publishing, the journals for library and information science, and the journals of universities are the main position for publishing. In first place were the journals for library and information science, publishing 140 papers and accounting for 43.34 per cent of the total; professional journals for editing and publishing were second, with 92 papers, accounting for 28.48 per cent; and journals published by universities were in third place with 53 papers, accounting for 16.41 per cent; the number of other general journals is 38, accounting for 11.77 per cent, ranking last (see [Figure 8](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#F8)).

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2020.15/asset/653776bf-c902-4435-bc0f-3a0ff7ff9069/assets/graphic/indexer_2020_15_fig8.jpg)

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#F8)

The detailed statistics of the various journals publishing indexing research papers reveal that 48 library and information science journals have published papers related to indexing research. The top three are _Library Journal_ (14 papers), _Library Theory and Practice_ (nine papers) and _Information Science_ (seven papers). There are 20 editing and publishing professional journals that haver published indexing research papers, the top three being _Chinese Journal of Scientific and Technology Periodicals_ (23 articles), _Yearbook Information and Research_ (18 articles, discontinued), and _Acta Editologica_ (eight articles). The number of university journals publishing indexing research papers is the largest, with 49 journals, but the total number of papers is small (53). The journal with the most articles is the _Journal of Nanjing University (Philosophy, Humanities and Social Sciences)_, with only three articles. The _Journal of Qujing Normal University_ and the _Journal of Foshan University (Social Science Edition)_ each published two papers. The publications of other general journals are more complicated. Relatively speaking, there are many indexing research papers published in archives and information journals. For example, _Lantai World_ and _Yunnan Archives_ have each published two papers.

### High-frequency terms in other journals

The title information of the 323 indexing-professional papers was imported into the ROST Content Mining content analysis tool, and then through word segmentation and word frequency analysis to filter and eliminate meaningless words, the high-frequency vocabulary of other journals publishing indexing research papers was extracted. [Table 7](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#T7) shows the top-ranked high-frequency terms.

Table 7. High-frequency terms in other journals

Using the high-frequency vocabulary summary table, the parameters of the high-frequency words of the network and the common-word matrix were set, and then the semantic network diagram shown in [Figure 9](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#F9) was generated. This analysis of high-frequency words and the semantic network more accurately reflects the hot research issues and development trends of indexing research papers published in other journals.

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2020.15/asset/4492c421-2d2d-4c72-bd69-d43a767d9c7e/assets/graphic/indexer_2020_15_fig9.jpg)

Figure 9. Semantic network diagram for indexing research papers in other journals

In [Figure 9](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#F9), the word ‘index’ is the number one high-frequency word in the indexing papers published by non-indexing journals, occurring 6.5 times more than the second-highest-frequency word, and it is found at the absolute center of the semantic network. The term ‘index’ also has semantic associations with 70 other high-frequency words, such as ‘compilation’, ‘China’, ‘citation’, ‘database’, ‘ancient books’, ‘literature, ‘search’ and ‘academic’. The research coverage is extensive and involves all aspects of academic research. ‘Research’ is the second-ranked high-frequency word, which is semantically related to nine ‘hot’ words, such as ‘prepared by, ‘China’, ‘literature’ and ‘search’, and the common words in the common-word matrix are mostly the same, indicating that indexing papers published by other journals are highly academic, mainly based on various aspects of index application research. The key areas are index compilation, database research, and ancient-books indexes.

The top 30 high-frequency words, such as ‘compilation’, ‘method’, ‘development’ and ‘function’, are all semantically related to the core word ‘index’, indicating that the indexing papers published by non-indexing journals are mainly focused on index compilation methods and index function. On the other hand, ‘citation’ as the fourth-ranked high-frequency word becomes an important node in the semantic network, and it is strongly associated with high-frequency words such as ‘function’, ‘journal’, ‘evaluation’, ‘technology’, ‘literature’ and both ‘domestic’ and ‘foreign’. Through this semantic correlation phenomenon, it can be concluded that in the professional journals of library and information science, the journals of editing and publishing, and university journals, researchers pay great attention to the index of citations at home and abroad. Citation indexes play an important role in the evaluation of scientific research and the results of this analysis show that there has been considerable emphasis on the evaluation and function of citation indexes in China in the twenty-first century.

### Research topics in other journals

As with the indexing research published in _China Index_, the 323 indexing research papers published in the non-indexing journals can be classified by topic, namely indexing theory, index compilation, indexing history and culture, new indexing technology and software, indexing standards and internationalization, and index evaluation and utilization. The data are shown in [Figure 10](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#F10).

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2020.15/asset/99d24dc0-478e-4dba-bb6e-110dc878fb65/assets/graphic/indexer_2020_15_fig10.jpg)

Figure 10. Subject classification of indexing research in other journals. The legend on the _x_ axis reads, from left to right, ‘Indexing theory’, ‘Index compilation’, ‘New indexing technology and software’, ‘Indexing history and culture’, ‘Indexing standards and internationalization’ ‘Index evaluation and utilization’.

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#F10)

Among the 323 indexing research papers, 103 were on index compilation, accounting for 31.89 per cent of the total. At the same time, indexing research papers are also in the top two in the rankings of journals on editing and publishing, journals for library and information science, university journals and general journals, which can be seen in other journals. How to index the issue of the index is the focus of attention of all parties, and it is also the subject of the most intensive research by researchers.

In contrast, the second research area is index evaluation and utilization, with 69 papers, and it is also in the top two in the rankings of editorial and publishing professional journals, university journals and general journals. This indicates that index evaluation and utilization have received special attention as interdisciplinary research topics. In particular, the scientific evaluation function of citation indexes is related to achievements in many fields and the promotion of professional titles. Researchers have published their own opinions, which naturally formed a special research hotspot. The least number of papers (12) is on index standards and index internationalization, indicating that these specialist areas are best dealt with by indexing professionals rather than by academics in other disciplines.

### Authors in other journals

The 323 papers published in other journals were written by 301 authors; the average paper was completed by 1.07 authors. It was found that 229 articles were published by independent authors, accounting for 70.9 per cent of the total; 94 papers were published by co-authors, accounting for 29.1 per cent of the total. However, there were no papers published by collective authors in other journals. This phenomenon deserves further study.

Table 8. Authors of indexing research papers in other journals

| Author type | Number of papers published |
| --- | --- |
| Independent author | 229 |
| Co-author | 94 |

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#T8)

Using Price’s law, the core author of non-indexing journals is calculated to be approximately 2.37. Using this value, there are seven core authors: Ping Baoxing and Qiu Junping both published 10 articles; Zhang Qiyu seven articles; and Ye Jiyuan, Chen Donghui, Mao Jianjun and Xu Yueying three articles each. Among the seven core authors, Zhang Qiyu and Ping Baoxing are also core authors in _China Index_. It can be seen that their research strength and output efficiency are among the best in China. Professor Qiu Junping from Wuhan University and Professor Ye Jiyuan from Nanjing University are leading figures in indexing research. They are also the vice presidents of the China Society of Indexers and have a well-deserved place in the list of core authors. The three core authors Mao Jianjun, Xu Yueying and Chen Donghui have made significant achievements in their research into indexing of ancient books, index compilation research and foreign indexing. They have also formed their own research areas and methods, which is worth studying by other researchers.

## Summary

### Index compilation in China

Through the above statistical analysis and review, it is not difficult to conclude that index compilation in China in the twenty-first century is considerable, but there are also many problems. The most important thing to improve is the number of indexed works. In the past 18 years, only 587 independent indexed books have been officially published, which is extremely incompatible with the title of the world’s largest publishing country. If we use 350,000 new books published each year in China as a base, then 587 indexed works only accounts for 0.95 per cent of those published since the year 2000! That is to say, only one indexed book is listed in every 12,000 new books, and this situation is in urgent need of improvement.

The progress of back-of-book index compilation is obvious to all, and the number is gradually increasing. The proportion of back-of-book indexes in academic works has risen from 3 to 7 per cent, but there is still a long way to go and this trend needs to be continued.

Most of back-of-book indexing is based on the subject index, the compilation of which is more difficult, but it can better support the index user searching for information. For the compilation of the subject index and the special index, Mr Wang Yanxiang proposed the ‘comprehensive subject indexing method’, and used this to compile a large number of indexes to yearbooks and local chronicles. This method, which combines index terms such as personal names, place names and titles into the form of a comprehensive subject index, has become the mainstream of back-of-book index compilation in China.

Independently published indexed works rarely include subject indexes (only 12.4 per cent of the total); most of them are special indexes, and mostly they are indexes of titles, accounting for 64.4 per cent of the total number of indexed works. This shows that the type of indexed work is relatively simple, and the development of index diversification is insufficient. In the future, it should focus on the compilation of advanced and practical subject indexes.

Taking into account the number and impact of index compilation in China over the past decade or so, the following are selected as being the representative figures, representative works and core publishing organizations.

The representative figures for back-of-book index compilation are Wang Yanxiang, Wu Dong, Zhang Ruoshu and their team. They have compiled the largest number of indexes, and their quality is also the best.

Representatives of the compilation of indexed works include Liu Dianjue, Zou Yuli, Lu Zhengyan, Ping Baoxing, Lin Zhongxiang, Fu Dehua, Wang Yanxiang and Wang Youpeng. They have all produced heavyweight indexing works, and their impact cannot be underestimated.

Representative works of the New Century Indexed Publication include the following:

•

_Shun Pao Index: 1919–1949_, edited by the Editorial Committee of _Shun Pao Index;_ this index of the articles compiled by more than 100 experts has high use value.

•

The _ICS Ancient Chinese Texts Concordance Series (Pre-Han & Han)_ and the _ICS Ancient Chinese Texts Concordance Series (Six Dynasties)_, edited by Liu Dianjue and Chen Fangzheng. These are large-scale ancient books indexes, of high quality, and famous at home and abroad.

•

The _Chinese Ancient Books Head Index_, compiled by the Editorial Board of the Chinese Ancient Books Headquarters. This consists of two parts: the four-corner number index and the author’s four-corner number index. It is an essential indexing tool for searching ancient books.

•

_The 20th-Century Chinese Biographical Data Index_, edited by Wang Minggen and Fu Dehua, Department of History of Fudan University. This is devoted to a topic index of character data, which is huge and exemplary.

•

_China Index Summary, China Index Summary Sequel_ and _China Index System Yearbook: 1999–2016_, edited by Lu Zhengyan and Ping Baoxing. These three interlinked indexed works, comprehensively combing and recording China’s indexed works from 1900 to 2016, are both academic and informative.

•

_Lu Xun’s Complete Works: Index Volume_, edited by Wang Yanxiang, covers names of people, places, titles, institutions and author comments. The index types are diverse and the editing techniques are advanced.

The core institutions publishing indexed works are the National Library of China Publishing House, the Zhonghua Book Company, and the Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House. Their publications are outstanding and their social influence is extensive.

### Indexing research in China

_China Index_ has become the main platform for indexing research in China, and its publication has reached the status of group magazine, supporting the major task of indexing research and indexing communication in China. From 2003 to 2017, the total number of indexing-research papers published in _China Index_ was 411, the top three subjects being index compilation, indexing theory and new indexing technology and software. From this we can see that research reported in _China Index_ is focused on indexing theory closely linked to indexing practice, and it is also closely integrated with modern technology.

Editing and publishing professional journals, library and information science journals, and journals based on universities constitute the second platform for indexing research. Among the 323 papers published in these journals, the largest number were on index compilation, followed by index evaluation and utilization, indicating that index evaluation and utilization are special topics for interdisciplinary research and have become a special research hotspot, even though they deviate from core indexing research. The combined analysis of the research topics published by the two major platforms shows that ‘index compilation research’ is the most important topic in all journals, and it has the largest number of publications, which is in line with the academic nature of indexing. However, there are obvious differences in the research focus of the two platforms. Through the analysis of high-frequency words and semantic-network graphs, the word ‘index’ is the number one high-frequency word in both platforms, and it is at the absolute centre of the semantic networks. However, the second- and third-highest-frequency words in _China Index_ are ‘China’ and ‘compilation’. The high-frequency words closely related to it are ‘books’, ‘local chronicles’ and ‘yearbooks’. In the other journals, 70 high-frequency words, such as ‘compilation’, ‘China’, ‘citation’, ‘database’, ‘ancient books’, ‘literature’, ‘search’ and ‘academic’, are semantically related to the word ‘index’. The research reported in these papers is very broad and covers all aspects of academic research.

There are 556 authors who have published papers on the two platforms, with independent authors accounting for more than 70 per cent. According to Price’s calculation and ranking according to number of papers, the common core authors of twenty-first-century indexing research are Zhang Qiyu, Ping Baoxing, Ge Yongqing, Qiu Junping and Ye Jiyuan. Coincidentally, four of these five core authors have also served as vice presidents of the China Society of Indexers.

### Future trends

It is expected that the number of index compilations in China will show a steady upward trend over the next five to ten years, and the index compilation rate in academic works is expected to exceed 10 per cent. This forecast is based on the relevant regulations issued by the state, which support index compilation. Some measures, such as publishing funding or force, may increase the quality of index compilation. The number of independently published indexed works will increase slowly, and the focus on the compilation of subject indexes will be greatly increased.

Predictions relating to indexing research, with strong promotion by the China Society of Indexers, suggest that people’s understanding of the index will be significantly improved, and that indexing talents will also be developed in the younger generation. Under this premise, indexing research will enter the fast lane, and the number of indexing research papers will grow rapidly. It is expected that the annual number of publications will exceed 50. The quality of research results will improve, and the field of indexing research will be gradually enriched.

(北京印刷学院新闻出版学院 102600)

摘 要 本文利用文献计量学和定量分析方法, 重点统计分析新世纪以来 (2000~2017年) 中国索引编纂状况和索引研究的定量特点。首先对新世纪索引编纂与研究命题的缘起和预期目标进行阐述, 对数据来源和筛选过程作出交代。其后对新世纪索引编纂状况和成果展开具体的统计分析, 认为中国书后索引编纂数量增多, 质量普遍提升;针对独立出版的索引著作辑录与总结成绩斐然;十几年来索引著作出版数量尚有不足, 但在索引编制类型、索引对象文献、索引反映的学科内容, 以及索引编纂者和索引出版单位分布等方面, 均已形成各自特点。在索引研究方面, 指出《中国索引》作为索引研究的第一平台对推动中国索引事业发展功不可没。针对《中国索引》与非索引类期刊发表的研究论文, 分别从论文刊发数量和特点、高频词和语义网络图呈现、研究主题聚类分析、论文作者统计与核心作者形成等多个角度展开分析和述评, 最后总结出新世纪以来中国索引编纂与研究的代表人物和索引编纂代表作品。

关键词 中国索引 索引编纂 索引研究 索引成果 定量分析

一、缘起和目标

时光飞逝, 转瞬之间我们就度过了21世纪的前十几年。随着2018年第七次世界索引峰会的临近, 就像2011年为了纪念中国索引学会成立20周年时曾推出系列化研究论文那样, 总结归纳新世纪以来中国索引编纂与研究成果, 探析索引编纂与研究的发展规律也被提上日程。

在半年多的素材积累阶段, 除了检索、汇总、筛选新世纪以来的索引研究论文, 笔者还重点阅读分析了若干篇总结性、综述性的索引研究论文。一个出乎意料的发现是, 某些论文研究方法正确而先进 (如共词聚类分析法、洛特卡定律), 使用的研究工具现代而高端 (如战略坐标图、SPSS18.0、PAJEK软件), 但得出的结论却很值得商榷。

王彦祥男, 北京印刷学院教授, 传播学和出版专业硕士研究生导师。中国索引学会副理事长, 中国地方志学会编辑出版研究会副会长。

如某篇论文以CNKI的学术期刊网络出版总库作为数据来源, 设定检索词为“ 索引”, 然后使用题名和关键词实施检索, 得到中国1991~2010年有关索引学研究论文总数为28805篇, 滤掉会议通知、会议报导、征稿启事等, 最终得到索引学研究论文共11498篇。数值看似很辉煌, 但明显与现实不符。笔者带领研究团队通过全面检索并浏览全文来认定索引专业论文, 获得自2000年至2017年18年间中国索引研究论文不过几百篇。那么1991~2010年的20年 (其中有10年的重合期) 间, 索引研究论文怎么能达到五位数?差距又怎么会相差十几倍?

还有一篇论文对中国索引学研究论文作者进行数值分析, 认为1991~2010年索引学论文作者群较符合洛特卡定律, 并已形成核心作者群。该文统计出的1991~2010年间各年段高频作者中, 除了张琪玉、侯汉清、王彦祥、邱均平、平保兴、 王雅戈等6位索引界翘楚位列其中, 其余80余位索引研究高频作者均不是中国索引学会会员, 索引界也不知其研究了什么、发表了何许成果。我们只能说, 这无疑是出现了“此索引非彼索引”现象。这也就激发了笔者对新世纪以来中国索引编纂和研究状况展开一次新的梳理, 并以科学、严谨、认真的态度进行索引研究成果的全文浏览、判断确认、数据分析, 以此匡正不实, 得出符合实际状况的研究结论。

于本文要达到的目标, 包括以下几点:

首先, 笔者带领研究团队搜索汇总了2000年以来中国大陆地区正式出版的索引著作, 并比对平保兴先生所作《〈中国索引综录〉续编》和《中国索引系年录:1999—2016》,<sup>1</sup>通过补遗和整理, 得出2000~2017年中国大陆地区索引著作出版的具体数量为587部。这一数量级与中国每年30多万种的著作出版量相比, 显得微乎其微, 也有如鲠在喉不得不说的必要。

其次, 《中国索引》是中国唯一一本索引专业期刊 (现为集刊), 自2003年创刊以来, 对于推动中国索引研究和信息交流发挥了重要的阵地作用。在编辑部主任温国强先生大力支持下, 笔者获得了《中国索引》自创刊以来到2017年第三期集刊所刊发的所有文献数据。与发表在其他期刊上的索引研究论文相比, 《中国索引》在论文刊载数量上明显占优, 那么这批论文探讨的索引专业问题有什么特点?对于推动中国索引事业发挥了什么作用?这自然成为本文要探究的重点问 题。

第三, 通过近年来持续建设“中国出版信息全文数据库”, 我们积累了10万量级的专业论文全文资源, 这其中也包括编辑出版类学术期刊上发表的索引研究全文。再通过网络检索、人工检索等途径, 获得了近乎所有的非编辑出版类期刊刊载的索引研究论文, 二者相加得出2000~2017年间中国大陆地区《中国索引》之外的索引研究论文总数为323篇。这些论文究竟讨论了什么问题?取得了哪些新成果、新进展, 也是本文要梳理和总结的内容之一。

第四, 随着新世纪以来计算机技术、网络技术、大数据技术的发展, 中国的索引编纂技术研究也不俗表现。从具体的各类索引编纂技巧和规律总结, 到索引软件研制开发, 再上升到索引国家标准的制订, 均有系统归纳和总结的必要。由于这些研究很少在研究论文中体现, 必须深入索引界获得第一手资料才能分析出实质内容。近年来笔者开发出“索引之星”软件, 参与中国索引学会工作并制订索引国家标准, 这些积累为索引技术开发研究等冷门问题挖掘提供了有力支撑, 也希望能为读者带来有价值的信息。

第五, 较多的学者关注索引研究, 但对于索引编纂重视不够。搜索新世纪以来 的索引研究论文发现, 目前对于索引编纂现状进行统计、调查、分析方面的论文确属凤毛麟角, 对中国索引编纂进行整体总结, 指出成绩与不足的论文则付之阙如。弥补此方面的研究缺憾, 盘点中国索引编纂的真实状况, 指出其未来发展方向, 也成为本文的一个大目标。

以下就是笔者对2000~2017年中国索引编纂与研究的分析述评, 衷心希望就教于索引界的专家同仁。

二、索引编纂新动态和新成果分析

索引编纂成果的呈现方式一般有三, 一种是作为独立的著作正式出版;另一种是附于被索引的著作之后, 作为该著作的有机组成部分一同发表或出版, 因此被称作卷后索引或书后索引;第三种是篇幅较小的索引编纂成果, 全文刊发在期刊或图书之内。中国目前环境下, 书后索引编纂的数量最多, 但难于统计;独立出版的索引著作显示度最强, 但数量最少。

1.书后索引编纂增多, 质量普遍提升

新世纪以来, 中国书后索引的编纂数量明显增加, 质量持续上升。究其原因, 主要是国家各级管理层对于索引编纂的强调, 以及对学术著作出版的进一步规范。如原国家新闻出版总署邬书林副署长2012年1月在北京参加《中国文库·第五辑》出版座谈会时指出:解放前学术著作做索引的比例是23%~32%, 联合国平均是28%左右。上世纪60年代前我们国家还有百分之十几的学术著作在做索引, 现在做索引的不到3%。<sup>2</sup>

邬书林强调, 学术著作的出版要有严格的门槛, 要有基本的出版规范, 索引 、 注释、主题词、参考文献等基本要素要健全, 要把知识的来龙去脉介绍清楚, 以方便读者和开展学术交流。他还指出, 新闻出版总署将很快发一个文件, 对学术著作的出版, 从标准规范上提出明确要求, 不符合学术标准和规范的著作, 将来出版基金不资助, 不能参与出版评奖, 重要出版物的选录也不选。<sup>3</sup>

这种强调和要求是必要的, 在中国也是比较容易奏效的。政府出版主管部门和主管领导的表态可以说是立竿见影, 很快在中国各类出版物评奖和出版资助方面都开始强调学术规范, 其中就包括要编制索引, 否则取消申报资格或者给予评比扣分。如笔者参与多年的中国版协年鉴工委会组织的“全国年鉴编校质量评比”, 明确规定参评年鉴若没有编制卷后索引将扣减5分。这5分的扣减意味着参评年鉴将无缘特等奖和一等奖的竞争, 由此带动了绝大多数参评年鉴都纷纷编制卷后索引, 客观上促进了年鉴编纂出版的规范化。

与年鉴界的做法相类似, 中国新修地方志也相当重视卷后索引的编纂。中国地方志指导小组于2008年10月印发《地方志书质量规定》, 在“第三章:体裁”之第十一条中写明, 地方志书包括“述、记、志、传、图照、表、录、索引”等八体。这是中国志书编纂历史上首次且明确地把“索引”纳入志书编修体例。这一举措极大地促进了新地方志的索引编纂, 目前各地编修的新志中索引越来越多, 质量也越来越好。未来2020年全国第三轮新修地方志工程启动时, 中国地方志指导小组还将出台新的规定, 其中包括新修地方志必须编制卷后索引, 也就是说今后新修地方志的卷后索引将从“可选项目”变成“必备项目”。

图书出版单位近年来也开始重视学术著作书后索引的编制问题, 很多出版社 还出台了相关工作细则和保障措施。譬如, 北京理工大学出版社规定, 对于重点学

术著作, 必须由责任编辑牵头组织索引编纂, 由专人负责联系索引专家编制书后索引。也是得益于该出版社对索引的高度重视, 笔者带领索引编纂团队近五年为该社200多种学术著作编制了书后索引, 且绝大多数都是国家出版基金项目、参评国家图书奖的图书, 如《空间技术与科学研究丛书》索引 (25种) 、《航空航天科技出版工程丛书》索引 (8种) 、《航天发射技术丛书》索引 (10册) 、《现代兵器火力系统丛书》索引 (17册) 、《北京理工大学年鉴》卷后索引 (5次), 等等。

尽管如此, 中国新出版图书的书后索引编纂比例仍然比较低, 亟待提高。有相关调查数据可以佐证, 中国索引学会会员周柏康调查统计了2013~2014年出版的相关图书, 发现只有5.8%的图书编制了各类型索引。<sup>4</sup>两年后复旦大学研究生在上海书店的调查数据是:抽取60种文学类图书中, 有10.0%编制有索引;各60种社会科学和哲学类图书中, 有7.0%编制有索引;60种自然科学类图书中, 有5.0%编制有索引。<sup>5</sup>

从邬书林副署长所说的2012年前索引编纂比率不到3%, 到五年后上升到7%, 说明中国的书后索引编纂有了长足进步。在给予充分肯定的同时, 我们也应该看到差距, 因为相较于西方发达国家的索引编纂, 如美国95%的学术书籍和50%的一般图书都编制有书后索引,<sup>6</sup>中国的书后索引编纂数量和质量还有很大的上升空间, 可以说是任重而道远。

2\. 索引著作的辑录与总结成绩斐然

作为独立出版的索引著作, 在中国能够问世也是很不易的事情, 这牵涉到出版界有关书号、码洋、发行量等问题的直接制约, 因此说索引著作出版数量偏少也不能过于苛求。

谈及中国索引著作的搜集整理, 必然要说到上海师范大学图书馆卢正言先生主编、上海辞书出版社2000年出版的《中国索引综录》。该书收录1900年至1998年间中国索引著作3192种, 可以说是全面汇集了中国20世纪的索引重要编纂成果。<sup>7</sup>

迈入新世纪, 南京师范大学图书馆平保兴先生继续, 辑录1999年至2010年间中国正式出版的索引文献, 完成 《〈中国索引综录〉续编》。《续编》以类相从, 著录该时间段的索引著作凡238种。<sup>8</sup>

至2017年, 平保兴先生在依照《中图法》分类排序的《〈中国索引综录〉续编》 基础上, 继续拾遗补缺, 增加2011~2016年出版的索引著作, 并改为以索引著作出版年代排序, 最新推出《中国索引系年录:1999—2016》<sup>9</sup>在该《系年录》文前的“ 按语”中, 作者还总结出中国图书索引编纂与出版的特点, 观点精到, 颇具权威性, 故兹列于此:(1) 覆盖学科面广; (2) 专项经费资助索引出版; (3) 新、旧索引并存; (4) 高校图书馆员参与院系科研课题, 负责相关专题索引的编写; (5) 索引类型多样。

为总结新世纪以来中国索引编纂的新进展、新成就, 笔者指导研究生对近年来的索引著作出版情况再次进行了检索和补遗。我们以平保兴所作《〈中国索引综录〉续编》《中国索引系年录:1999—2016》为数据基础, 以“索引”“引得”“通检”为检索词, 分别对中国国家数字图书馆、中国知网等相关数据库进行检索, 获得2000年至2017年的索引著作数据, 再与《〈中国索引综录〉续编》《中国索引系年录:1999—2016》进行合并与筛选, 经删除重复、补充遗漏, 最终得到2000~2017年索引著作出版的确切数量为587部, 这也是新世纪以来我国索引编纂的最新数据。

3\. 索引著作数量分析与类型分析

通过对2000~2017年中国索引著作出版数据的统计算可知, 新世纪以来中国平均每年出版索引著作约32部, 出版索引数量超过平均值的年份有8年, 具体见图 1所示。

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2020.15/asset/a695a912-8f4d-47b4-9a6f-9c000c05501b/assets/graphic/indexer_2020_15_fig1.jpg)

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#figure-11)

其中, 2017年的索引著作出版数据, 因图书出版后再到图书馆等收藏单位以及进入检索系统存在较长的时滞现象, 目前统计数据是不完全的, 尚有较多的索引著作没有搜索到, 从而未能在图表中显示出来。除去这一不实因素我们可知, 新世纪以来中国索引著作出版的总体数量呈现曲折上升的趋势。

具体而言, 2000~2017年的索引著作出版在2013年出现了一个高峰期, 是年出版了51部索引著作, 创近年来新高;而2000~2007年索引著作出版呈现了一个波动下降趋势, 其中2007年索引著作出版数量相较于2000年下降了36.36%。以2007年作为转折点, 其后的索引著作出版数量整体上呈现起伏增长趋势, 尤其是2013年之后索引著作出版和增长速度均上升到一个新层级。近五年的索引著作出版虽然在个别年份内数量有波动, 但2016年索引著作出版数量相较于2007年已提高了一倍多, 这说明中国索引著作出版已步入一个快速发展的新时期。

对索引著作类型进行考察, 可知索引著作中存在多种索引类型并存的现象, 如《鲁迅大全集·索引卷》一书, 包含了全集中所涉及的人名、地名、篇名、机构索 引, 以及撰主著述篇目索引等五种索引。因此在本文后续统计分析中, 会出现索引

类型数量与索引著作数量不一致的情况。据统计, 2000~2017年出版的索引著作中, 主题索引数量为73部, 专题索引数量有520部, 专题索引数量是主题索引数量的7倍之多, 说明专题索引成为新世纪索引编纂的绝对性主流类型。

将专题索引细分为语词索引、人名索引、地名索引、机构索引、篇目索引等下属类型, 再对520种专题索引进一步划分, 结果如下:篇目索引计378部, 占总数的 65.17%;人名索引计90部, 占15.52%;语词索引计86部, 占14.83%;地名索引有19 部, 占3.28%;图表索引计4部, 占0.69%;机构索引计3部, 占0.52%。可见, 篇目索引数量占据绝大多数, 比其他几类索引数量之和还多出177部, 具体索引数量的比例关系详见图2。

4\. 索引著作对象文献分析与索引学科内容分析

将新世纪出版的587部索引著作所针对的索引对象, 划分为学术著作、古籍文献、学习资料、工具书、报刊文献、专利文献、作品集、其他文献等8类, 进行相应的归类和统计, 得到下列表1的具体数值:

表1 索引对象文献分类统计表

<table><tbody><tr data-xml-align="center"><td>索引对象类型</td><td>索引著作数量 (部)</td><td>占比 (%)</td></tr><tr data-xml-align="center"><td>古籍文献</td><td>175</td><td>29.81</td></tr><tr data-xml-align="center"><td>学术著作</td><td>148</td><td>25.21</td></tr><tr data-xml-align="center"><td>学习资料</td><td>105</td><td>17.89</td></tr><tr data-xml-align="center"><td>工具书</td><td>64</td><td>10.90</td></tr><tr data-xml-align="center"><td>报刊文献</td><td>53</td><td>9.03</td></tr><tr data-xml-align="center"><td>作品集</td><td>34</td><td>5.79</td></tr><tr data-xml-align="center"><td>专利文献</td><td>4</td><td>0.68</td></tr><tr data-xml-align="center"><td>其他文献</td><td>4</td><td>0.68</td></tr></tbody></table>

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#TA1)

从表1中不难发现, 以被索引的对象文献类型多寡排列, 针对古籍文献的索引著作最多, 有175部, 占索引著作总数的29.81%;针对学术著作的索引著作数量次之, 计147部, 占总数的25.04%;占据第三位的是针对学习资料的索引, 有105部, 占比为17.89%。这三类被索引对象文献类型总数达到427种, 占比为72.74%, 也就是说超过三分之二的索引著作, 都是针对古籍文献、学术著作和学习资料的。其后第次减少的索引对象文献类型分别是工具书、报刊文献、作品集、专利文献及其他文献, 针对这几种文献所编纂的索引著作加在一起, 总数也没有达到三分之一 。

将18年来出版的587部索引著作所涉及的学科内容, 参照《中图法》的22大类进行分类 (政治和法律拆分为两类), 得到这些索引著作的学科内容分类结果, 表2 即是大类数量达到和超过5部的索引著作分类统计表。

表2 索引著作学科内容分类统计表 (≥5部)

<table><tbody><tr data-xml-align="center"><td data-xml-align="left">学科 分类</td><td>历史、地理</td><td>文学</td><td>语言 文字</td><td>艺术</td><td>文化、科学、教育、体育</td><td>政治</td><td>哲学、宗教</td><td>法律</td><td>医学</td><td>经济</td><td>军事</td><td>生物科学</td><td>社会科学总论</td></tr><tr data-xml-align="center"><td data-xml-align="left">数量</td><td>104</td><td>68</td><td>48</td><td>41</td><td>30</td><td>27</td><td>26</td><td>17</td><td>25</td><td>12</td><td>10</td><td>7</td><td>5</td></tr><tr data-xml-align="center"><td data-xml-align="left">占比 (%)</td><td>17.72</td><td>11.58</td><td>8.18</td><td>6.98</td><td>5.11</td><td>4.60</td><td>4.43</td><td>4.26</td><td>2.90</td><td>2.04</td><td>0.17</td><td>0.19</td><td>0.85</td></tr></tbody></table>

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#TA2)

很显然, 以学科内容来类分587种索引著作, 社会科学占到绝大多数, 出版5部以上的索引著作中, 仅有“医学”和“生物科学”属于自然科学, 且数量和占比都是靠后的, 两类相加的总数和占比也未能进入前五位。这说明索引著作在内容方面并不眷顾自然科学, 而是钟情于社会科学的各个学科领域。数据显示, 数量和占比排在前五位的索引著作分别是“历史、地理”、“文学”、“语言文字”、“艺术”和“文化、科学、教育、体育”, 这一统计结果估计跟人们猜想的数量分布基本吻合。

5\. 索引编纂者分析与索引出版者分析

若将索引编纂者划分为独立编纂者、合作编纂者以及集体编纂者 (即不以个人名义署名, 而是以机构名称署名的索引编纂者) 三个类型, 那么在2000~2017 年出版的587种索引著作中, 独立编纂者占到259人, 出版索引著作311部, 占总数的52.98%;合作编纂者有131位, 出版索引著作146部, 占总数的24.87%;集体编纂者为106人, 出版索引著作130部, 占总数的22.15%。从这组数据可以看出, 2000~2017年索引著作以独立编纂者出版的居多, 且突破了总数的一半数量, 详见表3 示。

表3 索引编纂者分类型统计表

<table><tbody><tr data-xml-align="center"><td>编纂者类型</td><td>索引编纂数量</td><td>索引出版数量</td><td>占比 (%)</td></tr><tr data-xml-align="center"><td>独立编纂者</td><td>259</td><td>311</td><td>52.98</td></tr><tr data-xml-align="center"><td>合作编纂者</td><td>131</td><td>146</td><td>24.87</td></tr><tr data-xml-align="center"><td>集体编纂者</td><td>106</td><td>130</td><td>22.15</td></tr></tbody></table>

再分析索引编纂者的索引编纂数量, 新世纪以来编纂索引并正式出版最多者是刘殿爵先生, 18年间共编纂出版了7部索引著作。刘殿爵先生是中国著名翻译家, 在语言学和中国哲学研究方面成绩斐然, 并在古籍索引编纂方面做出了重要贡献,<sup>10</sup>他与陈方正教授共同完成的大型古籍索引——《先秦两汉古籍逐字索引丛刊》《魏晋南北朝古籍逐字索引丛刊》已名扬海内外。

排名第二的是邹育理先生, 邹先生在2001~2005年间每年主编一部《中国法律期刊文献索引», 共编纂出版了5部法律学科的索引著作。其他重要作者还有张如安、幺峻洲、王宪昭、王刚、尚衍重、邝子等人, 都是18年内编纂出版了2部索引著作。

2000~2017年出版过独立索引著作的出版机构共206家, 按出版社类型划分, 主要有综合性出版社、专业出版社和大学出版社三类, 据统计, 综合性出版社有 81家, 专业出版社88家, 大学出版社37家。其中, 专业出版社出版索引著作数量最多, 共出版了307部, 占据半壁江山 (52.30%), 这表明专业出版社成为索引著作的出版主力军。

尽管索引著作的出版机构超过200家, 但每一家的出版数量却很少, 平均值为 2.85种, 18年间出版索引著作达到和超过10部的出版社仅有9家。其中, 国家图书馆出版社、上海古籍出版社、中华书局是出版索引著作最多的三家。尤其是国家图书馆出版社出版有49部, 占索引著作出版总数的8.35%, 遥遥领先。中华书局和上海古籍出版社均出版了24部索引著作, 并列第二位, 从两家出版社的属性、口碑和出版方向考察, 这一排序符合实际状况, 与人们的期望也基本一致。表4是新世纪以来索引著作出版位列前10的出版社统计表。

三、《中国索引》的学术贡献

1\. 《中国索引》成为索引研究的第一平台

《中国索引》创刊于2003年, 由中国索引学会主办, 编辑部设在复旦大学图书馆。该刊即是中国索引学会的会刊, 也是中国索引研究唯一的专业刊物。由于期刊管理的习惯性做法, 《中国索引》自创刊以来一直以上海市连续性内部资料准印证第0041号的名义, 也就是“内刊”的形式出版发行10余年, 但中国索引界始终把它当作自己的正式专业期刊来看待, 《中国索引》还曾获得第七届全国图书馆学期刊表彰奖。

2016年开始, 《中国索引》改为集刊, 由复旦大学出版社用国际标准书号正式出版。目前集刊设置的主要栏目有:学术论坛、索引与数据库事业、索引语言研究与信息组织、信息检索与利用、索引史话与史料、国外业界扫描、专题索引等。

走过了15年的《中国索引》, 虽然不像中文核心期刊、CSSCI来源期刊那样风光无限, 但在索引研究方面早已成为一面旗帜, 也是新世纪以来中国索引编纂与研究的重大成果之一。尽管“索引”是一个内涵外延很宽泛的概念, 索引研究也属于

图3 《中国索引》书影

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#figure-13)

跨学科的“显学”, 许多研究者将索引研究论文投向图书馆学情报学期刊、编辑出版学期刊, 甚至投给社会科学总类期刊和各大学学报, 但是在没有稿酬, 也不计算科研成果的前提下, 更多的索引研究者将自己的研究论文投给了《中国索引》。 因此说, 新世纪以来刊发索引专业论文数量最多, 索引研究成果最为集中, 索引领域信息披露最为广泛和及时者, 非《中国索引》莫属。

《中国索引》不仅发表索引专业论文, 择优刊载中国索引学会学术年会的优秀论文, 还经常组织专题征文和论坛研讨, 使索引研究的针对性更强, 取得的索引成果更直接。《中国索引》一刊抵群刊, 强力支撑起中国索引研究和索引传播的大任, 成为名副其实的索引研究第一平台。

2.《中国索引》刊文情况分析

此次进行《中国索引》刊文统计分析, 首先是进行专业文献的遴选, 对不符合索引专业论文标准的文献单元予以删除。2003~2017年的15年间, 在《中国索引》上刊发的文献单元至少有1000个以上, 但内容不是探讨索引领域问题的文献均不在本次统计分析之列, 以保证索引研究的纯正性。如专门探讨情报检索语言、数据库技术、信息资源组织、文献检索等方面的论文, 我们通过全文浏览、判断确认, 均被筛选出来并剔除出去。同样, 《中国索引》刊登的篇幅过小、不具备论文特质的索引研究成果和索引知识普及小文章, 也不在统计分析之列。

《中国索引》既然是中国索引学会的会刊, 那么它也要及时发布学会相关信息, 以促进学会会员的学术交流。诸如设置“中国索引学会之页”、“索引与数据库新闻”专栏, 刊登学术年会致辞、工作报告、学会文件等, 如果不具备学术性, 则均排除在论文统计之外。那些学会简讯、学术信息、会议动态、专业书讯、英文要目、征文启事等不属于学术论文的文献单元, 自然也未被列入刊文统计。

经严格筛选, 刊15年的《中国索引》专业论文刊文数量, 经过以上描述的严格筛选, 最后被纳入统计分析的专业论文总数为411篇, 平均年刊文量为27.4篇。

《中国索引》创刊前4年 (2003~2006年) 刊文量在年平均量之上, 而后的11年 (2007~2017年) 除去2012年, 均低于年均刊文量。刊文最多的年份是2004年, 达到了51篇;2016年则是刊文最少的一年, 只有10篇, 即《中国索引》由内刊改为集刊

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2020.15/asset/fbc43087-10c8-42b9-885f-6d988e1b7def/assets/graphic/indexer_2020_15_fig4.jpg)

的第一年, 因全年只出版了一辑, 论文刊发数量自然就会很少。具体各年度的《中国索引》论文刊发情况详见图4所示。

3\. 高频词和语义网络图呈现与分析

将筛选确定的411篇索引专业论文的题名信息导入ROST Content Mining内容 分析工具, 再通过分词和词频分析, 并过滤剔除无意义词汇, 最后提取出《中国索 引》自创刊以来的高频词表, 表5所示便是排名最前的36个高频词汇总表。

在获取以上高频词表基础上, 笔者对构建网络和共词矩阵的高频词进行参数设置, 进而生成如图5所示的《中国索引》论文语义网络图。通过对高频词和语义网络进行分析, 可以较为准确地反映《中国索引》的研究热点及发展趋势。

从高频词方面观察, 《中国索引》刊发的论文中出现最多的是“索引”一词, 这是不需讨论, 也是毋庸置疑的, 但“索引”一词出现频次之高, 竟是排在第二位高频词的4倍, 说明《中国索引》刊发论文所讨论问题的聚合度很高, 专业性也很强。排名第二位的高频词是“中国”, 如果将排名第12位的高频同义词“我国”, 排名第23位的高频同义词“全国”合并分析, 说明《中国索引》高度关注的是中国索引问题研究。

排名第三位的高频词是“编制”, 如果将排名第10位的高频同义词“编纂”合并分析, 再联系高频词“中国”, 那么明确可知《中国索引》讨论最多的问题是“中国索引编纂”, 这恰恰是索引编纂与研究的最核心问题, 完全符合索引专业期刊的办刊宗旨。另外, 与高频词“索引”“编制”紧密关联在一起的高频词是“图书”“ 地方志”和“年鉴”, 这提示出新世纪以来中国索引编纂与研究的三大分支方向, 也完全与实际情况相吻合。

另一组观察反映出, 《中国索引》刊发的专业论文大多围绕中国索引学会的指引而展开。因为从论文语义网络图中发现, “学会”这一词汇竟然位居高频词的第五位, 而且与“中国”“学术”“年会”“纪要”“研讨会”等13个高频词产生紧密的

语义关联, 构成语义网络图的重要节点, 这说明中国的索引研究者联系紧密, 在中国索引学会指导下团结奋进, 取得成果后又集中展现在《中国索引》期刊上, 可谓是相互支撑、相得益彰。

4\. 论文研究主题聚类分析

笔者依据新世纪以来中国索引研究成果体现出的内容特点, 将其划分为七大研究领域, 即索引理论、索引编制、索引历史与文化、索引新技术与索引软件、索引标准和索引国际化、索引评价与利用、其他未确定类等。将《中国索引》刊载的411

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2020.15/asset/7ebeb756-e292-4278-a133-14cf65cc4551/assets/graphic/indexer_2020_15_fig6.jpg)

图6 《中国索引》论文主题分类统计

篇专业论文, 以七大类研究领域进行分类, 可得到图6所示的数据统计和图形显示。

通过统计可知, 《中国索引》刊载的所有专业论文中, 索引编制类研究论文数量最多, 共152篇, 占总数的36.98%;索引理论类研究论文数量为84篇, 占20.44%, 排名第二;位居第三位的则是索引技术和索引软件研究论文, 数量达到55篇, 占 13.38%。从位列三甲的研究论文数量和占比情况, 可以充分体会到新世纪以来《 中国索引》的研究特点是:重点突出, 理论联系实际, 且与现代技术紧密结合。

5\. 论文作者统计分析

《中国索引》刊发的411篇索引专业论文, 由255位署名作者共同完成。其中, 独立作者发表的论文总数为309篇, 占比达到75.18%, 说明近年来索引专业论文绝大多数还是由研究者独立完成, 符合社会科学研究的一般规律。统计数据详见表 6。

表6 《中国索引》论文作者统计表

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#TA6)

根据普莱斯定律计算得出, 15年来《中国索引》的核心作者发文数约等于6, 即在《中国索引》上发表6篇及以上论文的作者, 可确定为该刊的核心作者。经过统计符合这一条件的核心作者只有三位, 即张琪玉、葛永庆、平保兴。

张琪玉先生在《中国索引》上共发表论文56篇, 遥遥领先于其他独立作者, 这与张琪玉先生作为中国索引研究的泰斗级人物, 先后担任《中国索引》的主编和名誉主编, 常年笔耕不辍, 成果丰硕是完全吻合的。葛永庆先生刊文12篇, 他是中国索引学会创始人, 《中国索引》副主编, 这从一个侧面印证出21世纪正是葛永庆先生学术研究活跃, 成果频出的最好时期。并列第二位的是平保兴先生, 同样刊文12篇, 他近年来潜心研究中国索引历史与文化, 且著述颇多, 以优秀成果赢得了很高的学术声誉。

四、非索引类期刊发表论文状况及特点

1\. 非索引类期刊论文发表情况

索引论文在《中国索引》创刊之前, 都是分散发表于编辑出版学、图书馆学情报学等专业期刊, 以及大学学报为主的期刊上。2003年《中国索引》创刊后, 这一分散发表索引论文现象仍然存在, 只不过数量有所减少而已。

为掌握新世纪以来完整的索引研究论文状况, 笔者以中国知网、万方数据、重庆维普、龙源期刊等全文数据库为数据检索源, 全面搜集了2000~2017年间正式发表的索引研究论文, 并结合北京印刷学院建设的“中国出版信息全文数据库” 进行全文甄别、筛选确认, 最终获得非索引类期刊发表的论文总数为323篇。将这

些索引论文归入各个年份, 得到图7所示的非索引类期刊发表索引论文的年代分布状况。

从图7窥见, 非索引类期刊发表的索引论文数量没有什么规律可循, 唯一可说的就是在《中国索引》创刊前的2000~2002年, 非索引类期刊发表索引论文数量相对较多, 其中发表论文数量最多的2002年 (发表36篇), 以及并列第二多的2000 年 (发表27篇) 均在这三年之内。《中国索引》创刊后, 2003~2013年非索引类期刊发表索引论文数量开始缓慢下降, 平均年刊文量为16.4篇。

从发文数量上看, 编辑出版学专业期刊、图书馆学情报学专业期刊以及大学学报是发表索引研究论文的主阵地。其中, 图书馆学情报学专业期刊的刊文数量为 140篇, 占43.34%, 排名第一;编辑出版学专业期刊刊文数量是92篇, 占比28.48%, 排名第二;各大学学报的刊文数量为53篇, 占比16.41%, 排名第三;其他一般性期刊的刊文数量总计38篇, 占比11.77%, 排在最后。

通过各类期刊发表索引研究论文的统计可知, 有48种图书馆学情报学专业期刊刊发过索引研究论文, 刊文数量排名前三的期刊是《图书馆杂志》《图书馆理论和实践》《情报科学》, 发文数量分别是14篇、9篇和7篇。有20种编辑出版学专业期刊发表过索引研究论文, 刊文数量排名前三的期刊是《中国科技期刊研究》

《 年鉴信息与研究》 (已停刊) 、《编辑学报》, 具体数量分别为23篇、13篇、8 篇。大学学报中刊发索引研究论文的数量最多, 有49种学报, 但载文量都较少, 刊 文最多的《南京大学学报 (哲学·人文科学·社会科学版) 》也仅发表了3篇论文; 其后是《曲靖师范学院学报》和《佛山科学技术学院学报 (社会科学版) 》, 各发表过2篇论文。其他一般性期刊刊文较为复杂, 相对而言档案类、信息类期刊发表的索引研究论文较多, 如《兰台世界》《云南档案》期刊各刊发过2篇论文。

将323篇索引专业论文的题名信息导入ROST Content Mining内容分析工具, 再通过分词和词频分析, 过滤剔除无意义词汇, 最后提取出非索引类期刊发表索引研究论文的高频词表。表7就是排名最前的39个高频词汇总表。

在以上高频词汇总表基础上, 再对构建网络和共词矩阵的高频词进行参数设置, 进而生成如图9所示的非索引类期刊发表索引论文语义网络图。通过对高频词和语义网络进行分析, 可较为准确地反映出非索引类期刊发表索引论文蕴含的研究热点问题及发展趋势。

通过分析图9可知, “索引”一词是非索引类期刊刊发的索引论文中排名第一的高频词, 出现频率是第二高频词的6.5倍, 处于语义网络的绝对中心。“索引”一词还与“编制”“中国”“引文”“数据库”“古籍”“文献”“检索”“学术”等70个高频词产生语义关联, 说明非索引类期刊发表的索引论文研究覆盖面很广, 涉及到学术研究的方方面面。“研究”是排名第二的高频词, 其与“编制”“中国”“文献”“检索”等9个热词产生语义关联, 且二者共词矩阵中共有词汇大多相同, 表明非索引类期刊发表的索引论文学术含量较高, 主要以各方面的索引应用研究为主, 重点领域是索引编制、数据库研究、古籍索引等。

从研究内容来看, “编纂”“方法”“发展”“功能”等排名前30位的高频词, 都与“索引”这一核心词产生语义关联, 说明非索引类期刊发表的索引论文对于索引编制方法、索引功能发挥等问题探讨是其主攻方向。

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2020.15/asset/4492c421-2d2d-4c72-bd69-d43a767d9c7e/assets/graphic/indexer_2020_15_fig9.jpg)

图9 非索引类期刊发表索引论文语义网络图

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#figure-19)

另一方面, “引文”作为排名第四的高频词, 在语义网络中成为重要节点, 且与“功能”“期刊”“评价”“科技”“文献”“国内外”等高频词产生较强的语义关联。通过这一语义关联现象可以引申出, 在图书馆学情报学专业期刊、编辑出版学专业期刊以及大学学报中, 研究者对国内外的引文索引高度关注, 对于引文索引在科学评价中的功能发挥有较为强烈的重视和期待, 这恰好与新世纪以来中国对于引文索引研究和引文索引评价功能研究形成一个小高潮, 论文发表相对集中是不谋而合的。

3\. 论文研究主题聚类分析

仿照《中国索引》对于中国索引研究成果的分类划分, 即索引理论、索引编制、 索引历史与文化、索引新技术与索引软件、索引标准和索引国际化、索引评价与利用等研究领域, 将非索引类期刊发表的323篇索引研究论文也进行研究领域分类, 便得到图10的数据统计和柱形图显示。

在323篇索引研究论文中, 研究索引编纂的论文最多, 一共103篇, 占总数的 31.89%, 接近论文总数的三分之一。同时, 索引编制研究论文在编辑出版学专业期刊、图书馆学情报学专业期刊、大学学报和一般性其他期刊的论文数量细分统计中也都居于前两位, 可见在非索引类期刊中讨论索引如何编纂问题, 是各方关注的焦点, 也是研究者最下气力研究的内容。

相比之下, 位居第二的研究领域是索引评价与利用研究, 论文数量是69篇, 而且在编辑出版学专业期刊、大学学报和一般性期刊中的细分排名中也都居于前两位, 这说明索引评价和利用作为跨界研究议题受到了特别关注。尤其是引文索引的科学评价作用, 关联到很多领域的成果认定和职称晋升, 研究者纷纷刊文发表自己的见解, 也就自然形成了一个较为特殊的研究热点。论文数量最少的是索引 标准与索引国际化研究, 只有12篇论文刊出, 反映出索引领域高端且专业化问题还得回到“索引圈”内探讨, 相关学科的专业人士是无法胜任的。

4\. 论文作者统计分析

在非索引类期刊发表的323篇论文中, 署名作者有301位, 平均每篇论文由1.07位作者完成。具体统计后得知, 独立作者发表的论文共229篇, 占总数的70.9%;合作作者发表论文94篇, 占总数的29.1%。但是非索引类期刊中没有出现集体作者刊发的论文, 这一现象值得进一步研究。

表8 非索引类期刊发表索引研究论文的作者统计表

<table><tbody><tr data-xml-align="center"><td>作者类型</td><td>论文发表数量 (篇)</td></tr><tr data-xml-align="center"><td>独立作者</td><td>229</td></tr><tr data-xml-align="center"><td>合作作者</td><td>94</td></tr></tbody></table>

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.15#TA8)

同样是套用普莱斯定律, 计算得出非索引类期刊的核心作者发文量约等于2.37 。依此数值最终确定的核心作者共7位, 其中平保兴和邱均平发文10篇, 张琪玉发文7篇, 叶继元、陈东辉、毛建军、徐月英各发文3篇。这7位核心作者中, 张琪玉、 平保兴二位先生也是《中国索引》专业期刊的核心作者, 由此可知其研究实力和成果产出效率在中国是数一数二的。武汉大学邱均平教授和南京大学叶继元教授都是索引研究的领军人物, 同时也都担任中国索引学会副理事长, 他们荣登核心作者榜也是实至名归。毛建军、徐月英、陈东辉三位核心作者在古籍索引电子化研究、索引编制研究、国外索引编制研究方面各有建树, 也由此形成了各自的研究特点, 值得其他研究者学习借鉴。

五、量化的总结

1\. 索引编纂量化小结

通过以上统计分析和述评探微, 不难发现中国新世纪的索引编纂成绩可观, 但问题也不少。最需要提高的就是索引编纂数量, 18年来正式出版587部独立的索引著作, 这与世界第一出版大国的称号极不相称。若以中国每年新出版图书35 万种作为基数, 那么587种索引著作只占到万分之0.95!也就是说目前每1.2万种新书中才有一部索引著作名列其中, 这种状况急需改变。

书后索引编纂的进步有目共睹, 数量也在逐渐提升。学术著作的书后索引编制数量已从3%上升到7%, 但上升空间还很大, 需要继续努力。

卷后索引绝大部分以主题索引为主, 编纂难度也较大, 但可以更好地支撑原著检索。针对主题索引和专题索引的分别编纂, 王彦祥先生提出了“综合性主题索引法”, 并以此方法编制了大量年鉴和地方志卷后索引, 即将人名、地名、篇名等专题性索引词纳入主题索引, 作为一个综合性的主题索引进行排序, 目前已成为中国编纂卷后索引的主流。

独立出版的索引著作鲜见主题索引的编纂 (只占总数的12.4%), 绝大多数都是专题索引, 且又以篇目索引最多, 占到索引著作总数的64.4%。这说明索引著作的类型较为单一, 索引多元化发展不足, 今后应重点推动高级实用的主题索引的编纂。

综合考量十几年来中国索引编纂的数量和影响, 笔者遴选出以下索引编纂的代表人物、代表作品及核心出版机构。

书后索引编纂的代表人物是:王彦祥、毋栋、张若舒及其团队, 其编纂的书后索引数量最多, 质量也最好。

索引著作编纂的代表人物有:刘殿爵、邹育理、卢正言、平保兴、林仲湘、傅德华、王彦祥、王有朋, 他们均有重量级的索引著作问世, 影响不可小觑。

新世纪索引编纂之代表作品包括:

《申报索引:1919–1949》, 《申报索引》编辑委员会编, 100余位专家完成的鸿篇巨制, 使用价值高。

《先秦两汉古籍逐字索引丛刊》《魏晋南北朝古籍逐字索引丛刊》, 刘殿爵、陈方正主编, 大型古籍索引, 质量上乘, 名扬海内外。

《中国古籍总目·索引》, 中国古籍总目编委会编, 由书名四角号码索引和著者四角号码索引两部分组成, 是检索古籍的必备索引工具。

《二十世纪中国人物传记资料索引》, 王明根、傅德华主编, 复旦大学历史系资料室编, 潜心挖掘人物资料的专题索引, 篇幅巨大, 示范性强。

《中国索引综录》《〈中国索引综录〉续编》《中国索引系年录:1999—2016》, 卢正言和平保兴主编, 三部相互衔接的索引著作, 全面梳理和著录了中国20世纪至2016年的索引著作, 学术性和资料性兼备。

《鲁迅大全集·索引卷》, 王彦祥主编, 涵盖人名、地名、篇名、机构、撰主著述篇目索引, 索引类型多样, 编纂技术先进。

索引著作的核心出版机构为国家图书馆出版社、中华书局、上海古籍出版社三家, 出版成绩斐然, 社会影响力广泛。

2\. 索引研究量化小结

《中国索引》甫一创刊就成为中国索引研究的第一平台, 其一刊抵群刊, 支撑起中国索引研究和索引传播之大任。2003~2017年《中国索引》刊发索引研究论文总数为411篇, 刊文数量位列前三的是索引编制类、索引理论类、索引新技术和索引软件类研究论文, 从中可以体察到《中国索引》的研究重点突出, 理论联系实际, 且与现代技术紧密结合。

编辑出版学专业期刊、图书馆学情报学专业期刊, 以及大学学报为主的期刊构成了索引研究的第二平台。这些期刊发表的323篇论文中, 研究索引编纂的论文最多, 其次是索引评价与利用研究论文, 说明索引评价和利用作为跨界研究议题受到特别关注, 成为较特殊的研究热点, 但有些偏离索引研究的核心。

对两大平台刊发的论文研究主题合并分析, 可知“索引编制研究”是所有期刊最为关注的话题, 刊文量也最多, 符合作为实学的索引学学科属性。但两个平台的研究侧重点仍然明显, 互补性强。

通过高频词和语义网络图分析可知, “索引”一词是两大平台期刊排名第一的高频词, 处于语义网络的绝对中心。但《中国索引》排名第二位和第三位的高频词是“中国”、“编制”, 与其紧密关联在一起的高频词还有“图书”“地方志”和“ 年鉴”, 实际反映出中国索引研究的三大分支方向。非索引类期刊中“编制”“中国”“引文”“数据库”“古籍”“文献”“检索”“学术”等70个高频词与“索引”一词产生语义关联, 说明这一平台刊发的论文研究覆盖面很广, 涉及到学术研究的方方面面。

两大平台刊发论文的署名作者共556位, 独立作者均占到70%以上。根据普莱斯定律计算并按照论文数量排名, 得出新世纪索引研究的共同核心作者是张琪玉、平保兴、葛永庆、邱均平、叶继元等5位先生。巧合的是这5位核心作者有4位均担任过中国索引学会副理事长, 他们成为核心作者也算是实至名归。

3\. 索引编纂与研究的量化预测

索引编纂的未来预测, 在5~10年内, 中国索引编纂数量将呈现稳步上升态势, 其中学术著作的索引编纂率可望突破10%, 这是基于国家出台的相关规定均支持索引编纂, 未编制索引的著作将限制出版或评奖等措施, 倒逼索引编纂必须提质增量。独立出版的索引著作整体数量上会缓步上升, 重点是主题索引的编纂出版将会大大增加。

索引研究的未来预测, 在中国索引学会大力推动下, 人们对于索引的认识会明显提高, 索引人才也将新人辈出。在这一前提下索引研究将步入快车道, 索引研究论文数量会快速增长, 预计年刊文量会突破50篇。研究成果质量将有所提升, 索引研究领域也将逐渐丰富起来。

Abstract: This paper uses bibliometrics and quantitative methods, focusing on the statistical analysis on China’s index compilation and the quantitative features of index research during the period of 2000–17. This paper firstly expounds the origin and research target, and explains the data source and selection process. Then statistical analysis is carried out on the status and achievements of index compilation in the new century: It is believed that the number and quality of back-of-the-book index compilation in China have increased and improved, and the achievements have been made in the compilation and summary of indexed works published independently. Over the past ten years, although the number of indexed works published is insufficient, the published works have shown their own characteristics in terms of the type of indexing, the indexed object literature, the subject content reflected in the index, and the distribution of index compilers and index publishing units. From the aspect of index quantification research, it is pointed out that Journal of China Society of Indexers, as the first platform for index research, contributes a great deal to the development of China’s index research. Finally, the author summarizes the representative characters and works of index compilation in China in recent years.

Keywords: China Index; index compilation; index research; index achievement; index specialization; quantitative analysis
