## Abstract

_Libris Canadiana_ provides access to Canadian periodicals of historical significance. The centrepiece of the database is the _Annotated Index to Maclean’s, 1905–1976_, but it also includes comprehensive annotated indexes to the _Financial Post_, the _University Magazine_, the _Canadian Bookman_, the _Monetary Times of Canada_, _Massey’s Magazine, Canadian Forum, Everywoman’s World, The Rebel, Descant, Saturday Night_, the _Canadian Magazine_ and the recently added _Canadian Illustrated News_. In this article, the developer and publisher and the principal indexer and editor of _Libris Canadiana_ provide a tour of the content and explain the indexing process.

## Overview

The _Libris Canadiana_ database ([https://www.libris.ca/libris](https://www.libris.ca/libris)) appeared for the first time in 2005, created, hosted and maintained by Gord Ripley at Reference Press, the publisher of Authex Plus, the software which has been used to compile many of the indexes which appear on Libris. Gordon Adshead has been principal indexer since its inception and editor since 2016. Prior to the launch of Libris, several of the indexes had been published as print products or as CD-ROM editions by Reference Press. At a gathering held in 2003 at York University, Toronto, attended by indexers, editors and librarians, it was decided to support the creation of an online service that would include the previously published indexes.

_Libris Canadiana_ is a subscription index to which customers authenticate via IP. As such, it has a potential audience in the hundreds of thousands. Most subscribers are Canadian universities and their registered students, with a smattering of individual researchers and public libraries. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when university libraries were closed, Libris was opened for access by anyone, anywhere. Since September 2020, with most educational institutions reopening, access has again been by subscription only. Subscription prices vary by institution type and size, and have not changed since 2005.

## Database system and tools

Libris presently consists of 13 satellite index databases, each with a slightly different file format. This is not obvious to a user, who sees only a single large database. Processing (re-indexing) _Libris Canadiana_ takes about two hours on a Dell Optiplex 9020 server, and is a multi-stage operation. This can be done nightly, but more commonly re-indexing is scheduled only when new material has been added to one of the databases. Processing concatenates the index files; blind-checks subject headings; and arranges for proper sorting of subheadings, browse-mode indexes and display lists. The number of citation records currently being processed is 255,563. Provision has been made for parallel processing of the data, should the need arise. Internally, citation records are stored in a pseudo-MARC format, for convenience. Libris renders accented characters and diacritics using the ISO 8859-1 code set. Citations, search results and descriptive pages are in English only.

_Libris Canadiana_ was created in Authex, a software package designed for the preparation of newspaper indexes and other special collections. Perhaps the kindest testament to Authex is that it is still being used by a few indexers, almost 40 years after it was developed to run under DOS. It had a proprietary user interface and was quirky in many ways, but it was also easy to use and cheap ($75.00). More to the point from an indexing point of view, it had a sophisticated thesaurus capacity, one which could be tailored to build a thesaurus semi-automatically. Like similar packages it was basically an index-card file, but one with professional-level sorting and formatting built in. Its features made it attractive to newspaper and periodical indexers, who were migrating in the early 1990s from shoeboxes and mainframes to desktop processing. Authex was never a big seller, and its developer did not shift his operations to the Cayman Islands, but it was the precursor of many other tools and ventures, including _Libris Canadiana_.

_Libris Canadiana_ uses a proprietary search engine – Syllabus – which was developed some 30 years ago by Gord Ripley for use in CD-ROM-based online catalogues. At one point during the 1990s more than 1,200 sites (public libraries, law libraries, universities) in Canada were employing Syllabus-based CD-ROMs. Because it was optimized for quick access on CD-ROM, the software now lends itself quite well to searching index databases on modern servers, and it displays citations in _Libris Canadiana_ that are OpenURL-compliant.

## Source material

A key challenge in the creation of the individual indexes compiled for this website has been obtaining continuous runs of source material, usually in original printed volumes or in microform. The indexers have been very fortunate in having the firm commitment of York University Libraries in Toronto and their continuing willingness to regularly provide materials for most of the projects. In fact, in recent years, Libris has been able to sign a formal lending agreement with York University, in effect a partnership which promises to make available for delivery all required materials to home office locations. Other sources of raw material have been the Financial Post Library, the Maclean’s Library, the National Library of Canada, and for the preparation of sample indexes for funding applications, the Stauffer Library at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario.

### Selection of periodicals to be included in Libris Canadiana

Publications under consideration for inclusion in the _Libris Canadiana_ database must meet certain criteria, all of them satisfying a prime focus on Canada: Canadian publishers and editors, and mainly Canadian authorship. Topical coverage should be principally Canadian, or when international in scope, should in some way relate to the effect on Canada. In short, they must be Canadian periodicals of historical significance, reflecting the social, cultural, political and economic life of Canada in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. A principal guide in this process has been Fraser Sutherland’s ([1989](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#core-R11)) _The monthly epic: a history of Canadian magazines_.

## Creation of subject files and indexing process

Thesauri for Libris have been built up over the years as part of the indexing process, always drawn from the source material, rather than constructed beforehand as a large general list of interrelated headings. These files have been edited, corrected, amended and greatly expanded as additional periodicals have been added to the database. At present (2020) the principal thesaurus contains 92,965 terms, not including cross-references. Individual thesauri were created and are still used for some of the early indexes, but it is expected that these will eventually be superseded by a union thesaurus. The main subject file now contains nearly 93,000 records: general and specific terms, personal names, institutional names and place names. Guides in this process include Library and Archives Canada’s Canadian Subject Headings, Library of Congress Subject Headings (online), _The Canadian Encyclopedia_ (online), the 22-volume _Dictionary of Canadian biography/Dictionnaire biographique du Canada_ (online), _Wartime Canada: a window into the Canadian experience during the world wars_ (online), the University of Toronto Catalogue (online), Wikipedia and the ten-volume _Encyclopedia Canadiana_ ([Grolier Society, 1958](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#core-R1)).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup>

The indexing of newspapers and periodicals is quite straightforward. Following the establishment of the appropriate field structure that will accommodate coverage of essential information, it mainly involves the careful reading and understanding of articles and editorials, identifying and entering the applicable subject headings, authors’ full names, titles, illustrations (drawings, photographs, tables, etc.), date and paging, and the composition of descriptive notes. The notes (or brief abstracts) often contain additional information relating to the topic covered in the article (historical, biographical, geographical) in order to provide the user with both a broader perspective and greater detail. In the compilation of these annotations the indexers must not embellish the material found in the magazines, but should always be strictly objective, recording only those ideas and opinions offered by the authors and editors. With Libris and its historical focus on Canadian subjects, it is also helpful if the indexers have a good background knowledge of the material and the time periods covered by the magazines.

## Indexes on Libris Canadiana

_Libris Canadiana_ provides word, title, author and subject access to material published in a number of Canadian periodicals of historical and cultural significance, including _Maclean’s Magazine_, _The Financial Post_, _The Monetary Times of Canada_, _Saturday Night_, _Everywoman’s World_, _Canadian Forum_, _The Rebel_, _Descant_, _The Canadian Magazine_, _Massey’s Magazine_, _The Canadian Bookman_, _Canadian Illustrated News_ and _The University Magazine_. Covering the period 1867–2014, the overall effect is a reflection of the economic, social and cultural life of Canada in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as viewed by some of its finest journalists, editors and literary figures.

Prior to their inclusion online as part of _Libris Canadiana_, the indexes to _Canadian Bookman_, _The University Magazine_ and _Massey’s Magazine_ had been published as print editions (Heggie and McGaughey, [1993](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#core-R5); [1997](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#core-R6); [1998](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#core-R7)).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup>

### The Canadian Bookman

_The Canadian Bookman_ (1909–10, 1915, 1919–39) was a specialized periodical dedicated to the promotion of the literary and artistic culture of Canada, focusing on books and authors, literary criticism, publishing, bookselling and the library profession. Throughout its history the _Bookman_ was able to attract recognized artists, writers, journalists and academics, including E. J. Pratt, A. Y. Jackson, Lawren Harris, Dorothy Livesay, Mary Quayle Innis and Mazo de la Roche. The Canadian Authors’ Association formed a semi-official relationship with the _Bookman_, using its pages to dispense information on annual meetings and public events, defending authors’ rights and lobbying for improved copyright laws. A sample entry from _The Canadian Bookman_ is shown in [Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#F1).

### The University Magazine

_The University Magazine_ was published quarterly in Montreal from December 1901 to April 1920, and from 1901 to 1906 as the semi-annual _McGill University Magazine_. Under the editorship of Sir Andrew Macphail, it became established as one of the foremost journals of thought and opinion in the history of Canadian periodical literature. Producing a magazine ‘of intelligent conservativism’, Macphail advocated a conservative ideology based on the human benefits of rural life, tradition and the imperial order. Contributors who shared the editor’s views included British statesman Arthur Balfour, historian G. M. Wrong, essayist Maurice Hutton and journalist and encyclopedist John Castell Hopkins. Regular contributors were the economist and humorist Stephen Leacock (‘Sunshine sketches of a little town’), the poet Marjorie Pickthall (‘The drift of pinions’) and the physician/poet John McCrae (‘Aux champs de Flandre; In Flanders fields’). A sample entry from _The University Magazine_ is shown in [Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#F2).

### Massey’s Magazine

_Massey’s Magazine_ was published in 18 monthly issues, from January 1896 to June 1897, when it was absorbed by _The Canadian Magazine_. Its stated editorial policy read that it intended to ‘eschew politics, avoid religious controversies, shun questions of race and creed, and constantly endeavour to advance the interests of Canadian literature, science and art’. Writers contributing to the magazine include William Henry Drummond, Charles G. D. Roberts, Bliss Carman, Pauline Johnson and Duncan Campbell Scott. Columns dealt with women’s issues, including suffrage and education. All articles, stories, poems, photographs and artistic decorations are indexed for Libris. A sample entry from _Massey’s Magazine_ is shown in [Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#F3).

### Annotated Index to Maclean’s

The _Annotated Index to Maclean’s, 1905–1976_, compiled and edited by Gordon Adshead, is perhaps the centrepiece of the Libris database. A _Maclean’s_ editorial in the issue for 16 October 1965 states, ‘To tell the Canadian story we have drawn on historians, essayists, politicians, diplomats, spies, actors, painters, scientists, warriors, teachers and as a mainstay, many of the ablest journalists in the land.’ Editors have included Thomas B. Costain, Ralph Allen, Peter Gzowski and Peter C. Newman. Writers whose contributions appear on a regular basis in _Maclean’s_ over the years include Farley Mowat, Margaret Atwood, June Callwood, Mordecai Richler, Robertson Davies and Pierre Berton. The _Maclean’s Index_ is an extensively annotated key to all articles, columns, editorials and literary works. There is selective inclusion of advertisements and illustrations. Special attention is paid to Canadian political and economic events, institutions and personalities at national, provincial and municipal levels, in addition to all articles on education and educators, women’s issues, labour and business, arts and literature, science and technology, sports, recreation and travel. The index includes reviews of books, films, music and drama, with additional indexing of the reviewers. Reproductions of artworks are indexed under the name of the artist, with annotations describing the work and the location of the original. The purpose of the _Maclean’s Index_ is to provide a clear and effective means of approach to the entire contents of this important Canadian magazine from 1905 to 1976. Sample entries from _Maclean’s_ are shown in [Figure 4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#F4).

### The Monetary Times

_The Monetary Times_ began publication on 15 August 1867, just weeks after the birth, on 1 July 1867, of the Dominion of Canada, being the confederation of the British North American colonies of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec. It was not just a financial newspaper which spanned many critical years of Canada’s economic development but also, in its columns and editorials, addressed the social, political, historical and biographical aspects of that development. It was, in its time, the national commercial paper, and continued to be published without interruption for over 100 years.

The _Index to The Monetary Times,_ compiled by Gordon R. Adshead and developed by Reference Press as a CD-ROM product, was later incorporated into _Libris Canadiana_. It provides online author/subject/title access, with descriptive annotation, to all articles and columns, including technical content and trade names. Activities and personalities in commercial corporations, trade unions and public institutions are covered: annual meetings; financial reports; acquisitions and mergers; collective bargaining agreements; appointments to senior positions in business, labour and government. Books about Canada or by Canadian authors are indexed under the general heading ‘Book reviews’, with added subject entries and names of reviewers. General articles about bankrupt firms are indexed under the term ‘Business failures’, the company name and name of the liquidator if available. Company name changes are noticed under the old and the proposed new name. Corporate takeovers or mergers are indexed under each company name, with general headings indicating the branch of industry. A sample entry from _The Monetary Times_ is shown in [Figure 5](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#F5).

### The Financial Post

_The Financial Pos_t was founded in January 1907 by Colonel John Bayne Maclean. The masthead read, ‘A weekly newspaper aiming to present to the public in a popular manner, accurate information relating the financial interests and the legitimate investments of Canada’. His intention was to provide a publication that would serve the financial field, and analyse and interpret all pertinent Canadian business and economic events. Throughout the early years Colonel Maclean’s sense of justice and love of a good fight inspired his editorial policy: the feud with Sir Adam Beck and the monopolistic Ontario Hydroelectric Power Commission, crusades against the Canadian Manufacturers’ Association, Bolshevism in the trade unions and on college campuses. He deplored government interference in business affairs, except in cases where aid was deemed necessary to rescue a failing industry, at which point he would noisily inquire why governments did not move more quickly. From the beginning the emphasis has been on things Canadian, both domestic events and the Canadian perception of international business affairs. Consequently, in the index the majority of citations are of Canadian companies; Canadian business, economic, labour and political matters; and biographies of Canadians.

The _Index to The Financial Post, 1907–1948_, compiled by Gordon R. Adshead, was originally published as a print volume (Micromedia, 1990, 490 pp.) and later joined a growing group of indexes on _Libris Canadiana_. This index has been recently revised, with additional subject approaches and more extensive annotation. There are plans to extend the coverage, from January 1949 to September 1998, when the publication was purchased by Conrad Black’s media organization and became the business pages of the Toronto daily newspaper _National Post._

The _Financial Post Index_ on Libris covers all significant Canadian and international political and economic events; all major articles and columns (signed pieces, lead editorials); biographical, career and obituary information on individuals in the private and public sectors; corporate events (annual meetings, financial reports, company mergers and takeovers, new product announcements); and labour events (conferences, contract settlements, strikes, submissions to governments). A sample entry from _The Financial Post_ is shown in [Figure 6](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#F6).

### Descant

Published from 1970 to 2014, _Descant_ was a quarterly literary magazine that published new and established contemporary writers of poetry, fiction and non-fiction and visual artists in photography, painting and mixed media from Canada and many other countries. Edited by Jane Shen and Karen Mulhallen, it began its life as a mimeograph issued by a group of University of Toronto graduate students for the Graduate English Association. Contributors to _Descant_ include many well-known Canadian authors: Margaret Atwood, Dennis Lee, Michael Ondaatje, Al Purdy, Jane Urquhart, bill bissett, Timothy Findley, Alberto Manguel, Rosemary Sullivan, Evelyn Lau and W. P. Kinsella. Three of _Descant_’s special issues were also published as books: _Views from the North_ ([Mulhallen, 1984](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#core-R8)), _Patria_ ([Schafer, 1991](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#core-R10)) and _Tasks of passion: Dennis Lee at mid-career_ ([Mulhallen et al., 1982](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#core-R9)). For much of its life, the _Descant_ office was located at the historic George Brown House, 50 Baldwin Avenue, in Toronto. The magazine won six Canadian National Magazine Awards and was the recipient of the Writers’ Trust of Canada Journey Prize for fiction in 1995. The _Libris Canadiana Index to Descant, 1970–2014_ (compiled and edited by Gordon Adshead) covers all entries, including poetry, short fiction, excerpts from literary works (novels, collections of short stories), interviews, essays, plays, music scores, drawings, etchings, reproductions of artworks and facsimile pages. A sample entry from _Descant_ is shown in [Figure 7](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#F7).

### Canadian Forum

_Canadian Forum_ was Canada’s oldest continuously published cultural and political periodical, from its beginning in 1920 a platform for the promotion of nationalist and progressive (left-wing) ideas in art, literature, politics and social policy. It originated at the University of Toronto as the offshoot of _The Rebel_ (1917–20), a tiny magazine published by university faculty. Editors of the _Forum_ included Barker Fairley, Northrop Frye, Abe Rotstein, Milton Wilson, Denis Smith and Duncan Cameron. Owned cooperatively for most of its history, it was also published for brief periods by James Lorimer and J. M. Dent, and in the 1930s by Graham Spry and the League for Social Reconstruction. As an artistic and literary publication, it supported the Group of Seven Painters and reproduced the works of Lawren Harris, A. Y. Jackson, Franklin Carmichael, A. J. Casson and many others, as well as poetry and short stories by Margaret Atwood, Irving Layton, Leonard Cohen, Earle Birney and A. J. M. Smith. Politically it was a forum for thinkers such as Frank Underhill, F. R. Scott, Ramsay Cook, Eugene Forsey, Robert Fulford and Mel Watkins.

The _Libris Canadiana Annotated Index to the Canadian Forum, 1920–2000_, compiled by Gordon Adshead, includes coverage of all literary works; essays on politics and economics; biographical articles; reviews of books, theatre and art exhibitions; reproductions of artworks, portrait drawings; and photographs. Excluded are most advertisements, short notices and anecdotal items. Indexing of the _Forum_’s small predecessor, _The Rebel_, is presented as a separate index database. A sample entry from _Canadian Forum_ is shown in [Figure 8](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#F8) and one from _The Rebel_ in [Figure 9](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#F9).

### The Canadian Magazine

_The Canadian Magazine_ was published from March 1893 to April 1939. The founders promoted their publication as one of the leading periodicals in Canada, intending to cover all areas of Canadian politics, society and culture as it would reflect the development of the modern nation of Canada, ‘cultivating Canadian patriotism and Canadian interests’. The annotated index to the magazine which appears on Libris was compiled by Grace Heggie and Anne McGaughey at York University and covers the early volumes, from its inception in 1893 to 1914. Entries include a wide variety of topics and personalities relating to that period: prose and poetry by Canadian writers, art reproductions, Canadian social and economic studies, women’s issues and international relations. Contributors included Lucy Maud Montgomery, Stephen Leacock, Goldwin Smith, William Wilfred Campbell and Katherine Hale. A sample entry from _The Canadian Magazine_ is shown in [Figure 10](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#F10).

### Everywoman’s World

_Everywoman’s World_ was founded in 1913 by Isador Simonski at his Continental Publishing Company in Toronto. Initially conceived as an advertising vehicle targeting women consumers, it evolved into one of Canada’s truly national publications, reaching a circulation of over 100,000 at its peak, most of them educated, middle-class women. It became a prime source of information about contemporary attitudes, consumer behaviour and cultural productions of the era. Authors include Nellie McClung, Lucy Maud Montgomery (her serialized autobiography) and Stephen Leacock. Selected issues from all volumes in the range 1914 to 1923 are included in the index on Libris. A sample entry from _Everywoman’s World_ is shown in [Figure 11](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#F11).

### Saturday Night

Founded in Toronto in 1887 by novelist and journalist Edmund E. Shepherd, _Saturday Night_ in its early volumes represented a defined and influential segment of the Canadian population: upper-middle-class English-speaking Torontonians. _Saturday Night_ intended to provide ‘social intelligence’ to a culturally aware, socially conservative readership, featuring articles on literature, music, art, politics, business and religion. Shepherd retired as editor in 1906, to be succeeded by Joseph T. Clark, and then Frederick Paul, who during the years 1909–26 developed the magazine into a national institution. He was followed by Hector Charlesworth, later chairman of the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (CBC), and Bernard K. Sandwell (1932–51). During later years, two outstanding editors took over the management of _Saturday Night_, Arnold Edinborough (1958–68) and Robert Fulford (1968–87), maintaining a tradition of fine writing and creative journalism.

_Saturday Night_ gave many aspiring Canadian poets, academics and journalists the opportunity to develop their skills and to freely voice their opinions. In the early years these included E. Pauline Johnson, Stephen Leacock, Archibald Lampman, Madge Macbeth, Lucy Maud Montgomery and Marjorie Pickthall. In the mid-twentieth century and subsequent decades, frequent contributors included literary editor Robertson Davies, Margaret Atwood, Hugh Garner, Al Purdy, Heather Robertson, Mordecai Richler, Peter Gzowski, Irving Layton, Eugene Forsey and George Woodcock.

The _Libris Canadiana_ annotated index to the entire run of _Saturday Night_ (December 1987–Winter 2005) provides references to articles and editorials, short stories and poems, book reviews, drama, music and film reviews and artworks of all kinds. A sample entry from _Saturday Night_ is shown in [Figure 12](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#F12).

### Canadian Illustrated News

Published weekly from October 1869 to December 1883 in Montreal by George E. Desbarats, the _Canadian Illustrated News_ will be indexed in its entirety for Libris by Gordon Adshead and is being linked for full-text access to the Canadian Research Knowledge Network. At its inception, Desbarats described his new publication as a paper ‘handsomely illustrated by the wonderful and beautiful process of leggotype’, half-tone photoengravings which had been developed by William A. Leggo. It was to be a newspaper which would ‘reflect Canadian nature, enterprise and art throughout the world’, and by picturing to Canadians ‘the broad dominion they possess, its resources and progress, great men and events’, the _Canadian Illustrated News_ would teach them to feel proud and to love their country. A sample entry from the _Canadian Illustrated News_ is shown in [Figure 13](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#F13).

## Future plans

Those responsible for the creation and maintenance of the Libris website believe in the continuing usefulness of indexes for historical publications and intend to strive to make additions and improvements to achieve this aim. Where necessary, existing indexes on Libris, including the _Index to the Financial Post_, will be revised and extended and the thesaurus will be enhanced in order to accommodate additional titles. Wherever possible, linkages with digitized source materials will be established and full-text access will be provided, as in the case of a recent addition to Libris and a work-in-progress, the _Canadian Illustrated News_, published from 1869 to 1883, for which full text has been provided by the Canadian Research Knowledge Network. Also under discussion for future inclusion in the Libris database are _Canadian Architect and Builder_ (1888–1908), _New Maritimes_ (1982–96), _Prairie Forum_ (1976–2013), _Body Politic: A Gay Liberation Newspaper_ (1971–87), and now, as suggested in a recent review by Margaret de Boer, titles such as C_hatelaine_, _Harrowsmith_ and _Tamarack Review._<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.4#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup>
