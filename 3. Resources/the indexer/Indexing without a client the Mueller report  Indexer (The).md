## Abstract

After the initial flurry of interest, government reports rarely receive the attention they deserve. Often based on detailed research, the information they contain is largely inaccessible, even when published in digital form, due to the lack of indexes. After briefly examining the extent to which such reports _are_ indexed (and why they are usually _not_ indexed), the background to and publication of the much-anticipated Mueller report on Russian interference in the US 2016 election is outlined. The inadequacies of several independently published editions are considered and the case is made for indexing the report, despite not having been commissioned to undertake this task. The indexing process is outlined, especially dealing with the metatopic, Donald Trump, and the redacted sections, and possible future developments are suggested. The online index is available at [https://www.muellerreportindex.net](https://www.muellerreportindex.net/).

In the summer of 2019, I decided to index the Mueller report – a much-anticipated government document that had just appeared without an index. I did this unsolicited, ‘on spec’, without a publisher client. The report did not appear to be getting the attention it deserved. Being largely unreadable as a whole (though quite fascinating in parts), it was perishing from neglect; an index would make it more accessible.

## Personal indexing

There is a small tradition of privately conceived indexes. The Andy Warhol _Diaries_ was originally published without an index, but one soon appeared in _Spy_ magazine. Later, the publisher issued an authorized index in a new printing. An unauthorized index was created for the _Pentagon Papers_, which was itself unauthorized. The yearly _Index_ of the _New York Times_ was itself not indexed across the years, and when an index appeared, the _Times_ sued. This case was decided in favour of the indexer.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.6#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> Some books of current political interest are appearing without indexes, notably Michelle Obama’s and Joe Biden’s memoirs, no doubt victims of the ‘Washington read’ (‘the perusal of a book in a bookstore that consists of checking the index for references to oneself and reading only those parts of the book’<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.6#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup>).

## Government reports: indexing and lack of indexing

Government reports are sometimes indexed. Annual reports by government agencies in Australia are required to have an index. A recent issue of _The Indexer_ included a detailed analysis of these ([Russell and McMaster, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.6#core-R4)), and the Australian and New Zealand Society of Indexers (ANZSI) has published a guide to indexing annual reports ([Russell and McMaster, 2010](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.6#core-R3)). Other articles in _The Indexer_ on indexing government information mostly focus on parliamentary proceedings, not on reports, while McClung ([2010](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.6#core-R1)) focused on a comparison of print versus Web indexes.

In the UK, the Scott report on the ‘Arms-to-Iraq’ inquiry (1996) may be the only example of a government report that has been indexed (by a small team of Society of Indexers members under conditions of strict security).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.6#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup> However, in a 2001 House of Lords debate on the cost and style of government publications, Lord Phillips of Sudbury asked ‘whether they will in future require all departmental and other governmental reports to carry indexes’. The response of the government minister was, not surprisingly, that ‘the inclusion of indexes and contents pages is a matter of good practice, but speed of production often prevents their inclusion’,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.6#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup> and it appears that there has been no action since then. A quick online search of several UK government reports did not show any with indexes.

In the United States, some important and popular government reports have been indexed:

•

_Warren Commission Report_ – An 888-page book (plus 26 volumes of testimony) on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Several indexes have been created. The official one is just a name index with about 200 page references to Lee Harvey Oswald, and similar flaws. At least four other indexes then appeared. Sylvia Meagher’s 1966 index is among the most interesting. It comprises three separate indexes, intensely analysed, but is typed and not searchable.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.6#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup>

•

_Pentagon Papers_ – not an official publication, 7,000 pages. Several indexes were privately produced. One is by Charlotte Karrlsson-Willis, assisted by Wendy Valdes. There were two versions of the _Papers_. This index indexes both, with different page numbers, in columns side by side.

•

_Starr Report_ – on President Bill Clinton’s affair with an intern. There is no official index but a totally whacko index was published in _Starr Report disrobed_.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.6#fn6" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn6">6</a></sup>

•

_9/11 Commission report on terrorist attacks upon the United States_. Released on 22 July 2004, 567 pages. The government report is admirably lucid and bears a formidable textual apparatus, including 115 pages of endnotes. But it lacked an index. This was publicly noticed by the magazine _n+1_, which assembled a team of indexers. The new index by Christian Lorentzen and Keith Gessen appeared in September 2004.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.6#fn7" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn7">7</a></sup>

There are a number of reasons why government reports might not be indexed:

•

the ‘Washington read’ (see above)

•

difficulty in agreeing on a standard

•

partisan desire to smother a report in complexity

•

complexity of the subject matter

•

complexity of the printed hierarchy

•

existence of a table of contents deemed to be sufficient

•

existence of a glossary deemed to be sufficient

•

desire for speed in publishing (all six editions of the Mueller report seem to have appeared on the same day, 18 April 2019).

## The Mueller report

The work that I indexed, the _Report on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election by Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III_, is referred to here by its short-form title, the Mueller report ([Mueller, 2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.6#core-R2)). The investigation began with indications that Russian interests were interfering in US politics and the 2016 presidential campaign by posing as US persons on social media, and by hacking political campaign sites. Further information prompted the FBI to open an investigation on 31 July 2016 into whether individuals associated with the Trump campaign were coordinating with the Russian government in its interference activities.

This investigation continued into the presidency of Donald Trump. On 17 May 2017, the acting Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, appointed Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel to continue the investigation. Mueller led a team of 30 or so FBI lawyers and aides over the next 22 months, and reported back to the then Attorney General, William Barr, on 22 March 2019.

Framing the report was done in a rush in the final months. How the process played out is recounted by a key member of the special counsel team, Andrew Weissmann, in a revelatory book, _Where law ends: inside the Mueller investigation_ ([2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.6#core-R5)). Barr looked over the report and redacted many passages in it. There are various reasons for redactions, discussed below. Perhaps 7 per cent of the text is blacked out. Some pages are completely blacked out except for footnote numbers. Not only that, but on 24 March Barr pre-emptively released a letter to Congress that in parts contradicted Mueller’s own executive summary. This caused confusion in Congress and among the public when they finally did see the report, which was released to Congress on 18 April 2019. The report was initially released as an image PDF, unsearchable and unprintable, but technical wizards rapidly extracted from it a searchable and printable PDF. HTML and Word versions have also been created.

With remarks like ‘Because we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw ultimate conclusions’, it appeared that the report was unwilling to commit, and large swathes of the political class quickly lost interest. One presidential impeachment came and went (about a phone call to Ukraine) and the Mueller report was barely referred to. Yet the report has held our attention, despite the passage of time. At least six publishers rushed to publish it; being a government publication it is free of copyright. Hundreds of thousands of copies have been sold. At the time of writing (November 2020) there is still interest. One side has charged that there was no valid reason to start an investigation in the first place. Others believe that the facts when laid out point to high crimes and misdemeanours which are indictable or impeachable.

In summary, the report is a well-researched, highly detailed, logically argued and still relevant document of 448 pages, lacking one important element – an index. The first release was not even searchable, but that was quickly remedied. Yet online searching is a crude tool. To be effective, the Mueller report has needed an index.

## Indexing the Mueller report

After deciding to index the report, I took stock. I had much experience indexing large political tomes, notably historical works and presidential biographies. I could well conceive of this work as a job assignment. I set a deadline for myself, and a work schedule; I even imagined a price I would likely charge if it had been a sponsored index.

Before starting, I investigated the six editions of the Mueller report that had been published by the following organizations:

•

Scribner (a branch of Simon & Schuster)<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.6#fn11" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn11">11</a></sup>

•

Thirteenth Colony Press (Sastrugi Press).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.6#fn13" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn13">13</a></sup>

I also looked around to see if anybody else had proposed an index. Several journalists had been looking over the report, but it seemed they were mostly interested in guessing what was under the redactions.

Of the six editions, one is totally digital (from the New York Times). The other publishers made a choice: whether to try to make the report easier reading by moving footnotes to the back matter and renumbering the pages, or whether to keep the Department of Justice layout and page numbering, and perhaps superimpose a new numbering for the publisher’s own new editorial material. The latter is the better choice for fostering compatibility between researchers.

Most of the editions contain some additional material or ‘apparatus’. One edition, however, was proud of having no apparatus at all, stating, ‘It is the report and nothing but the report, presented as released by the Attorney General of the United States, with no positioning or framing apparatus – such as a celebrity introduction – that would give it bias or impede its clarity.’

One apparatus that definitely was needed and not supplied was an index. To be fair: two editions, the New York Times and Carlile Media, made attempts at indexing. The New York Times online edition has a list of ‘References to’ tags on each page, which can be searched. A typical page entry is:

> Vol. 1, Page 9.
> 
> References to: Clinton campaign \* Clinton, Hillary \* Cohen, Michael D. \* Flynn, Michael T. \* Joseph Mifsud \* Kislyak, Sergey L. \* Papadopoulos, George \* Russian hacking \* Russian social media manipulation \* Trump Tower Moscow \* Trump campaign \* WikiLeaks.
> 
> (Incidentally, the name ‘Joseph Mifsud’ should read ‘Mifsud, Joseph.)

The Carlile Media edition is machine-made but ‘manually curated’. Index references are not to the original pagination, but to a new numbering. The headnote states, ‘Certain individuals, places, and entities referenced continually throughout this report – such as President Donald J. Trump, Washington D.C., or the F.B.I. – have been omitted from this index.’ The first few headings are shown in [Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.6#F1).

The other four editions have no index at all.

Out of the six editions, I decided to work with the Washington Post version, published by Scribner (an imprint of Simon & Schuster.) This uses two page-numbering schemes: the first, the original page number of the Department of Justice, appearing centered at the foot of the page; the second, invented by Scribner, appearing in the outer corner of the page. The apparatus is extensive, which was a plus, though I did not intend to index it.

For the sake of publicity, I prepared small index samples in December 2019: the A B C lines of an index, and a sample of the X Y Zs, and also a sample ‘Trump Tower Moscow’ subject index. These sample indexes were made for the purposes of enticing readers and interesting future publishers. The main writing of the index began in May 2020, and the index was ready in June. A selective release was sent to some professional indexers and received much acclaim. A website was created and the Mueller report index was formally published online on 12 July 2020. The official name of the index website ([muellerreportindex.net](http://muellerreportindex.net/)) is rather easy to remember (and hopefully easy for search engines to find). It contains the index itself, a link to the report, and various items of explanatory material about how to use the two together.

## Structure of the Mueller report

The official report is in two volumes. Volume I is divided into five major sections, each outlining a particular offence or subject of investigation, while Volume II is in four sections. In [Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.6#F2) the titles of the sections are shortened.

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2021.6/asset/5489cb0a-8386-4cd1-9020-f2fc06c989a5/assets/graphic/indexer_2021_6_fig2.jpg)

Figure 2. Part of the table of contents of the Mueller report

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.6#F2)

The sections are only loosely connected to each other, so the text does not flow smoothly from one section to the next. The report ends with the often-quoted ‘no person in this country is so high that he is above the law’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.6#fn14" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn14">14</a></sup>

The four appendices are somewhat removed from the narrative. Appendix B is a highly useful thumbnail summary of persons and entities, about 200 in all. These appendices were also indexed.

The text of the two volumes is organized into sections and subsections down to a maximum of six levels, so a typical reference in an index could conceivably read

Sessions, Jeff, I.V.C.4.b.vi

meaning Volume I, Section V, Subsection C, etc.

This would be very cumbersome as an index locator and might explain the omission of an index. The sections and subsections are named in a detailed table of contents, the existence of which may have been another reason for the special counsel authors and the later six publishers to omit an index.

## Indexing method

Since this index had no client, the usual hard copy and digital manuscripts were not made available to the indexer. Therefore a copy of the printed book was purchased for the purpose of mark-up. A PDF of the report created by CNN supplied the digital source.

As a way of working, the plan was to take advantage of every aid. The initial idea was to take the table of contents and permute the headings. As an example, a significant portion of the investigation was into a hotel to be built in Moscow known as ‘Trump Tower Moscow’. The partial table of contents covering this topic is shown in [Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.6#F3):

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2021.6/asset/9aa1a98a-5e9b-42b5-b6a7-c2707c238a28/assets/graphic/indexer_2021_6_fig3.jpg)

Figure 3. Part of the table of contents relating to Trump Tower Moscow

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.6#F3)

After permutations and some rewording, one winds up with index entries:

> Cohen, Michael: invited to Russia, I.76–78
> 
> Russia: travel to: invitations to Trump and Cohen, I.78
> 
> Trump, Donald J. (as Candidate): invited to Russia, I.78
> 
> Trump Organization: in Moscow, I.67
> 
> Trump Tower Moscow Project, I.67–80

These lines can be selected from the table of contents of the digital report, and copied and pasted into a data field of an indexing program. An even more mechanical approach would be KWIC (Keyword in Context) indexing, an approach rooted in the past and still useful.

After going through the table of contents, I noted that Appendix B, the glossary, is a helpful list of persons and organizations, each with a one- or two-sentence description. Grabbing the names from the glossary is a great help in reducing keystrokes, verifying proper spelling of names and establishing their proper identities. The existence of the glossary might have been another reason for the authors not to make a real index.

Another attempted worksaver was to look at the ‘References to’ tags of the one digital edition (that of the New York Times). However, it appeared that only the most significant subjects were chosen, up to about a dozen per page, so these lists could only be used as a cross-check (and in fact were not used).

By this point I had the main entries, and about 800 lines of index. Now I turned to the text itself. Some topics in the Trump Tower Moscow section were:

> alternative channels: Putin with G. W. Bush, I.79
> 
> Miss Universe Pageant (2013), I.67–68
> 
> Trump, Ivanka, I.69

### The main heading

The main heading is obviously Trump, appearing on every page, perhaps. There has been a trend towards omitting the metatopic (the main subject) of a publication in the index, but I am strongly in favour of keeping it. This cluster of subjects was dealt with as shown in [Figure 4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.6#F4).

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2021.6/asset/e01e97b9-9243-4962-85f0-ff2c11a468f2/assets/graphic/indexer_2021_6_fig4.jpg)

### Handling of redacted text

Redaction was a new concept to many readers. There were four types of redactions in the report, which are printed over the black redaction markings:

•

GRAND JURY – information obtained via grand-jury testimony, customarily shielded from later disclosure

•

HARM TO ONGOING MATTER – potential impact on related cases

•

INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUE – such as spy or surveillance techniques

•

PERSONAL PRIVACY – of unindicted peripheral individuals.

These sections were indexed as ‘Grand Jury: redactions, I.194’, etc. Eventually, these passages will be unredacted, when the reason for redaction is no longer relevant. Then they will be indexed. Redacting can create pages reminiscent of a crossword puzzle. When the report was translated into various formats – txt, pdf, html, etc. – it must have been a challenge to maintain the page breaks of the original.

## Index content and statistics

The Mueller report index includes every significant person, organization and topic discussed in the report. It is valid for the three editions of the report that use the official Department of Justice page numbering. Some thought has been given to repaginating the index to work for the other three editions.

The finished index has 2,484 lines at 40 characters per line. It has about 2,760 references. Normally such an index would be attached to the report as a back-of-the-book index. Lacking this, the index can be printed as a thin pamphlet that can be read side by side with a printed report.

The index is also now available as a digital publication on the website [muellerreportindex.net](http://muellerreportindex.net/), where the index and the report can be seen in two PDF windows, side by side. To use the index for research, a third window for a word processor, such as MS Word or Notepad, can be set up.

To use the website in this way, the following procedure can be used:

•

In the index find a topic of interest and its page locators.

•

Go into the report. For each locator, position the report on that page, referring to the page number visible at the bottom of the page.

•

Relevant text can be copied and pasted into the word processor window, together with any researcher comments.

•

Features of a PDF reader, such as search, can also be used.

•

The user can then return to the index or the report and continue researching.

## Publishing and publicity

The index has been distributed widely in circles of indexers and editors, in particular in the discussion groups ASI-L, IDG, INDEX-L and EFADiscussionList. The index was wrapped in a WIX website, which was released on 14 July 2020. A limited paper output has been made, and copyrighted. Sales and donations may be accessed through the website. Adjustments may be made to the content and functioning of the index, but the current index will always be available through the website address [muellerreportindex.net](http://muellerreportindex.net/), which is gradually being found by search engines.

## The future

Will the work on this index ever be ‘finished’? This is a question familiar to indexers. Further developments will include both a printed book and an ebook. Information in redacted passages will be added to the index as it becomes available.

The aim is to make the information contained in the report widely accessible. To this end, the index is being promulgated privately by email, with the crucial link ([https://www.muellerreportindex.net/](https://www.muellerreportindex.net/)) embedded. If people forward it to friends and colleagues, the link will go with those messages. Ultimately, I hope to place the index with a responsible publisher or not-for-profit organization that can nourish and publicize it.

The next goal is to tightly link the index to the report so that clicking on a page reference will bring the reader immediately to the relevant page or location in the report. The two documents will remain open side by side through the course of reading. In fact, this is similar to the functionality that already exists in the present website.

At the time of writing, more Web development is planned. Presently the app is coded within a WIX-built website, which has pluses and minuses, permitting fast development but with limited potential. When recast, this index will be a model for indexes and a new way of reading books with active indexes.
