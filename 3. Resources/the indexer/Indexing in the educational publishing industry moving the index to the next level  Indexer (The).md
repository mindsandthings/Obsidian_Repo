## Abstract

Do educational publishers still consider indexes to be important tools for information access in their products? Based on a survey of managing editors at multinational publishing houses in South Africa, they do care about indexes but only to a limited extent. The editors hire qualified indexers, but they offer relatively low pay rates and do not include indexes in books at primary-school level. While these findings could be dismaying, Deon Schutte instead finds it heartening that publishers are committed to including indexes in traditional media. He suggests that the next step could be for indexers to offer publishers new ways to create visually appealing, user-friendly indexes for readers of all ages and for books in all formats.

## Introduction

[Sam Leith (2017)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#core-R9) wrote, ‘Bad indexes are legion. Absent indexes almost more so.’ This leads one to question whether indexes in books are still relevant and needed today. In preparation for the 2021 conference of the Association of Southern African Indexers and Bibliographers (ASAIB), it was time to do a little investigation into whether the publishers of educational material still considered indexing and indexes as important tools for information access in their products.

## Quō vādis, Index?

It is probable that most people will not remember the first time that they encountered an index. I remember being in primary school, probably grade 4 (ten years old), and my parents had just purchased the _Nuwe Afrikaanse Kinderensiklopedie_ (New Afrikaans Encyclopedia for Children). With great excitement the first delivery was fetched from the post office – volume 1 and the index. What a clever way to ensure that parents remain committed to purchasing the whole set!

A child who discovers that the index of a book (or a series!) is the key that unlocks the knowledge that hides within the many pages of the book has entered a world of information without boundaries. This discovery of the index fuelled my curiosity and led to many happy hours spent in the school library, searching for the topics that were yet to be delivered in the subsequent volumes of our new encyclopedia.

The use of encyclopedias may be fading into distant memory as students and adults alike consider Google searches the be all and end all of topical and subject searches. Along with that, somehow, the skills that we once had – the ability to search for reliable, relevant and authoritative information from trusted sources – seem to fade. Who is to blame for lack of information literacy skills is a topic for another discussion. Are we going to let the index follow the same demise?

It seems that it is hard to find _publishers_ per se – they don’t really have opinions that they like to share; they would rather point you in the direction of the _managing editor._ The role of managing editor at publishers involves the control of the editorial process that any manuscript goes through when it is prepared for print. As such, the managing editor is the project manager who ensures that the manuscript is published in time, on budget and in line with the publishing house’s editorial guidelines.

A questionnaire was sent to eight respondents who work in educational publishing at prominent multinational publishing houses in South Africa. Five responses were received. So did we learn from this exercise?

### When was the last index commissioned?

[Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#F1) shows when indexes were last commissioned or created for an educational title by the editors. None of the respondents indicated that they ever generate indexes in-house, or that they use software to generate concordances of keywords from the manuscript.

The responses show us that publishing of educational material is cyclical. When the government calls for submissions of new textbooks to align with updated curricula there is more work available for indexers. In South Africa curricula are usually (but not as a rule) updated every five to ten years. This involves the Department of Education releasing updated curricula and requesting that publishers submit new and/or updated editions of learner books, teachers’ guides and workbooks. These titles are submitted to a selection panel for consideration to be included in a national catalogue from which schools or colleges (not universities) may select when purchasing educational material for teaching.

Times between submissions are occupied with reprint corrections and the development of digital content that supplements the material that has previously been published. Often new projects are established, but it is unclear at this moment whether these provide work opportunities for our indexers.

### Educational level

It is interesting that no material at primary level was commissioned (as illustrated in [Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#F2), which records the educational level of the books that included indexes). This may be a good time to develop information-seeking skills in students and it is important to note that, even at a young age, children often expect a book to have an index ([Williams and Bakewell, 1999](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#core-R14)).

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2022.4/asset/a96f2adf-cab1-494a-9071-69514f8f454f/assets/graphic/indexer_2022_4_fig2.jpg)

Worth noting is that young searchers have unique information needs and that traditional indexing methods may not address these ([Williams and Bakewell, 1999](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#core-R14); [Nesset, 2016](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#core-R11)). It is important to note the cognitive development and reading skills of students in this age bracket; for example, some students find learning the alphabetic sequence of letters very difficult and typographical tools could be used to assist with this (such as using bold type and the addition of other visual clues).

### Indexer qualifications and professional memberships

It was encouraging that qualified indexers were commissioned (as illustrated in [Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#F3)). However, it would be interesting to learn what the indexers’ qualifications were. Did they hold qualifications that are subject specific, and/or were they qualified in library and information science? [Frame’s study (1996](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#core-R3); [1997](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#core-R4)) in the UK was interesting in this respect, showing that 47.2 per cent of indexers, although they were members of the Society of Indexers (SI), were neither registered nor accredited by the Society. In the present study, while qualifications were desired and preferred, few publishers knew exactly _what_ the qualifications of the indexers were, or whether they belonged to a professional association (see [Figure 4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#F4)). A study done by [Diodato and Gandt (1991)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#core-R1) showed that qualified indexers, through their training and experience, were able to provide better quality indexes than unqualified indexers (and authors).

### Briefing the indexer

Disconcertingly, it transpires that most indexers are found via word of mouth or colleague referrals and few editors met with indexers to brief them on requirements (see [Figure 5](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#F5)). In [Frame’s (1997)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#core-R4) study, editors indicated that they felt loyal towards indexers who have the required subject knowledge and experience.

### Remuneration: indexing rates and inflation

Page rates are determined by the publishing company with little room for negotiation. It will be interesting to hear the experiences of indexers who work with publishers in this regard. [Frame (1997)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#core-R4) notes that most often indexers get paid according to experience and that task complexity plays a big role in determining payment. In South Africa the ASAIB recommends that the indexer is paid between 25 and 45 rands per page (equivalent to £1.26–2.22), depending on the type of manuscript that is indexed. This, when compared to the page rates that indexers were paid in 2016 in the US (averaging nearly $4) or were recommended (in 2021) in the UK (£2.95), is very low.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup>

Responses to whether the indexer was remunerated well for the volume of work involved were varied. As illustrated in [Figure 6](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#F6), most respondents did not think that indexing rates have kept up with inflation, and not one of them believed the work was remunerated well. This is concerning. It is hard to foresee professionals wanting to do this type of work if remuneration is not commensurate with the volume, intensity, dedication and quality of work that are required by an educational title.

### Index quality

Four respondents agreed that they were happy with the quality of work that was delivered. One respondent elected not to opine on this question. Overall, editors reported that working with freelance indexers was a positive and rewarding experience, generally finding them professional and efficient and rarely giving any trouble.

### The need for indexes

The best news from this research is that all the respondents agreed that indexes are necessary (see [Figure 7](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#F7)).

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2022.4/asset/2294d14c-d188-4fd5-8fef-089f425d0624/assets/graphic/indexer_2022_4_fig7.jpg)

### Editorial policy on indexing

The publisher’s editorial policy guides all (or most) aspects of the standards and care applied to manuscripts, so it was interesting to note that most respondents were unsure whether they had a policy about indexes (see [Figure 8](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#F8)).

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2022.4/asset/b430800c-13c6-4254-8f34-5727d76f41c1/assets/graphic/indexer_2022_4_fig8.jpg)

This is interesting! Somebody just left the door open for new ideas!

### Index features

This can be seen in the responses to the next question, about what editors would like to see in an index (see [Figure 9](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#F9)).

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2022.4/asset/f79ebbe5-e893-4be4-a45a-a32c48192fdd/assets/graphic/indexer_2022_4_fig9.jpg)

The last point on the chart is most poignant: this managing editor felt that they needed the indexer to compile a ‘\[u\]ser-friendly, comprehensive, completed index that doesn’t require input from the publisher’. This makes one wonder whether this respondent really only includes the index because the reader wants it and probably, given the option, would leave it out.

[Lennie (2010)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#core-R10) notes that the unappealing and visually uninspired index can still be a hindrance to the reader finding the information that they need. Publishers (and indexers) can consider the implementation of colours and graphical representations in indexes. This is not a new tool that the publisher could use. [Russell and Dearnley (2017](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#core-R13): 109) discovered that illustrated/illustrative indexes can be found in use as far back as the 1950s. This is a useful tool for young learners to grasp the concept of the index in the same way that we colour sections or chapters in learners’ books. In ebooks this can be useful as hyperlinking allows for ‘touch-and-jump’ icons/graphics that take the reader to the relevant text, or the enrichment of texts with audiovisual material ([Russell and Dearnley, 2017](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#core-R13): 110)

In his article ‘Ebooks and the future of indexing(---ers)’, Steve [Ingle (2015)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#core-R7) notes (with tight reference to ebooks) that publishers are ignorant about indexes and indexing. (How many of us have accessed ebooks to find that the contents page is hyperlinked, but the index is dead and requires manual browsing back to page number X?) And he lays the responsibility for this before the door of the indexer. Why is that? Simply because the indexer is waiting for the customer to tell them what they need to do. Indexers need to show the publisher what value the indexer can provide both now (with traditional media) and in the future (as ebooks gain more traction, or not).

What novel ways of indexing can indexers come up with? How can we innovate? Have we considered including folksonomies in our indexes? (Do publishers even know what a folksonomy is?) [Du Preez (2015](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#core-R2): 35), quoting [Goh (2012)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#core-R5) and [Hedden (2008)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#core-R6), describes folksonomies as ‘folk taxonomies’ that are not created by experts, but by authors as well as ordinary users. Folksonomies can be controlled vocabularies ([du Preez, 2015](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#core-R2): 29). How can an indexer work with the author, editor and proofreaders to develop an appropriate controlled vocabulary of folksonomies for inclusion in the index? Possibly by simply allowing each of these contributors to the publishing project to highlight words, keywords and terms that are current, fashionable and relevant to the subject matter that will be indexed.

It is necessary to investigate whether folksonomies, in tandem with other controlled vocabularies, can provide the user with the best possible access points to the information that they seek.

Participatory indexes may become a reality for digital texts. [Leblanc (2020)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#core-R8) notes that participatory indexing allows users of a digital library to add descriptors based on controlled vocabularies to digital content. However, with the advent of collaborative work in the cloud (such as the Office365 and Google applications) this may also be an option for indexers of traditional formats).

Can we use simple taxonomy structures (the hierarchical classification and organizing of terms; see [du Preez, 2015](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#core-R2): 32) instead of traditional indexes to illustrate or develop conceptual frameworks or knowledge maps and to develop the comprehension of the conceptions of different disciplines? It is worth noting how children can miss information as it can be ‘hidden’ by subheadings ([Williams and Bakewell, 1999](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#core-R14): 175), but this could be corrected by simple taxonomical structures, as illustrated in [Figure 10](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#F10).

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2022.4/asset/91a4f659-3728-46bd-b6a9-b803ceef62b6/assets/graphic/indexer_2022_4_fig10.jpg)

### Publisher–indexer relations

Lastly, the final question: please reflect on your experiences in dealing with indexers.

How do you think this relationship can be improved?

•

‘Primarily a good and interesting experience.’

•

‘Indexes tend to come at the end of a project, so is often regarded as a secondary, last-minute feature, which I think should change. Indexers often _offer fantastic insights as they engage with content on a meaningful level!_.’

•

‘There isn’t time to engage with the indexer. The index needs to be done properly and sent to the publisher for a quick check.’

•

‘Haven’t had problems before.’

•

‘Most indexers that I know also proofread or edit. It is useful to have this two-in-one function, but I’m concerned that the indexing isn’t of the highest quality.’

## Reflection

Indexers love indexes. It is heartening to realize that publishers still feel committed to the inclusion of indexes for traditional media. However, it seems that digital versions of books deserve some consideration, both by indexers, who need new skills to keep up with technology, such as embedded indexing, and publishers, who think indexes are not important in this format. How do indexers feel about working with publishers?<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup>

And finally – a final word to our colleagues in the publishing industry (with a nod and ‘thanks!’ to [Judith Pascoe, 2012](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.4#core-R12)): please hire a professional indexer – authors are the worst indexers!
