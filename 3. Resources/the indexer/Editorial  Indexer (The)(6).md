Publication: The Indexer: The International Journal of Indexing

Volume 38, Number 3

As I write this, COVID-19 restrictions are gradually being lifted where I live in Australia. This is happening for my colleagues all over the world, and we have all been affected in some way or other by the interesting times that we live in. A sincere thank you to the authors who have contributed to this issue, reviewers who have looked at their work, and the staff at our publisher, who have all persevered to bring you this issue. Despite the seemingly endless time available to us living in isolation, it has not always been easy to focus on work and keep to our usual routines. I hope that by the time this issue reaches you, we will all be feeling safer and more adjusted to the new ‘normal’, whatever that may be.

Sadly, many of our professional conferences have been cancelled this year. You may have noticed the last-minute notices about this on the Calendar page of the last issue. Conference presentations and reports are a rich source of content for _The Indexer_, and consequently it may be more of a challenge to find articles on issues of interest to professional indexers over the next year. So in the meantime, if you have been pondering a topic for a presentation, or working on a challenging project, or discover a fascinating index that you think worthy of an article, please do not hesitate to contact me. However, there is some hope. Thanks to the organizers of the National Indexing Day (NID) event in the UK and the American Society for Indexing (ASI) conference in the United States, who opted to take their meetings online, we are able to bring you reports on those events in this issue. The NID event showcased the power of social media to get the word out about indexing, and the ASI conference attracted a large international audience. Please have a look at these trailblazing efforts. While I hope that we will be able to meet again in person soon, it seems to me that virtual events of these types could be a welcome addition to the conference schedule in future and offer us yet more ways to stay in touch across the globe. And on that international note, please have a look at the advertisement for the ICRIS Triennial Meeting and International Indexing Conference in this issue. The conference will be hosted by the Society of Indexers, Deutsches Netzwerk der Indexer, and Nederlands Indexers Netwerk in October 2021 in Berlin, and the organizing committee is hopeful that this conference will proceed as planned.

This issue has developed a rather technical theme. In addition to reports on virtual events, you will find several articles on applied topics, including facet analysis, active ebook indexes, and embedded indexing. Vanda Broughton offers us a fascinating report on her research project on faceted classification at University College London. Those interested in methodologies for building controlled vocabularies will find this particularly interesting. Jan Wright and I return with the third part in our series on how ebook reader applications handle active indexes. This time we explore apps on tablet computers. Then, Walter Greulich continues his series on embedded indexing using Microsoft Word with an explanation of how to edit entries and make the work easier with macros.

If you find the nitty-gritty of indexing methods and tools heavy going, I suggest you head to Christopher Pipe’s report on Margaret Bird’s epic 32-year project transcribing and indexing the manuscript diary of Mary Hardy, the wife of a Norfolk farmer and brewer. It is rare to see such commitment to an index, and I salute Margaret for her dedication to making this valuable document an accessible part of the historical record. And if you are really in need of a break after that, I recommend Dawn Dobbins’s lovely article on how taking a step back reinvigorated her indexing career and improved her work–life balance. This piece could not have come at a better time, as we all gradually emerge from our pandemic bubbles. A special thank you to Dawn for sharing her personal experiences with us. I, for one, plan to take a leaf out of her book and give myself time ‘to withdraw from the cares which will not withdraw from us’ (to borrow her quote from Maya Angelou). As always, Indexes Reviewed makes for interesting reading, and Alberto Cevolini finishes this issue off with a review of Randolph Head’s book on early modern methods of knowledge management.

I wish you all safe passage, and I hope that reading _The Indexer_ will be at least one positive and comforting activity in these strange and unsettling times.
