## Abstract

All Australian Commonwealth annual reports presented to the Federal Parliament are mandated to include both an alphabetical index and a list of requirements to aid access. The authors analysed all 175 Commonwealth government department and agency annual reports produced for the 2016–17 financial year to see how well they met the aids-to-access and devised usability criteria. This investigation examined the alphabetical indexes, specifically areas around layout, quality of indexing, depth of indexing and indexing style. Two-thirds of the Commonwealth annual-report indexes were deemed satisfactory. A checklist was also developed for departments and agencies to check the usability of the alphabetical index in their annual reports.

## Introduction

Most people around the world associate annual reports exclusively with the corporate sector, and Australia is no different. In this paper, however, we look at government annual reports. Australia mandates through its federal structure that all government departments and agencies operating at a national level, and in the states and territories, produce an annual report for presentation to the relevant parliament. Other countries have similar requirements.

Government annual reports fill three major functions:

•

They provide a snapshot of the government department or agency, including information about its people, activities and financial performance during the past financial year.

•

They are designed for specific audiences. In particular, the relevant minister and the parliament, but also the organization’s staff as well as interested stakeholders, such as the media and citizens.

•

They also act as an archive providing a historical public record of the organization.

Where Australia seems to be unique, at least amongst English-speaking nations, is that it mandates the inclusion of an alphabetical index and a list of requirements (formerly known as a compliance index) in all annual reports presented to the Federal (Commonwealth) Parliament. The list of requirements states that entries must provide access to important topics such as the annual performance statement, corporate governance, external scrutiny, report on financial performance and management of human resources.

The specifications for the presentation of annual reports by non-corporate Commonwealth entities are explained in Section 17AJ of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Rule [2014](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.17#core-R3) (Compilation No. 18, 23 August 2017) (‘the Rule’):

> 17AJ Aids to access
> 
> For the purposes of paragraph 17AD(h), the aids to access that must be included in the annual report for the entity are the following:
> 
> (b)
> 
> an alphabetical index of the contents of the report (including any appendices);
> 
> (c)
> 
> a glossary of any abbreviations and acronyms used in the report;
> 
> (d)
> 
> the list of requirements as set out in Schedule 2 to this rule.

To confirm Australia’s uniqueness in requiring alphabetical indexes in Commonwealth annual reports, the annual-report index requirements for a selection of overseas governments and international organizations were investigated (see [Table 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.17#T1)). For completeness, the index requirements for Australian state and territory government annual reports were also included.

## Structure of a typical Commonwealth annual report

Commonwealth annual reports generally follow a templated structure. The following is typical:

•

letter of transmittal (to the responsible minister in Federal Parliament)

•

review by CEO/department secretary

•

overview of the department or agency, including role and functions, organizational structure and outcomes and programme structure

•

report on performance, including financial performance

•

management and accountability, including corporate governance, external security, human resources and staff statistics, performance pay and assets management

•

financial statements and notes, including independent auditor’s report

In Australia the reporting period is a financial year from 1 July to 30 June.

## Background to the research

Indexing of annual reports in Australia occurs between mid-August and early October. The turnaround time for indexes is very tight – three to four days is the usual maximum, even for a 300-page report. As the printed annual report must be tabled in the Federal Parliament by the end of October (a legislative requirement), indexers are under enormous pressure to return their indexes by the required deadline. Unfortunately, such ridiculously tight deadlines increase the risk of errors.

Contracts for indexing Commonwealth annual reports are offered either through the department/agency concerned or through external packagers (private organizations that manage the whole production process, including graphic design, editing and indexing). Both departments/agencies and packagers will most likely request quotes from the indexer who indexed the previous year’s annual report, providing, of course, that the quality of the index met their expectations. They will also request quotes from a minimum of two other indexers to meet competitive tendering requirements.

As indexers, being asked to quote on an index for an annual report prompts a look at the features of the previous year’s index, including length, style, quality and layout. This applies whether one indexed the previous annual report, or the index was compiled by someone else. Unless the content of the new annual report has changed extensively from the previous one, the former index can often be used as a template, because annual reports essentially include the same broad content from one year to the next. In general, if at least 60 per cent of the actual entries from the previous annual report are reusable (excluding page numbers), then the time savings will make it worthwhile to use the previous index. If not, starting from scratch is more effective.

One of the dilemmas for indexers is that they may be asked to create an index similar in style to the one printed in the previous annual report. This is reasonable if the previous index is satisfactory. However, if the index is inadequate, with, for example, poor heading/subheading structure, major sections not indexed or excessive cross-references, then tact will be required to explain why one’s proposed index will differ. If the previous annual report did not include an index, then the indexer will ask the department/agency or packager if they have any indexing guidelines. If they do not, best indexing practice should be followed.

The finished index will be typeset by a designer/typesetter within the department/agency or an external designer/typesetter nominated by the department/agency, or be handled by the packager in-house. In some instances, the department/agency may specify a house style for the annual report, but these specifications do not usually cover the index. This leaves the designer free to apply their own style to the layout of the index, which, although aesthetically pleasing, may not be appropriate for the index. Unfortunately, due to the extremely quick turnaround needed for the annual report, there is insufficient time in the production schedule for the indexer to review the typeset index.

The authors of this paper only index around 5 per cent of the Commonwealth annual reports produced in any given financial year, so this means that the remaining 95 per cent are unseen. This prompted us to consider three major questions:

1.

What is the overall quality of all Commonwealth annual report indexes produced?

2.

How do they meet the annual-report aids-to-access criteria, particularly the alphabetical index and list of requirements?

3.

Are the indexes useful for their intended audiences?

Investigating these questions became more important when we were unable to find any comparable studies, despite our best endeavours.

## The research

Based on this background, the indexes of all 175 Australian Commonwealth annual reports produced for the 2016–17 financial year were investigated. While the annual reports were often available online in different formats, the PDF versions were used in all cases, as some online formats did not always include an index. For example, HTML versions were often unpaginated, only available as sections rather than as a complete report and, significantly, were not indexed. Other online versions were produced as Word documents, but even if they had an index, the index quite often did not match the text, as the index had been created for the PDF version and inserted into the Word version without correcting for pagination changes. For example, some Word versions had the images removed to reduce the file size.

Section 17AJ of the Rule was used as the authority mandating the inclusion of an alphabetical index and a list of requirements. The problem with the Rule and the later Resource Management Guide No. 135, _Annual report for non-corporate Commonwealth entities_ (RMG 135) (Department of Finance, [2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.17#core-R1)) is that they only specify the inclusion of an alphabetical index, but provide no specifications about the length, layout, style, content or quality of the index. These factors, however, can all impact on the usability of the alphabetical index and the overall annual report. To overcome this deficiency the authors devised and considered seven criteria for assessing the indexes.

### Criteria for assessing indexes

1.

whether alphabetical index is present

2.

general information and length/number of columns of the index

5.

indexing of mandatory content, e.g. financial information and information about staff

6.

indexing of general content and subject analysis overall

### Methods

•

In late 2017, the Australian government’s list of departments or agencies identified 175 non-corporate organizations. The 2016–17 annual reports of each of these organizations were analysed for this survey.

•

The assessment criteria listed above were used as a guide to what we wanted to find out.

•

Answers to questions with multiple possible options were predefined to assist future analysis (e.g. the number of columns in the index). This approach helped standardize the responses and reduced the amount of time spent on each annual report.

•

To ensure consistency of assessment between the authors, the index to one annual report was assessed independently by both authors and the results compared. Any variations in approach were then rationalized. Regular communication between the authors was maintained as the survey progressed to discuss any issues or unusual features that arose.

•

To share the assessment load, one author started with A and worked down, while the other started with Z and worked up.

•

Each annual-report assessment was completed in 45 minutes on average.

## Results

Two-thirds of the Commonwealth annual-report indexes were deemed satisfactory and thus met both the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Rule [2014](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.17#core-R3) aids-to-access requirements, and the resulting usability criterion derived by the authors of this paper. However, some organizations appeared to be confused over the difference between an alphabetical index and the list of requirements.

For index layouts a variety of styles were identified; there was no standard style. Some styles were fine, but others, although aesthetically pleasing, were harder for the reader to use. Indexing quality was also extremely variable, ranging from exemplary to seriously deficient to virtually unusable.

The extensive survey results have been broken down into smaller sections for ease of understanding. The order of the results largely follows the assessment criteria listed above, but some topics did not conveniently fit into a single category.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.17#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup>

### What do these annual reports look like?

Of the 175 annual reports examined, the majority were between 50 and 200 pages in length, while seven reports were between 300 and 400 pages and seven fewer than 50 pages. Of these 175 reports, 137 had an alphabetical index. This meant that 38 annual reports – or around one in five – did not have an alphabetical index. This is a large proportion, given that including an index is a mandatory requirement. The breakdown of the types of organizations with or without alphabetical indexes is provided in [Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.17#F1).

### Reports with no alphabetical index

After determining which reports had an alphabetical index, the 38 reports without an alphabetical index were explored in more detail. In terms of length, the number of pages in these annual reports was similar to their indexed counterparts, so the absence of an index could not be excused on the basis that these were small reports. To be fair, 25 of these reports included a list of requirements. Perhaps some organizations were confused by the function of the list and did not realize that the list of requirements differs from the alphabetical index. Organizations from most sectors were identified in this group, but those from the primary industries, Indigenous and communications sectors were highly represented ([Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.17#F1)).

### Index layouts

So that readers can appreciate some of the variety of index layouts seen in government annual reports, four examples are provided.

The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency index ([Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.17#F2)) right-justified the page numbers, did not indent turnover lines and had an unusual cross-reference style. Each heading was also separated by a dotted underline. Although this index is usable, it could be improved by indenting turnover lines and using a better cross-reference style.

The index to the Future Fund annual report ([Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.17#F3)) does not use any subheadings, resulting in long strings of undifferentiated page numbers. Using italics for all page numbers is unusual, and most likely a typesetting decision. The unusual aspect of this index is how the entries for each letter are set out in double columns. This approach is unlikely to save space compared with standard double columns. Also, the long strings of undifferentiated page numbers under some headings actively discourage readers from looking up information.

The index to the Meat and Livestock Australia annual report ([Figure 4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.17#F4)) groups the section headings used in the report under three broad headings. This classified style is not helpful as the reader must guess which section will cover the topic they are looking for. A conventional index treatment providing more alphabetical detail would help enormously.

The Australian Communications and Media Authority index ([Figure 5](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.17#F5)) is an exemplar of good indexing practice, with its clear, logical, well-laid-out and easily navigable structure. The placement of the large number of entries beginning with numerals before those beginning with A is consistent with good indexing principles.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.17#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup>

### How are the indexes set out?

For the 137 annual reports that featured an index, space for the index was not an issue, as the number of pages devoted to the index ranged between one and 15, with two outliers taking 22 and 25 pages. Three-quarters (102) of the reports set out the index using two columns. Single-column layout was the next most common, with a handful of reports using three or four columns.

The indexes were typically divided using alphabet separators. Page numbers were placed after headings, with about 10 per cent setting them as right-justified. Three-quarters of the indexes had a comma before the page number. Of the remainder, just one used an en dash, while the others had no punctuation. Impressively, in one annual report index, the page numbers were hyperlinked to the appropriate section in the text.

Just over half of the indexes set page ranges out in full (e.g. 50–9), with one-third using a compressed style (e.g. 50–9). Either style is acceptable. The remainder either did not have any page ranges in the index or were inconsistent in the style used.

Due to the nature of the content of annual reports, it was unsurprising that no formatting or abbreviations were used to indicate photographs or tables. However, in a couple of cases, all page numbers were in bold or italics (e.g. see [Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.17#F3)). This approach, although not wrong, is potentially confusing, as bold or italics tend to be used to denote illustrations. Bold can also be used for major discussions.

The use of italics in main headings, for the titles of Acts of Parliament, for example, was mostly applied appropriately. In cases where the italics were missing, it is impossible to know if the character style was present and lost during typesetting, or not used in the first place.

### Indents and turnover lines

When an index entry spreads over two lines, the second line should be indented. About a quarter of the indexes had problems with turnover lines. In many cases there was no indent. Some indexes used the same amount of indent as used for subheadings, while others had excessive indents or were not consistent in the size of the indent. Indents used for subheadings were fine, with only a few exceptions.

Whether the indent and turnover-line problems were caused by the indexers, we don’t know, because even if the indexer creates them correctly, they may be lost in layout. Unfortunately, indents and turnover lines are subject to the layout decisions of the designer.

Below are examples of both poor and good uses of turnover lines.

> 
> Workforce Capability Framework 30–31, 42, 45

### Single or double line spacing

One would have thought that typesetting an index would be a straightforward decision of using either single or double spacing between lines. Around halfway through the analysis it became apparent that another option, not quite double spacing, had been used. This was 1.5 spacing. In hindsight all the earlier double-spacing results should have been checked again, as some were likely to have been 1.5 spacing and not double. This was not done. The results showed that 60 per cent used single spacing, with a best estimate of around 20 per cent using double spacing, and the remaining 20 per cent using 1.5 line spacing. Aesthetically the 1.5 line spacing was visually pleasing and assisted readability, compared to single spacing, which was tight and hard to read, or double spacing, which was wasteful of page space. Also surprising was the number of indexes that added lines (rules) under each heading (e.g. see [Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.17#F2)), or individual letters grouped in double columns (e.g. see [Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.17#F3)).

### Abbreviations

Abbreviations are widely used within annual reports and there is usually a glossary or list of abbreviations provided to assist readers. In this research, the use of abbreviations was found to be particularly common (only 15 per cent of indexes did not use any). Abbreviations of the organization name were ubiquitous, although some indexes had used multiple variations, probably due to inconsistencies in the annual report.

The most popular style (55 per cent of indexes) was to place the abbreviation after the main heading. The second most common style (37 per cent) was to use abbreviations as main headings. Using abbreviations in subheadings was equally common (36 per cent). With the inclusion of a glossary in most reports, the use of _see_ references linking abbreviations with the full name was not common. When used, it was far more common to go from the abbreviation to the full name.

### Numbers in headings

The majority of indexes (79 per cent) did not use numbers as headings in the index. For the 29 indexes that did, 14 listed them before the letter A (e.g. see [Figure 5](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.17#F5)), 13 filed them as if the number was spelt out, and two ignored the number in filing and filed by first main word. A common heading with numbers started with a year: for example, ‘2015/16 annual report’. Most of these headings starting with a year were filed under T, as if spelt out, but this is not the most logical place for the reader to find the information. Treating as ‘annual report 2015/16’ would have been preferable.

### Mandatory content

Mandatory content refers to how topics expected to be covered in all annual reports were indexed. This included financial information, details about staff, references to legislation, personal names and remuneration of senior staff. Several of the checks made related to material located in appendices. For example, was there an entry in the index for the glossary or list of abbreviations? In 80 per cent of cases where a glossary or list of abbreviations was included in the report, nearly half of all indexes did not contain entries for this material.

### Entries under the organization name

Should there be an entry in the index for the name of the organization? Since the entire report relates to the organization’s activities for the past year, inclusion of such a heading requires thinking carefully about what entries go under that heading. Some indexers would argue that it is appropriate to have subheadings relating to key organizational features, such as the board of management, the role and function of the organization, and a performance statement. Interestingly, half of all indexes included an entry for the organization name, while the other half did not. It must be assumed that this difference in indexing approach reflects individual indexers’ views on handling the metatopic, in this case the organization name.

A second question looked at whether organizational features were indexed under the organization name or separately. Of the indexes including the organization name, the highest proportion (45 per cent) contained separate entries, while 35 per cent indexed key features under the organization name. When indexed under the organization name, double posting was used appropriately in around two-thirds of cases.

### Financial information

Typically, one-third to one-half of an annual report contains financial information and related notes. Yet in 77 per cent of indexes only a single entry for financial information was found. Most indexers did not distinguish between financial statements and the pages referring to the notes. While we do not expect this section to be indexed with the same level of detail as the rest of the report, key tables, such as the cash-flow statement, should be indexed. Similarly, the notes to the financial statements contain other useful information that should be indexed, such as remuneration received by senior staff or details of staff on various employment agreements. Just 18 per cent of indexes contained entries referring to remuneration in the financial notes.

Frequently the financial statements are not available to the indexer, as they are still being worked on. They are usually represented in the indexer’s copy by the requisite number of blank pages. However, even if this is the case, the small number of key index entries for the financial statements and notes, such as statement of financial position, should be included, with the page number marked, for example as XXXX. These page numbers can be added in later on, once they are known, by the department/agency editor, packager or typesetter.

The organization’s financial information is audited by the Australian National Audit Office, which issues an independent auditor’s report that is included at the beginning of the annual report’s financial statements. While entries for the independent auditor’s report were included in just over half of the indexes, the variety of headings employed was surprising:

> ANAO
> 
> audit report
> 
> Auditor-General’s report
> 
> auditor’s report
> 
> auditor’s report, independent
> 
> Australian National Audit Office (ANAO)
> 
> independent auditor’s report

### Annual performance review

Another key aspect of an annual report is the annual performance review. This usually involves a statement about the organization’s annual performance, followed by details of the various components and items used to measure that performance. In some reports these may be called outcomes or programmes and are often grouped and given multi-level numbers. Where an annual performance statement was included and the section was indexed, one-third of indexes contained an entry under A for ‘annual’ and around a quarter had an entry under P for ‘performance’. Double posting under A and P was used in 18 per cent of indexes.

Considerable variation was seen in the way components and items used to measure performance were indexed. Nearly 60 per cent were given subject headings, about 30 per cent were indexed under the number given to the outcome, and around 20 per cent were indexed under the name given to the outcome measure. As some indexes included multiple approaches, results exceed 100 per cent. Only 3 per cent of indexes listed items as subheadings under ‘performance’. The performance review content was not indexed in 17 per cent of indexes.

### Indexing of legislation and regulations

Government organizations are subject to legislation and regulations, which are frequently cited within annual reports. While it is usual for legislation and regulations to be indexed, 16 per cent of indexes made no mention of them. In addition, there were instances where the legislation and regulations were not always indexed well (e.g. indexed at times and ignored in others), and in 15 per cent of cases legislation that should have been indexed was missed.

### Government departments and agencies

Government organizations do not work in isolation and often have strong links to other government bodies. In a quarter of the indexes, there was no mention of these additional organizations, despite significant references to them in the text.

### Personal names

People are usually featured within annual reports. There are often biographies (up to half a page in length) of the chief executive officer and board members, as well as details of staff who won awards and the minister the organization reports to. Nearly 40 per cent of the indexes did not include personal names. This high percentage could be due to organizations specifically requesting that names not be indexed. Interestingly, most of the sectors listed in [Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.17#F1) included organizations that did not index personal names, but this was particularly prevalent in those from health, infrastructure and primary industries.

### Staff

How many terms can be used to refer to staff? Organizations can refer to them as ‘employees’, ‘staff’, ‘workforce’ or ‘human resources’, with the associated management aspects being ‘human resources management’ or ‘people management’. The variety of headings used in the indexes reflected all these terms, with ‘staff’ being the most common. Many indexes provided cross-references to ‘staff’ from the alternative terms. In some instances, two headings were in use (e.g. ‘staff’ and ‘human resources’), with no clear reason for differentiation, or any links between the terms. Alternatively, the organization’s preference for ‘workforce’ was used, with no guidance for readers from ‘staff’ or other terms.

A subsequent question looked at how staff-related topics, such as remuneration, training and workplace agreements, were indexed. In 55 per cent of indexes, these items were indexed under an appropriate main heading. In 47 per cent, they were indexed as subheadings under ‘staff’ or ‘human resources’. In 10 per cent of cases, the relevant page numbers were listed after the heading used for staff. Inconsistency was noted in 17 per cent of indexes, while these topics were not indexed at all in 12 per cent of indexes.

### Filing

With topics like staff filed under W for ‘workforce’ and other material filed in unusual places (e.g. ‘about agency’ filed under ‘about’), this section on the indexing of mandatory content concluded with a subjective question asking whether topics were filed where one would expect them to be. In 59 per cent of indexes, we felt they were, which left a large remainder where the terms were hard to find due to a lack of cross-references to the target term.

### General content

General content refers to the indexing of the subjects covered by the organization: for example, indexing of education material in an annual report relating to education. After assessing the subject analysis of each index, the overall subject indexing was rated and specific faults examined. In 72 per cent of indexes, the subject analysis was acceptable or well done. In one index, the material was considered to be over-indexed (i.e. excessive entries for the degree of content), while the remainder had poor or inadequate subject analysis.

Specific faults were widespread and varied, with some indexes having multiple faults. Poor subject analysis was identified in 41 per cent of indexes, a lack of double posting in 23 per cent, unindexed sections in 21 per cent, items not filed where expected in 20 per cent, and headings with long strings of page numbers in 18 per cent. Finally, a classified style of indexing was seen in 12 per cent of indexes.

### Quality of the indexing

In this section the accuracy of indexing was examined. First, was the index created by putting the table of contents in alphabetical order? Indexing using this approach is classed as negligent and deemed unsatisfactory due to its lack of specificity. Our results indicate that 10 per cent of indexes were compiled this way. The remainder were normal.

Page number accuracy is important in indexing and in just over 70 per cent of indexes the locators were determined to be accurate. A few minor errors were found in 21 per cent of indexes, with an extensive range of serious errors in a further 4 per cent of cases. Notably, 5 per cent of indexes did not use page ranges when required.

### Cross-references

The prevalence and use of _see_ and _see also_ cross-references were examined. _See_ references were used in 73 per cent of indexes and _see also_ references in 65 per cent. Most cross-references were used correctly, though a variety of styles was observed, especially regarding punctuation, plain text, bold and italicization. The following two examples show the variation found.

> _Examples of_ see _reference styles_
> 
> employees _see_ staff
> 
> employees (_see_ staff)
> 
> employees, _see_ staff
> 
> employees _see staff_
> 
> employees see staff
> 
> employees; _see_ staff
> 
> employees. _see_ staff

In addition to the above, some indexers had used _See_ in place of _see_.

> _Examples of_ see also _reference styles_
> 
> human resources _see also_ staff
> 
> human resources _see also_ staff
> 
> human resources _**see also**_ staff
> 
> human resources see also staff
> 
> human resources, _see also_ staff
> 
> human resources; _see also_ staff
> 
> human resources. _see also_ staff
> 
> human resources
> 
> training 35 (_see also_ staff training)

In addition to the above, some indexers had used _See also_ in place of _see also_.

While not suggesting that any of these styles for _see_ and _see also_ are necessarily wrong, standardization of styles across government organizations would be advantageous for designers/typesetters, as they could template that part of the index layout, as they do for many other elements of annual reports, without having to create a different style for each agency/department.

The location of _see also_ references showed five different indexing approaches across the 135 annual reports (styles A–E). Examples are provided below.

> _Location of_ see also _references_
> 
> Style A – run on from subheading
> 
> staff 34, 56–60, 66
> 
> diversity 59, 60
> 
> learning 58, 61–62
> 
> remuneration 60, _see also_ remuneration
> 
> statistics 104–106
> 
> Style B – as last subheading
> 
> telemarketing 38, 79
> 
> complaints 80
> 
> consumer and industry alerts 82
> 
> _see also_ Do Not Call Register
> 
> Style C – as first subheading
> 
> Judges 2–5, 112–13
> 
> _see also_ Chief Justice
> 
> appointments and retirements 6–7
> 
> committees 58, 66–68
> 
> Style D – after main heading without page numbers
> 
> Traditional Owners _see also_ Indigenous populations
> 
> consultations with 86
> 
> field management activities 72
> 
> partnerships with 9, 10, 42–46, 48–50
> 
> Style E – after main heading page numbers
> 
> Senior Executive Service employees 55–57, see also key management personnel
> 
> biographical details 57–60
> 
> learning and development 65
> 
> remuneration 61, 62, 103

Styles B and C were the most common, but none of the approaches for the placement of _see also_ cross-references are wrong. However, standardization of styles across government organizations would be desirable.

### Subheadings

Subheadings were used in 85 per cent of the indexes. In 60 per cent of these, subheadings were used appropriately, while in just 4 per cent they were not (e.g. unusual heading/subheading combinations). The remaining indexes exhibited a range of issues with subheadings, including notable absences, misfiling and incorrect indentation.

### Failing indexes

Assessing the indexes of the 137 annual reports overall, 26 of them (18 per cent) were regarded as failing, with all of these suffering from a string of serious faults, not just a single error. Trying to use one of these indexes resulted in a total inability to find the information that one was looking for. The following cases provide an indication of the types of serious problems found in this group.

•

Case 1: a 90-page report had an index of just 11 entries.

•

Case 2: a 140-page report had an index of 12 entries, with the last entry starting at N.

•

Case 3: a 120-page report had used the table of contents and put it into alphabetical order under three sections: organization name, financials and operations.

•

Case 4: the index to a 180-page report had several faults, but the major issue was that it did not include any page ranges. Where page ranges should have been used (e.g. 112–61 for the financial statements), only the first page number (112) was given. This same error occurred repeatedly throughout the index.

Given the severity of failure in these 26 indexes, the annual reports for the previous financial year were examined to compare their index quality. Twenty of the 2015–16 reports had indexes that were equally bad. In four cases the indexes to the 2015–16 reports were better, meaning that the indexing quality had deteriorated in the subsequent year. It was impossible to find two of the 2015–16 reports due to organizational restructurings and mergers.

### Who did the indexing?

With few exceptions, details of who compiled the indexes were not included in the annual reports. Whether the poorer indexes were compiled by people who are not professional indexers is unknown, but we can only assume this to be the case. Encouraging departments/agencies whose annual reports contained poor indexes to seek the skills of a professional indexer for their future indexing needs would be desirable, as would recommending targeted training for those whose indexing skills are less than adequate.

## Conclusions

Twenty-one per cent of reports (38 out of 175) did not meet the aids-to-access guidelines of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Rule [2014](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.17#core-R3) (and later RMG 135) because they had no indexes. In addition, 15 per cent of all reports (26 out of 175) or 19 per cent of reports with indexes (26 out of 137) had failing indexes – indexes which were not of acceptable quality according to the criteria used by the authors of this paper. Combining the number of failing indexes (26) with the number of reports without an index (38) meant that 64 of the 175 Commonwealth annual reports for 2016–17 (37 per cent) were deemed unsatisfactory. Given this result, it is discouraging that more than one-third of the annual reports presented to Parliament failed our usability test, and, more importantly, did not meet the needs of their intended audience.

Furthermore, it is possible there is confusion in some government departments and agencies between an alphabetical index and a list of requirements. Providing clarification about their specific differences and functions is essential, as is pointing out that both are legislatively mandated for inclusion in annual reports.

For government departments and agencies that produce their annual report in more than one format, e.g. PDF and Word, it is essential that each format has a separate alphabetical index, as the pagination between the two formats is likely to differ.

With the wide variety of layout styles used for indexes, it would be advantageous for departments/agencies to include details about the layout of indexes in their specifications to graphic designers and typesetters. This same advice should include the use and placement of _see_ and _see also_ cross-references. If a whole-of-government style could be developed for index layout, all the better. This is possibly something for the committee for the upcoming seventh edition of the _Style manual for authors, editors and printers_ to consider.

For Australian state and territory governments that mandate alphabetical indexes in their annual reports, the implications of the results presented here are equally applicable, particularly in the areas of layout, style and mandatory content.

Contracting competent professional annual-report indexers to index government annual reports is essential. Since the pool of skilled indexers available in Australia to do the work is small, there is a clear need for specific annual-report indexing training to boost numbers and overall competency.

### Checklist

For Commonwealth government departments and agencies wanting to check the usability of the alphabetical index in their annual reports, the following checklist is provided. Satisfying these criteria is essential for meeting the spirit of the requirements of the current RMG 135, since the requirements are met simply by an index (however poor) being present. The checklist is equally applicable to Australian state and territory government departments and agencies.

•

The index is alphabetical.

•

The layout is clear, so that subheadings are indented and clearly distinguishable from turnover lines.

•

Names of legislation are italicized.

•

There are entries under the name of the organization.

•

There are entries under the CEO and board members’ names.

•

Mandatory content, including annual reporting statement, corporate governance, corporate structure, committees, members, functions and responsibilities, and legislative framework, are indexed.

•

Financial statements, including the independent auditor’s report, are indexed appropriately.

•

Subject analysis of general content is appropriate – not too detailed, but not too superficial either.

•

Topics are indexed where one would expect to find them, particularly those relating to staff.

•

No major topics are missing from the index.

•

No long strings of undifferentiated page numbers are present, i.e. if there are more than eight to ten page numbers for a heading, include subheadings.

•

Cross-references, i.e. _see_ and _see also_, are used appropriately.

•

Appendices have been indexed appropriately.

•

Entries exist for the glossary and/or list of abbreviations.
