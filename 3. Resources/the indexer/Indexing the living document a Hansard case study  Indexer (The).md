## Abstract

The team responsible for the Hansard index at the Legislative Assembly of Ontario describe their process for indexing legislative debates. They discuss the challenges of handling changing terminology, evolving topics, and partisan discussions, as well as the nitty-gritty details of handling cross-references and repetitious content. The team also share their methods of maintaining consistency among multiple indexers and reveal the indexing questions they are currently grappling with. This case study may be of interest to other groups of indexers working with large amounts of dynamic content.

## Introduction

It is that time again – the parliamentary session has ended and it is time to edit and finalize the Hansard index for print publication.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.14#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> If it has been a long session, headings may number in the thousands and the number of entries in the tens of thousands. As such, this will not be the first edit, but it will be the last opportunity to correct errors and inconsistencies, and to clean up the structure of an index that has often grown chaotic over the last six to eighteen months. So, where do we begin?

## Ongoing and end-of-session editing

Hansard is a living document; new content is added every time the House sits and a new collection of entries is added to the index. For that reason, the index is also a living document that grows and evolves as the topics of debate develop over time. The indexing team consists of three indexers and an indexing assistant, and entries are published online within the week, sometimes on the very day they are indexed. It is therefore imperative that each indexer remains aware not only of their own history in indexing a topic, but of the other Hansard indexers’ work as well.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.14#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> For this reason, editing happens in two stages: (1) while new content is being actively indexed, and (2) in a final review of the whole index at the end of the session. In this article, we will take a closer look at both of these strategies.

As the index develops, entries are concurrently edited. This is essentially a partial-index edit, as we work with smaller chunks of the index at a time and may not be able to identify all of the connections or areas of major conceptual overlap at this point. This editing often involves spot-checking headings for inconsistencies in terminology, spelling, and the manner in which they are broken down, as well as looking for headings that already appear a little unruly and are in need of restructuring. While minor editing can happen at any time, more substantial changes at this stage tend to occur during House recesses where the public-facing index (which includes the most recent representation of all of our active indexes) is examined to ensure consistency of heading content and structure in order to head off major restructuring at the end of the session.

Once the session ends, this process is repeated, but with a more complete view of how the index has evolved. We look at the overall structure of the index, identify the major conceptual areas and overlapping elements, and decide upon the appropriate depth of indexing within each topic area. As this is the final chance to review the end product, it needs to be done either as a group, with significant discussions and decisions being made at the time, or individually – each person reviewing the index and incorporating their edits until there is a final agreed version.

During both of these types of editing there are numerous challenges to face in developing an index that is complete, consistent, and user-friendly, including dealing with changing terminology and topic evolution, identifying overlapping topics for cross-referencing and neutral terminology for highly partisan discussions, and managing repeated mentions of a concept and the appropriate depth of indexing – all with multiple indexers!

## Challenges

### Changing terminology and topic evolution

There are two main factors that contribute to the difficulty of maintaining heading clarity and consistency: (1) how terminology is used and changes over the course of a session, and (2) topics of debate that change markedly over time or are temporally sensitive.

With regard to terminology that changes, this refers to terms whose definitions or use by speakers evolve over the course of the session. A good example of this is ‘affordable housing’. This is a term that perhaps has (or had at one time) a specific definition, but has become a catch-all for a broad spectrum of concepts related to the affordability of housing. Within the same session, the term ‘affordable housing’ has been used to mean housing that is affordable in nature; social, subsidized, or community housing; rent or mortgage prices that are at-market; rent or mortgage prices that represent 30 per cent of a renter or buyer’s income; cooperative housing; and alternative housing arrangements. Often, all of these terms are used interchangeably; at other times, they are used specifically and are clearly differentiated, which can make it very difficult to determine the appropriate indexing term. Initially, it was difficult to determine an appropriate strategy for addressing this challenge. How would these varying definitions of ‘affordable housing’ be differentiated? Should the indexing team create their own differentiated headings, even though these may not reflect exactly what is in the text? How should general policy discussions that approach ‘affordable housing’ in a broad sense be dealt with? Do we cross-post under all possible headings or post under a general term and cross-reference from each of the alternatives?

To address this question, the team re-evaluated the terms at their disposal. While in a previous session ‘affordable housing’ had been used exclusively to denote social housing because the term was used in legislation relating to social housing, the decision was made to adapt its use in the current index, given the change in the nature of the discussions, to denote the more general concept of housing affordability and its various definitions. This allowed specific terms for housing models (e.g. government-subsidized, cooperative, rental, etc.) to be incorporated under their own terms to capture model-specific discussions about affordability. Some consideration was given to returning to the use of ‘social housing’, but this was deemed to be too outdated. Fortunately, while the fluid nature of Hansard documents can be a burden, it can also be a blessing as sometimes answers will reveal themselves over time. A new term for social housing began to appear, albeit relatively seldom: that of ‘community housing’. Research into this term soon demonstrated its frequent use in municipal literature and it soon became the preferred term for government-subsidized housing. A handful of related terms help to classify other concepts that are related to affordable-housing discussions, including a general ‘Housing’ heading, ‘Housing supply’, and ‘Rental housing’, among others. Creating boundaries between the various housing-related index headings was important, even if they differ from the ambiguous use of ‘affordable housing’ in the Hansard text itself.

A second, related issue is the evolution of topics. All topics evolve in terms of how deeply they are discussed, and thus indexed (which is covered below under ‘Depth of indexing’), but here we are referring to concepts whose very definitions have changed over the course of a session. These include changes to ministry names; prospective organizations, programmes, or policies prior to their formal existence versus their final outcome; and rumors or speculation that may or may not become reality.

Sometimes these concepts have a central term that can be used to discuss speculation as well as its previous, current, and future iterations with minimal difficulty. An example would be a proposed structural reform of a government agency or specific piece of legislation. Using the agency or statute name and some key terms to indicate change (e.g. review, reform) can help differentiate the past from the present. If, however, the reform modifies the name of the agency in question, this complicates matters, and instead both names should be used as headings along with the requisite cross-references.

Other examples are more challenging, such as a proposed agency that may or may not ever be formed. Take, for example, a newly proposed oversight agency that is being discussed, but is not yet named. As time passes and the framework evolves, this agency continues to remain nameless. Here there is no choice but to use a rather vague index heading that would normally be avoided: General policy area – new government agency. To complicate matters further, the entire framework may be abandoned for any number of reasons – not only leaving the proposed agency nameless, but also leaving the indexers trying to find a way to integrate this abandonment of proposed policy into the index.

Another example would be a policy reform that has (a) a set, pre-existing policy framework that is discussed; (b) a proposed framework which may end up evolving beyond its original scope; (c) an interim framework that is used to fill the gap between the old and the new; and (d) a ‘speculated’ framework that may have no connection to the interim or end product.

Here we consider a fictitious example using the processing of agricultural products as our policy area. Say there is a statute called the ‘Abbatoirs Act, 1942’ that was in effect and relatively unchanged from 1942 to 2003. In 2003, the government decided to completely update the Abbatoirs Act and create a new framework for the regulation of meat processing which they enact through the Meat Processing Act, 2003. However, following an election in 2004, the new government decides that they wish to implement their own framework for the regulation of meat-processing facilities and they immediately repeal the 2003 version, but it is going to take time for them to put their new plan into place and everyone agrees that they cannot just rely on the framework that was developed in 1942, so they need to create an interim framework. They talk extensively about not only their own planned framework, but also the previous one from 2003, and how they plan to regulate meat-processing facilities until their new legislation is ready and passed. Finally, the opposition is worried about what the new framework will look like and they tend to discuss both the interim and the new framework based upon their own assumptions about what the new government will do. So throughout this debate there are discussions on

•

the original Abbatoirs Act, 1942

•

the new Meat Processing Act, 2003

•

the forthcoming framework from the new government

•

the interim framework that will bridge the gap between the repeal of the Meat Processing Act, 2003 and the forthcoming legislation

•

what the forthcoming framework is going to look like that may or may not have any relation to this new legislation when it does finally appear.

Just to complicate things one step further, while completing their consultations on this forthcoming framework for abbatoirs, the new government decides to extend their review to the dairy-processing industry, and then a few weeks later, the industry of agricultural-products processing in general.

So what do we do with all of this? Discussion about the original legislation can often be easily placed under a heading for Abbatoirs Act, 1942, but everything else likely needs to be connected to the subject area, not the legislation. Here is an example of what could be done:

> Meat processing
> 
> Meat processing reform (2003)
> 
> Meat processing reform (2005)
> 
> Meat processing reform (interim)

The following heading could also be created to reflect the increase in scope of the consultation:

> Agricultural processing reform – consultation

Similarly, ambiguity can occur with regard to speculation about the future of a given government asset or program. The nature of political discussions means that a government may be questioned about the potential cancellation of a program or the privatization of an asset that are not actually set to occur. This discussion needs to be reflected in the index but in a way that does not misconstrue the reality of the situation.

As such, if speculation about the potential cancellation of a program can be traced back to changes to the program’s funding structure, for example, then rather than using the subheading ‘cancellation’ to qualify the discussion, a subheading such as ‘government funding’ captures both the essence of the question and the government’s response. If the speculation stems from a restructuring of the program, the aforementioned ‘reform’ qualifier can be used in the heading. Nevertheless, speculation about forthcoming policy that does not come to fruition remains a difficult concept to accurately capture in the indexes and often remains undifferentiated from substantiated policy after editing.

### Cross-reference management

Identifying appropriate cross-references can be very difficult with a team of three indexers who are only deeply familiar with subject matter that they themselves have indexed. Frequent communication is therefore required in order to identify potential connections between subject areas that an individual indexer might not be aware of or familiar with. Furthermore, the sheer number of cross-references that may be required within a long index with a complex structure can become cumbersome and difficult to keep track of. That said, cross-references are immensely useful in helping to avoid mass double- or even triple-posting and to help address some of the terminology-related issues discussed above. So, when are cross-references used? It is often easiest to add cross references while indexing, while the concepts and their relationships are fresh in our minds. They may even be added when they do not seem completely necessary, because it is easier to delete superfluous cross-references during a later editing session than it is to create them from scratch. Existing cross-references are also helpful when returning to index a topic that has not been discussed for a while, as they cue the indexer to the presence of a particular relational structure and prevent the creation of two parallel structures for the same topic. Of course, if reference points change over the course of a session, this may lead to circular or dead references, and so the reference-checking tools in the indexing software (Cindex) are certainly helpful in this area. Direct (see) references are often used to help manage unwieldy topics whose headings grow quickly, allowing them to be broken down into multiple separate headings while still indicating their relationship to one another. They are also key to ensuring that the index captures the various access points likely to be sought by the diverse audience that uses it.

### Partisan discussions

An inevitable element of parliamentary debates is discussions of a partisan nature. With regard to indexing such discussions, there exist two main challenges: (1) selecting neutral terms that can be used to discuss both sides of a political issue and (2) knowing when material has become unindexable because it is too partisan and no longer substantially policy-related. It is important that these challenges be addressed early on – they cannot wait until the final edit and therefore appropriate terminology is often discussed as these questions arise.

Being able to identify appropriate neutral terms for a given discussion is key to indexing Hansard. For example, indexing discussions regarding the amount of money being spent within a policy area requires the avoidance of terms that express bias, such as ‘cut’, ‘efficiency’, or ‘savings’. In such cases, simply using the term ‘funding’, without any kind of qualifier, is often appropriate. Similarly, a ‘shortage’ or ‘surplus’ of a particular resource, depending on the speaker’s point of view, can both be captured under the neutral heading ‘supply’. This is not to say that clear, fact-based changes cannot be indexed, but these should only occur when there is confidence in the information, and when the veracity of the increase/decrease or surplus/shortage itself is not being debated. For example, a 25 per cent decrease in a tax benefit for owners of horse-drawn carriages could be indicated as such if it was its sufficiency and impact on other areas (e.g. carriage-building companies, horse welfare, etc.) that were the contentious issues. One way of checking for possible bias in headings is by looking for divisions along party lines in speaker subheadings. For example, if both ‘funding decrease’ and ‘funding increase’ were used to differentiate discussions about hospital funding, it might become apparent that all or most of the locators under ‘funding decrease’ are associated with speakers of a particular party, while the locators under ‘funding increase’ are all associated with speakers from a different party. This indicates that perhaps this is a partisan issue that requires a more neutral term.

At times, discussions become so partisan that it is difficult to identify indexable material. These may include assignation of motives for a policy position (e.g. ‘they just don’t care’ or ‘they’re more interested in _A_ than _B_’); discussion about party philosophy or ideology (e.g. ‘The ABC party believes (or doesn’t believe) in …’); campaign-style enumeration of policy promises when an election is not active (e.g. ‘we’re going to (long list of campaign promises) …’ or ‘we would (long list of campaign promises) …’); or vague statements referencing another party’s position and the general goodness or badness of a policy (e.g. ‘I don’t know why they wouldn’t support this’ or ‘it is a good/bad policy’). In such cases it is important to feel comfortable choosing _not_ to index material when appropriate. It can be difficult to identify what is or is not substantive policy discussion when a debate unfolds in a relatively vague manner over a lengthy period of time, as it can feel wrong to have few to no index entries for a stretch of Hansard. It is therefore important to remember that the primary purpose of the index is to allow users to access discussions about specific policy information, not political discourse.

### Depth of indexing

To what depth must Hansard be indexed? The answer changes by topic and with the passage of time. The main issue here is that early on in the session it is impossible to know how often and in what depth a topic will be discussed. It is often easier to over-index initially and remove subheadings during a later editing phase than to re-index undifferentiated locators that were initially too broadly indexed. This, however, is not always an easy task, as the topic may evolve in a manner that cannot be anticipated so early on. While it may be tempting, it is best to avoid indexing specific statistics and figures, such as funding amounts or the number of spaces in a program or facility, as this would violate the indexing rule of pointing to the location of information rather than giving the information outright. Also, these numbers can change and may be up for debate, and so finding that neutral and fact-based term is often preferable. This said, the unique nature of Hansard sometimes requires indexing rules to be broken.

Here we look at another imagined example. Let us suppose that the government is responsible for setting the maximum price of mattresses. In 2003, the government decided that the maximum price of $1,000 for a mattress was too high and decided to drop it in three stages. Immediately, they would set the maximum price at $980 to be followed by a decrease to $940 a few months later, and a final decrease to $900 in 2004. After that, increases to the maximum price of mattresses would be based upon the rate of inflation. When the new government takes over in 2004, the $940 maximum price is already in place, and they are not interested in changing that, but they feel that the drop to $900 should come more slowly, to give retail outlets more time to adapt to the impact of this decrease. Thus they freeze the maximum price at $940 until 2007, at which point the remaining $40 will be removed in $10 increments every three months. In 2008, increases to the maximum price of mattresses would be based on the rate of inflation.

This scenario creates a number of discussion points, including (a) the decrease to $940 in mid- to late 2003, (b) a planned decrease to $900 in 2004 that was cancelled before it was implemented, (c) hypothetical decreases in the maximum price of mattresses (i.e. what it ‘should’ be before we start allowing it to go up again), and (d) future increases to the maximum price that will be indexed to inflation. Typically the indexing team try to keep specific figures out of the headings, but over time these scenarios start to become indistinguishable, even for the indexers. As such, the decision may be made to differentiate these different discussions as follows:

> Mattresses, maximum price
> 
> Mattresses, maximum price – indexed to inflation
> 
> Mattresses, maximum price – to $940
> 
> Mattresses, maximum price – to $900

Because of this evolution, inevitably another indexing rule is broken, that of ‘only treat something once’. Sometimes older content has to be reviewed and re-indexed, as there is not always enough information during the initial discussion of a topic to enable it to be properly broken down.

Yet another indexing rule that sometimes has to be violated when indexing Hansard is that of orphan subheadings. Their use is rare, but sometimes a main heading is so broad in meaning that clarity is needed to help the user identify whether the discussions it points to are related to what they are looking for. An example of this would be a short but substantive discussion in Hansard about the compensation of hospital administrators. For the sake of argument, imagine that no further discussions regarding hospitals occur over the course of the session. A main heading that simply says ‘Hospitals’ or even ‘Hospital administration’ feels too broad. If a user wants to know if Hansard includes any debate about the way in which the hospital is governed, a ‘Hospital administration’ heading may lead them to believe that the discussion includes mentions of anything from board appointments and staffing levels to administrative structure and oversight. To dispel this ambiguity, one could potentially create a very specific main heading, i.e. ‘Hospitals – administrative compensation’, but given column spacing restrictions and visual appeal, is this really any different from placing ‘administrative compensation’ beneath the ‘Hospitals’ heading as an orphan subheading?

### Repetitious content

Like all indexers, the Hansard team strive to ensure that the index points users to the right material in the most straightforward manner, which includes _not_ pointing them to redundant instances of information. Unfortunately, the nature of political debate means that key statistics, figures, and policy statements are repeated, often verbatim. In extreme cases, a heading such as ‘health care funding’ could have hundreds of locators, almost all of them pointing to the same information (with perhaps the exception of a few, which is why this is so important an issue). At what point should we stop indexing the same fact or statement? This question is further compounded by the fact that Hansard is not only indexed by subject but also by speaker. Does one limit index entries to the first instance of a statement? First mention by each speaker? First mention by a member of each party? What if the stock statement is in direct response to a question on the topic that contains new information, even though the answer itself contains no new information? Does one solely index the question and ignore the answer?

As yet there are no strict rules on how to deal with such situations and each case tends to be treated as it arises. There is certainly a tendency to over-index, as even a well-reasoned cut-off point may appear to the casual observer to be an arbitrary or even political decision on the indexer’s part. If, for instance, a member of the legislature were looking for their contribution to a debate and found themselves missing from the index for the reasons explored above, they may wonder why they were left out. It is not their concern if their remarks simply reiterate what has previously been said on a topic and they wish to have their contributions noted, especially if their constituents or other Hansard readers are interested in what a specific member has to say on a particular topic. Inconsistencies in application of cut-off points are another issue to be addressed during the editing phase but it becomes increasingly difficult to find dropped entries as a session, and the index, grows longer.

### Consistency among multiple indexers

One last challenge that is fairly unique to Hansard indexing is that the index is not created by a solo indexer but through the collaboration of a team of three.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.14#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup> Each indexer naturally approaches their work slightly differently: they may use different terminology, index at different depths, and even interpret concepts and their connections differently. All members of the team need to be mindful of why another indexer may have chosen a particular term or structure but also act as a fresh set of eyes to help each other in the indexing and editing processes.

To help prevent potential inconsistencies, topics tend to be divided by indexer, so that one indexer will follow a bill, for example, throughout all of its legislative stages from first reading through to royal assent. This is not possible in all aspects of legislative business, such as Question Period, during which any and all topics of discussion may arise. Dividing work by topic can also create its own challenges; when one indexer spends a lot of time in a particular subject area, given their depth of knowledge on how the topic has evolved and been debated, they may establish a frame of reference that is less clear to those unfamiliar with the topic. A fresh set of eyes during the editing phase can therefore identify where this leads to unclear, confusing, or inaccessible information for an outside user.

Communication is key to reducing inconsistencies. Looking at each others’ index files frequently, and borrowing headings from one another when another indexer has already tackled a particular topic in depth, allow the team to compare indexes and recognize inconsistencies as they arise. Informal, impromptu conversations are held throughout the week for resolving indexing questions, and more recently these conversations have been supplemented with scheduled weekly meetings in order to share new content and solicit advice on addressing particularly difficult topics. No measure is foolproof, but regular communication can certainly mitigate the amount of editing required at the end of a session.

## Moving forward

This paper has discussed the challenges posed by indexing a living document – similarly, the indexing and editing processes are always constantly evolving. Weekly team meetings and frequent reference to the indexes-in-progress help ensure that all the indexers are aware of and in agreement with new terminology, cross-references, etc. Moving forward, some of the questions under consideration include: (1) Do we need a rule for repeated mentions? (2) Is it necessary to expand our existing subject authority list into a more robust controlled vocabulary? (3) Are there other ways to maximize within-subject consistency? And (4) how do we make sure the outward-facing, public document is the best possible product when an index is still under construction? Given the increasing prevalence of online indexing, and the fact that some professionals work with newspapers, serials, and databases – all examples of content that has the potential to change and evolve over time and may involve collaboration – we believe that the case study reported here may be relevant to others in the field, and we will continue to implement new tools and techniques with each successive index.
