**Piranesi**. Susanna Clarke. London: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2020. 288 pp. ISBN 978 1 5266 2242 6 (hbk), £14.99.

_Background_

One of the most highly anticipated titles of the autumn 2020 publishing boom was _Piranesi_, the new novel by Susanna Clarke. The book comes 16 years after her debut bestselling novel _Jonathan Strange and Mr.Norrell_ ([2004](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.12#core-R2)), and 14 years after her last publication, the short-story collection _The ladies of Grace Adieu_ ([2006](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.12#core-R3)). _Piranesi_ was nearing the top of my to-read pile when I saw a tweet saying that it should appeal to anyone interested in the history of the book, paratext and indexes. That was enough of a prompt to start reading it.

Clarke’s previous publications have been set in a world of magic, and _Piranesi_ continues this theme. The title itself gives an initial clue to the contents. The real Giovanni Battista Piranesi was an eighteenth-century Italian artist, archaeologist and architect, known for his intricate engravings of Rome and of real and fictional buildings. The reader doesn’t need to know this to enjoy the novel, but even a quick look at Piranesi’s artwork, particularly his _Imaginary prisons_ (1761), affords a good insight into the weird world about to be entered. (An excellent resource on these is The Digital Piranesi ([n.d.](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.12#core-R4)) project at the University of South Carolina, which is a digitized archive of their complete set of his posthumous _Opere_ (Works), with its own online index.)

From the first pages of _Piranesi_ the novel, it is clear that we are in a different world. The paratext is worth attention before diving in. The front-cover dustjacket image shows a faun standing on a Roman column (both are found in the real Piranesi’s artwork); underneath this, the hardcover shows more Roman columns of varying sizes; the endpapers show images of sea creatures, snowflakes and bees; the two epigraphs are from C. S. Lewis’s _The magician’s nephew_ ([1955](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.12#core-R6)) and a ‘Laurence Arne-Sayles’, both on the role of magicians and their experiments. The clues are there from the start.

The main text introduces a series of diary or journal entries, dated in an unusual way:

> ENTRY FOR THE FIRST DAY OF THE FIFTH MONTH IN THE YEAR THE ALBATROSS CAME TO THE SOUTH-WESTERN HALLS \[p. 3\].

These are the journals of a character called Piranesi, who describes their life in an odd, dark and vast House of ‘Halls’ and ‘Vestibules’, with its own Clouds, Tides, Staircases and Statues – the initial capital letters are part of their writing style. I am using ‘their’ deliberately as it’s not clear at this stage who ‘Piranesi’ really is, and they don’t seem to know either. Piranesi is exploring this world and has ‘begun a Catalogue’ in which to record all the statues and other points of interest in the hundreds of halls they have discovered to date.

Piranesi believes only 15 other people have ever lived in this world, deduced from the skeletal remains discovered on their travels. There seems to be only one other living person in the House, whom Piranesi terms ‘the Other’. The Other comes up with the Piranesi moniker in return, but Piranesi thinks this is strange because ‘as far as I remember it is not my name’. Piranesi describes them both as scientists, with the Other speaking of a ‘Great and Secret Knowledge’ hidden in the World that they are trying to find. They meet twice-weekly, at a prearranged place and for limited time, and Piranesi does all the exploration in the meanwhile.

Piranesi initially addresses these entries to the ‘Sixteenth Person’, who is whoever might be reading these journals at a later date, and describes their notebooks of observations. We are told that journal numbers 1 and 2 are labelled with the year 2012, but from journal 3 that year is crossed out and the other dating style is employed (‘Thirtieth Day in the Twelfth Month in the Year of Weeping and Wailing’). Piranesi doesn’t know why two date systems are used, nor why many pages of the early journals appear to have been ‘violently removed’.

_The role of the index_

This is all setting up for the role of the index, which is mentioned early in the book:

> One of the drawbacks of keeping a journal is the difficulty of finding important entries again and so it is my practice to use one notebook as an index to all the others \[p. 14\].

In the index notebook, Piranesi has allocated a number of pages for each letter of the alphabet (more for common letters, fewer for those such as Q and X). In these pages are recorded ‘entries by subject’ and ‘where in my Journals they are to be found’. Piranesi has completed nine journals and is currently working on number 10.

Nothing more is then mentioned about this index for half the book, but much else of interest is happening besides. Piranesi begins to glean that the Other is withholding details and has access to extra resources, including ‘his shining device’. The Other warns Piranesi that there is another new person in the labyrinth and to keep away from them. Piranesi refers to this new person as ‘16’, as it is the Sixteenth Person they have evidence of existing. Piranesi hears others’ footsteps and voices, and then meets a man who doesn’t seem to be ‘16’, whom Piranesi terms ‘the Prophet’. The Prophet starts giving Piranesi further information about what is actually going on and the true names of some people involved, including the real name of the Other.

It is then time for Piranesi to update their notebook index, a weekly task. After writing a few subject entries, Piranesi starts to add an entry for one of the names the Prophet mentioned – ‘Ovenden, Stanley’ – but finds that there is already an entry for this name higher up the page, with a few details and the location by journal and page number of where to find more:

> Ovenden, Stanley, student of Laurence Arne-Sayles: Journal no. 21, page 154. See also The disappearance of Maurizio Giussani, Journal no. 21, pages 186–7 \[p. 103\].

Piranesi’s current journal is number 10, but the index locators refer to Journal 21, which shouldn’t exist. Further up the ‘O’ page are more handwritten index entries (half a page’s worth of these are listed for the reader), referring to more concepts and names, including authors from both the real world and this fictional one. These also refer to journal numbers that should not exist:

> Outsider philosophy: Journal no. 17, pages 19–32; see also J. W. Dunne (Serialism), Owen Barfield, Rudolf Steiner \[p. 104\].

Piranesi recognizes these entries as being in their own handwriting, just subtly different – ‘in a word, younger’. Examining the ten journals, Piranesi finds that the first three had originally been numbered as 21, 22 and 23, just the first numeral has been scratched out in each case. Piranesi decides to look in Journal no. 1, on the page reference given for Ovenden for Journal 21, and indeed finds biographical notes of him written there (which are given for the reader). The same is done for the Giussani entry, which starts to link the names already heard.

The more names and information Piranesi finds out, the more they can continue to look up in the existing notebook index and journals, and the full story develops from there. For one of the character names, the journal entries make it clear that Piranesi had previously written notes for a talk about him and pros and cons for expanding this into a book. These notes give more of the background on the magical side of the text and how people found a way into this Other World from our own.

_Other texts_

Other textual forms are embedded in the novel. These include: fragments of pages torn from a notebook, found scattered on floors and woven into birds’ nests, which Piranesi collects to piece together; a handwritten letter, replied to in kind by Piranesi; chalked words on the floor, which the Other tells Piranesi to erase and not read; and a message spelled out in pebbles, which advises Piranesi of their real name for the first time, two-thirds through the book. Piranesi is also able to look up this name and relevant information in the notebook index and journals, which shows that at one time Piranesi was an academic writer elsewhere.

For more on the Other character, Piranesi has to consult the journal index both under the letter ‘O’ for ‘Other’ (as the later journals refer to him by that name) and also under the Other’s real name that is discovered. Piranesi has not known to cross-reference these entries before and needs the information from both. One of these entries remains intact in the journals, but most are in the ripped-out pages. These missing pages are the paper fragments that Piranesi has been collecting, and they form a whole chapter late in the novel, dated the year 2012, in which much of the rest of the story is revealed. What Piranesi then decides to do with all this (re)discovered knowledge forms the climax and ending of the book.

I am trying not to reveal all the spoilers here but, through the information discovered via the notebook index, by the end of the novel, Piranesi and the reader know the story involving some 15-plus names, and who is really whom in terms of Piranesi, the Other, the Prophet, 16, and probably some of the deceased, and how this all fits together.

The use of the index as plot device and map seems quite convincing to me as a professional indexer. I like how the handwritten notebook index means that Piranesi can tell that this was their own work by recognizing the handwriting. In the index examples displayed, the entries appear in journal-number order, because this is how Piranesi would have entered them as more information was found. There is also a pleasing moment when Piranesi has to look up a compound three-part name in the index, and finds nothing there under the last part of the name, but knows then to try under the second part of the name instead and duly finds the information sought.

_Literary links_

One of the main literary allusions in _Piranesi_ is, as indicated in the epigraph, _The magician’s nephew_ (1955) by C. S. Lewis, the origin story for the Chronicles of Narnia. I read this after finishing _Piranesi_ and the parallels are quite striking. We discover that one character in _Piranesi_ is really called Dr Valentine Andrew Ketterley. In _The magician’s nephew_, the character Dr Andrew Ketterley (or ‘Uncle Andrew’) is the magician whose experiments include sending his nephew Digory and friend Polly off to other worlds. (Digory grows up to be Professor Digory Kirke, whose wardrobe is the access point to Narnia in _The lion, the witch and the wardrobe_.) Other relevant Lewis ideas include the Wood between the Worlds, which is a place of calm or fear for the characters who arrive there in their travels between different worlds. One of these worlds is Charn, where the Witch is summoned, which is similarly formed of ruined halls and statue-like figures. The faun statue from the cover and text of _Piranesi_ also of course hints at the figure of Mr Tumnus, the faun in the snow, who is turned to stone in _The lion, the witch and the wardrobe_ ([1950](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.12#core-R5)). The novel _Piranesi_ ends with a scene in the winter snow.

Clarke has spoken of further inspiration drawn from the short stories of Jorge Luis Borges, particularly the _Labyrinths_ collection ([1962](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.12#core-R1)) and its stories ‘The library of Babel’ (with its ‘indefinite, perhaps infinite’ hexagonal galleries containing all books) and ‘The house of Asterion’, telling of ‘a house like no other on the face of this earth’, ‘the same size as the world’, which Asterion never leaves, and never wants to.

_Piranesi_ also puts me in mind of Mervyn Peake’s _Gormenghast_ trilogy ([1999](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.12#core-R7)) (and Peake’s own illustrations to the same), with its vast Gothic spaces, mysterious wandering figures, catastrophic floods and Hall of Bright Carvings. That trilogy is one of my all-time favourites, and I would rate Clarke’s work right up there with it.

_Prison or sanctuary_

Reading _Piranesi_ in the current world climate is a particularly affecting experience. Here in the UK, we were entering another national lockdown as I was writing this review, having been in various pandemic-limiting measures since the spring. The novel’s setting is itself a strange paradox of limits and freedom. Piranesi is arguably happier in the relative solitude before regaining full knowledge of their true circumstances. By the ending, they are neither fully Piranesi nor their original identity. The House is seen by some as a prison, but by others as a sanctuary from usual worldly stresses and relationships. Susanna Clarke wrote the novel during a period of chronic illness (also explaining the gap between her publications), and she has spoken of the peculiar circumstances of being housebound and not part of the normal world, with a feeling of restriction but also safety, which impacted its writing. Having had my own chronically ill times, I found this personally very relatable, moving and sensitively done.

_Conclusion_

_Piranesi_ is a short and fairly easy read – much shorter than the 1,000-plus-page _Jonathan Strange_, which makes use of lengthy footnotes – but there is considerably more going on within its pages than its size would suggest. Previous fans of Clarke’s style and world-building should love it, and it seems a good place to enter her writing for the new reader. I enjoyed the other literary and artistic allusions that it offers as further avenues to explore. It is certainly a book that will stay with me for its themes of identity, magic, memory, and the search, discovery and navigation of information – a curious puzzle for the reader to solve, detective-like, along with the central figure. How fantastic to have a bestselling novel with an index right at its heart. We all know it can be the key to a Great and Secret Knowledge.

**Indexing mit Word: Ein Handbuch für Textprofis und Anfänger – mit zahlreichen Ratschlägen zum Erstellen guter Register**. Walter Greulich. Hamburg: Tredition, 2020. 343 pp. ISBN 978 3 7439 8319 9 (paperback).€24.90 (Europe), $44.99 (USA).

When driving a car, it is always useful to know what is going on beneath the bonnet. The same goes for indexing in Word while using one of the indexing tools most of us use nowadays. Whatever software you make use of – Index-Manager,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.12#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> WordEmbed<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.12#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> or DEXembed<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.12#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup> – if you do not know anything about the workings of the index module in Word, and things do not work out as they should, you will find yourself in a pretty pickle. That is where Walter Greulich’s book can be of tremendous help.

That said, the book was written with a much more comprehensive goal in mind: indexing with the Word indexing module itself. Usually, the workings of the indexing module take up a few pages in a Word manual at the most. The _Microsoft Word 2019 for Dummies_ on my bookshelf dedicates a scant one and a half pages on how to create an index in Word. Greulich’s book, in contrast, has 321 pages of text and it boasts a professional index, written by the author himself. The book gives a clear and easy-to-understand overview of each step in the creation of a professional index with the Word module. It is enhanced with many tables and illustrations to clarify the actions described in the text.

As the book is written for novices and professionals alike, the first 25 pages describe, very concisely, the rules underlying the indexing process. The next section explains how to create an index entry and delves deeper into the syntax of the XE fields. In the meantime, the author provides useful tips and tricks about good indexing, sorting, cross-referencing, troubleshooting problems and even the ability to see the index as you build it (I always thought this was impossible). Furthermore, he pays attention to what happens to the embedded index when you import the Word file into Framemaker or InDesign. The last part of the book deals with add-ins, such as DEXter,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.12#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup> DEXembed, IndexLinker<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.12#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup> and WordEmbed, the stand-alone program Index-Manager, and useful macros.

It is a thorough guide to everything there is to know about indexing in Word, and as such the book fills a gap in my bookcase. I will often use it when I have questions or encounter problems while using Index-Manager, as the extensive index makes it a wonderful reference work. For the English-language indexers, I hope that an English translation will not take too long in materializing.
