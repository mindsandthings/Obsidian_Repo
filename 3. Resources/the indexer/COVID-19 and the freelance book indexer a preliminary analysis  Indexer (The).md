## Abstract

No sector of the economy has been immune to the effects of COVID-19, but the indexing profession has been in a better position than many to cope with the pandemic. Freelance book indexers were already used to working from home and juggling conflicting demands, and the worldwide survey reported here found that for many their working lives had not changed a great deal. Indeed, some were benefiting from an increased workflow. However, there is also evidence of stress and anxiety, and some scheduled projects being delayed or cancelled, leading to ongoing worries about work drying up and concomitant financial concerns. Indexing societies are shown to have played an important role during this period, with online resources providing both social and professional support. The book-publishing industry, within which indexing is one small part, has had to adapt to the new normal, not least by expanding its digital output, and although uncertainties remain, the outlook appears to be reasonably positive.

As lockdown restrictions were imposed around the world to reduce the spread of COVID-19, millions of employees suddenly found themselves spending a large part of the day at home, either working or on furlough. By and large, freelance book indexers were already working from home, enjoying the independence and freedom. On the face of it, their working environments had not changed, but the challenges that home-based freelancers were used to dealing with, from slipped schedules and shortened deadlines, to juggling the demands of work and family, just got a whole lot worse. Many found the peace of their home offices shattered by partners or children, demanding attention, requiring workspace or creating a distraction simply by being there. In addition, enforced isolation posed additional physical and emotional burdens, and anxiety about production schedules and workflows could not be ignored. As [Dawn Dobbins (2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.39#core-R1): 314–15) suggested in the postscript to her recent article, COVID-19 ‘will have a huge impact on our lives, economically, emotionally and psychologically, for years to come’. Like the families of many home-based freelancers, hers was ‘faced with a number of challenges: how to organize our household, how to give each person both “work” and “relaxation” space, and dealing with basics like shopping for food and ensuring vulnerable relatives were safe and provided for’.

Shortly before the lockdown was imposed in the UK, Society of Indexers secretary Philippa Jevons started a new thread on the main SI discussion forum, SIdeline: ‘Isolation and COVID-19: the solidarity and chat thread’. The rationale for this was:

> because SI is here to provide a support network for indexers and not purely professionally, here is an explicitly off-topic thread for rolling conversation while we all try to adjust to and weather the extraordinary pandemic situation. Just because we already (mostly) work from home, it doesn’t mean that this will be plain sailing as social and community events and spaces are cancelled and closed, and as family and home situations change.

Discussion ran for over a month, as indexers exchanged ideas on coping strategies and generally supported one another as they adapted to what was becoming a new way of life.

In order to get a more detailed picture of how indexers around the world were responding to the pandemic, and the effect it was having on workflows, links to an online survey were circulated to all the indexing societies around the world through the International Committee of Representatives of Indexing Societies (ICRIS). The results reported here reflect indexers’ experience in the first months of the pandemic, up to the end of July 2020.

## Respondents’ backgrounds

Although around half the responses came from UK-based indexers, experiences from 14 different countries were represented in the survey ([Table 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.39#T1)). The majority of respondents were well established: over two-thirds had been indexing for over ten years (and 37 per cent for over 20 years), but a significant proportion (14 per cent) were relative newcomers, with less than five years’ experience. Not surprisingly, just over a quarter combined indexing with related freelance work such as editing and proofreading, and in terms of time spent on indexing in a typical week (pre-lockdown), 43 per cent classified themselves as full-time freelance indexers (> 30 hours/week) and 39 per cent as part-time (10–30 hours), while 18 per cent typically spent less than 10 hours a week on indexing.

## The impact of lockdown on indexers’ working environments

Many indexers will share the sentiments of one respondent, who was grateful for having an ‘already flexible job and being used to working from home before lockdown’, compared to friends ‘who have had to adjust to working from home abruptly’. But although we are used to working from home, lockdown restrictions have required many freelancers to adapt to sharing the family home with partners and children throughout the working day, often for many months. For the indexers responding to this survey, however, just over half did not actually face this problem, perhaps because they were living alone, or because they were already sharing the family home during the working day, maybe living with a retired partner. For the remainder, it was most commonly partners who were now working from home (69 per cent); in addition, nearly half of those with partners at home were also coping with children, predominantly school-age children, but also including some under-fives and adult children (such as students returning from university). One heartfelt comment reflected a view that cannot have been unique: ‘I have felt less productive when working due to constant interruptions. My teenager just can’t get the hang of not asking me stuff when I’m working, even though his father is in the house as well!’

Surprisingly, almost two-thirds of indexers sharing their family homes during the working day felt that it hadn’t significantly affected their work, although several were having to share their workspace and/or equipment. The main impact seems to have been on concentration, with many finding it harder to focus on work ([Table 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.39#T2)). As one respondent stated, ‘The hardest thing is simply not being able to rely on the longer chunks of time that I used to get when the house was empty – much harder to concentrate with constant interruptibility.’ One indexer was ‘experimenting with listening to “focus/study” music channels with a headset in order to shut out the sound of my husband’s conference calls’.

Table 2. The impact of having to share the family home during the working day (N = 100)[\*](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.39#tfn-2-1)

| Impact | Percentage of respondents citing |
| --- | --- |
| It has not significantly affected my work | 58 |
| I have found it harder to focus on work | 34 |
| I have had to change my normal working hours (e.g. working evenings) | 16 |
| I have had to incorporate supervising children’s school work into my working day | 15 |
| I have had to share my workspace | 14 |
| I have had to reduce my working hours | 12 |
| I have had to share my equipment (computers, etc.) | 7 |
| I have had to negotiate later deadlines | 5 |
| I have had to take a complete break from freelance work | 3 |

In the early weeks of the pandemic, anxiety and difficulties in focusing on the task in hand were common reactions, whether or not the working environment was disrupted. There was certainly a temptation, as one respondent confessed, to spending ‘far too much time twitching at news and being tempted to read news stories every time I went on the Internet’. By contrast, some indexers found that with fewer commitments outside the house they actually had _more_ time for work: ‘The house is busier and I’ve had more interruptions, but I’ve actually had a lot more time, as I haven’t had to take children to school/other activities.’ Another explained that there was more time for work because ‘I don’t have to leave my home to go to meetings – they now all take place on Zoom!’

Some indexers were able to mitigate the impact of sharing their working environment by adopting practical solutions to make it easier for more members of the household to work and study from home, mainly by converting other rooms into workspaces (cited by 22 respondents). With more people working and studying online (or even simply using the Internet for communication and leisure), extra demands were placed on broadband and wi-fi networks. Several respondents had upgraded their broadband and/or extended their wi-fi networks to alleviate the problem, and the purchase of additional PCs or laptops was another solution adopted, particularly by those with school-age children needing to complete schoolwork.

Despite the widespread use of the Internet as a reference source, one lockdown problem noted by a respondent was lack of access to libraries, while indexing a book that ‘covered many super-specialist periods etc. that I didn’t know a lot about. Normally in these circumstances I would have gone to local libraries and found specialist books on those, and looked at how things were indexed.’

## Work schedules and relations with clients

The second section of the survey focused on how the disruption associated with the pandemic was impacting work schedules. The ability of the wider publishing industry to cope with the economic impact of lockdown would ultimately have an effect on indexers’ future prospects. In his introduction to the _Publishers Association Yearbook 2019_, CEO Stephen Lotinga was upbeat in reflecting on publishing’s response to the challenges of 2020:

> The 2019 data on the publishing industry shows that we entered into this challenging period in a strong position and, while it has been difficult, we are in the best shape we have ever been in to weather this storm … Despite the uncertainty and the many challenges facing the industry, we remain optimistic about the future. The current crisis has clearly demonstrated that people need and want books. They offer education, entertainment and comfort. Publishing remains vital.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.39#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup>

In the SI newsletter, _SIdelights_, SI president and literary editor of _The Spectator_ Sam Leith worried about indexers’ work drying up as book publication schedules were thrown into turmoil:

> There has been – at least looking at it from my end of the process as a literary editor – a veritable Twilight of the Publication Dates. What, in February, was looking like a nice solid publication schedule for the months ahead went all to hell in the space of the first fortnight of lockdown. This book was pushed back to September; that book was held over till the summer of next year; the odd one (almost anything with the word ‘virus’ in the title, mostly) suddenly shot forward to the middle of next week. Warehousing, printing, shipping, distribution, cash-flow: publishers were in all sorts of trouble about all of it. ([Leith, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.39#core-R3): 2)

Apart from anything else, delaying publication dates seemed to make sense; with bookshops closed, and book fairs and literary festivals cancelled, how were readers to find out about new books and get hold of them? As one Canadian indexer commented, ‘There is some concern in the Canadian editing/publishing community that the fallout from bookstore closures due to COVID-19 may continue to ripple through the industry for the next few seasons, as orders fall and publishers’ cash flow is affected.’ However, some book-related events, notably the world-famous Hay Festival, were able to reinvent themselves as digital events, with a stellar cast of speakers and links to the bookseller Waterstones, thus helping to stimulate the book trade.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.39#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> Similarly, in the US, _Publishers Weekly_ reported that planned conferences, festivals and awards events were moving online.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.39#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup>

Of those responding to questions on workflows, 62 per cent felt that scheduled work had not been significantly affected. However, 33 per cent were experiencing delays and 5 per cent had had work cancelled. There were a variety of reasons for delays:

•

‘One piece of work was cancelled, as the author wanted to revise the text to include material on coronavirus.’

•

‘Scheduled work was delayed during indexing stage due to the indexer (me) contracting COVID-19.’

•

‘I was told by one publisher to expect delays as the typesetters in India were having to get used to working from home.’

•

‘One indexing job was delayed early on in our lockdown because the author (in China) was indisposed directly due to Covid-19.’

As far as new commissions were concerned, the situation was similar, with 56 per cent of respondents being offered about the same amount of work and 34 per cent getting less. Interestingly, 10 per cent were being offered more work than usual, perhaps reflecting a rush to publish topical, pandemic-related books. One respondent, speculating that fewer indexers might be available during the lockdown, was so overwhelmed with offers of work that ‘I turn down three jobs for every one I can accept’. Another had ‘had a few projects delayed and one project cancelled, but have also had the busiest spring that I’ve ever had’. Several respondents reported that although their workload had not changed, they had a different mix of clients, but some were more gloomy: ‘Work is only trickling in and I cannot remember it being as quiet as this since getting my first commission.’

These results were similar to those reported by [Jim Fuhr (2020)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.39#core-R2), who had begun asking members of the American Society for Indexing how COVID-19 was affecting their indexing workloads and/or incomes. His initial analysis of early responses suggested both positive and negative impacts. Some indexers’ workloads were increasing as publishers speeded up production to avoid delays associated with anticipated slowdowns in the economy. And although some indexers were experiencing only minor reductions in workloads, others reported delays in large indexing jobs, the suspension of a publisher’s activities until June, indexes being submitted with no feedback from authors or project managers, and declining workloads. There were also concerns that problems could get worse in the future.

Uncertainty about the future was also apparent in the present survey, with almost a quarter saying ‘don’t know’. Although an optimistic 10 per cent expected to be offered more work, and almost half expected it to remain about the same, almost 20 per cent expected less work. Several of those expecting more work anticipated the pandemic generating many projects related to the various aspects of COVID-19 (from medical and scientific to sociological and economic):

> Part of me thinks there will be more work in the future, but I have no hard evidence for that. Only the feeling that the amount of information being generated right now is enormous. At some point it will have to be organized, published and made accessible. We have an opportunity here, but it’s a fuzzy one at this point.

On the other hand, with the pandemic impacting university finances, one indexer working with academic authors worried that ‘in the coming year they will have fewer grant opportunities available from their institutions to help offset the cost of hiring indexers and will choose to index their books themselves’. Indeed, with staff redundancies, academic output could also be reduced.

## The bottom line: financial implications

Turning to the financial implications associated with the pandemic, as judged in the middle of the year, 11 percent of respondents did not feel in a position to make a prediction. As one stated, ‘My gut feel is that my income will be lower this year, but who knows when publishing houses get back into full swing? I might find myself suddenly swamped – I really couldn’t call it.’

Around a third of respondents did not feel it would have any effect on their indexing income but as many as 43 per cent estimated that it was likely to be a lot lower (12 per cent) or slightly lower (31 per cent) than normal, while only 14 per cent anticipated it being higher (though only 3 per cent thought it would be ‘much higher’). On the whole, these responses reflected indexers’ current and anticipated workloads, with the more pessimistic estimates relating to less work currently being offered. However, those heading towards retirement were less concerned: ‘I had planned to earn less this year as I worked less and got closer to retirement, so I’m not feeling an impact.’ On the other hand, one indexer had ‘intended to pack it in at the end of this year, but the value of my pension has fallen so may not be able to’.

In addition to government-funded furlough schemes and various forms of support for employers during these difficult economic times, schemes were also set up to help the self-employed; almost a quarter of respondents had been able to access support from such a scheme, though just over a third did not consider that they were eligible.

Several respondents commented on payment delays and difficulties in chasing late payments due to in-house staff also working from home. On indexing rates, one US indexer was realistic: ‘I doubt rates will go up. We are not an industry with the clout to demand premium wages.’ Many respondents were quite philosophical about the possibility of a reduced income, pointing out that their expenditure would also be lower, ‘given the shutdown of pubs and restaurants, together with cultural outlets’. And with fewer commitments outside the home, and little opportunity for travel and holidays, it was also possible to take on more work than normal. As one UK indexer stated, ‘I felt I needed to take on as much work as I could in case the bottom fell out of it, or I got sick at some point. Consequently my income for the first part of this year has been higher than normal.’ This proved to be counterproductive, however, as ‘I’m now exhausted and will be taking the summer off work altogether to recover.’

## Relations with other indexers: combating isolation

### Online forums

Although 30 or 40 years ago many indexers rarely communicated with other members of the profession unless they were avid conference goers, today the opportunities to combat isolation have expanded considerably with the development of online forums and events. During the pandemic online forums might have been expected to become more important, as evidenced by the SIdeline thread mentioned above, though as many as 17 per cent of respondents stated that they never participated in these anyway. For the regular participants, around three-quarters felt that their level of activity had been about the same as normal, while almost equal proportions had been more active (12 per cent) and less active (10 per cent).

### Conferences and meetings

It became apparent in March that planned face-to-face meetings would have to be cancelled and the American Society for Indexing, the Indexing Society of Canada/Société canadienne d’indexation and the Society of Indexers all regretfully announced the cancellation of their conferences. For over half the respondents, this was of no consequence: they either did not feel it had affected them (25 per cent) or rarely/never attended meetings or conferences (34 per cent). For the remainder, missing meeting/networking with indexing colleagues was the predominant response (cited by 72 per cent). But conferences and meetings are not just about socializing and networking; around half those missing these aspects were also missing the intellectual stimulation. For a small proportion of respondents (13 per cent) it was only the intellectual stimulation that they were missing. It is difficult to separate intellectual stimulation from CPD; for 15 per cent of those missing face-to-face meetings, it was only the loss of opportunities for CPD that was significant.

To compensate for the absence of face-to-face meetings, ASI was quick off the mark to organize an online conference (see [Li, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.39#core-R4)). This was well attended, with almost a third of respondents to this present survey having participated in the event, three-quarters of whom found it very/quite useful ([Table 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.39#T3)). Various other formal and informal online events were arranged, from online peer-review exercises to Zoom chats, with more respondents attending social/informal meetings than training-oriented events and generally finding them useful/valuable.

Looking ahead, many commented on the need for a vaccine before they would feel comfortable attending any face-to-face events, though around half felt it was very/quite likely that they would attend local conferences or meetings in 2021, assuming these took place. There was less enthusiasm for national events requiring longer journeys and/or an overnight stay, while only about 10 per cent of respondents thought it was very/quite likely that they would attend an overseas conference. However, on the plus side, several respondents felt that online events would become increasingly important and effective, giving indexers in more isolated locations the chance to participate that they had previously been denied.

## Looking after number one: health and welfare

During the pandemic and associated disruption to ‘normal’ life a common reaction has been an increase in levels of stress and anxiety, which can indirectly affect overall health and the ability to work effectively. This was particularly apparent during the early stages of the pandemic, as people adjusted to the sudden change in their way of life. It could be argued that these effects may be felt more acutely by freelancers without access to support services from employers. Many respondents admitted to feeling anxious, and stressed and frustrated by the restrictions and difficulties of everyday life: ‘I found the whole experience very stressful: noise distractions from work phone calls by husband; every downstairs space in use for work/study. I felt we “lost” our home during this time – not good for mental health at all.’

Despite suffering from anxiety and stress, many respondents also appreciated the less frenetic pace of life and the chance to enjoy simple pleasures. Indeed, the most frequently cited response (by over half of respondents) was the therapeutic effects of spending time on simple activities in the local area ([Table 4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.39#T4)). As one respondent commented,

> Some of my answers may seem contradictory. Yes, it is stressful and frustrating, but at the same time I’ve found it more relaxing: the quiet (no cars, no planes) is so soothing. I shall miss that when, and if, we return to normal (whatever that once was).

| --- | --- |
| I’ve found spending time on simple activities in my local area (walking, gardening, etc.) therapeutic | 57 |
| I’ve found the restrictions on everyday activities frustrating | 49 |
| I’ve been anxious about the risk of contracting COVID-19 | 45 |
| I’ve found the problems associated with everyday tasks (e.g. obtaining groceries) time-consuming | 38 |
| I’ve enjoyed spending more time with my children/partner | 26 |
| I’ve enjoyed having time to catch up on household and work-related administrative tasks | 26 |
| I’ve been anxious about the long-term impact of COVID-19 on my financial situation | 25 |
| I’ve found life more relaxing | 25 |
| I’ve found the problems associated with everyday tasks stressful | 23 |
| I’ve felt very isolated | 17 |
| I’ve enjoyed getting involved in new activities | 13 |

The therapeutic effects of indexing itself were noted by some. ‘Fortunately, I love indexing, and focusing on my work is therapeutic. However, it does not make up for the deep emotional losses I am experiencing.’ And another commented, ‘Frankly, it’s been awful but I’ve been fortunate to have a couple of interesting books in the jobs that have come in these past months.’

Although it was thought inappropriate to ask specific questions about whether respondents or family members had contracted COVID-19, several volunteered the information. One commented, ‘I have been suffering from Long Term Covid since March, though this has not affected my ability to work. On the contrary, I am glad I could work from home and choose my hours when not sleeping.’

The indexer who stated, ‘Would really like a break from the other people in my house!’ cannot be the only one feeling like this, and many will sympathize with the mixed feelings expressed by another respondent:

> It has been great to hang out with my teenage son more but I have felt bad for him not being able to attend school and concerned about his mental wellbeing. As I’ve been trying to get as much work done as possible (as who knows what’s around the corner), I feel I’ve neglected overlooking his schoolwork quite a bit so feel guilty about that.

As freelancers used to working from home, and still getting work, several respondents were thankful to have chosen a career in indexing: ‘I feel more fortunate and grateful than ever to have this job right now. It’s done me good to disappear into interesting books at such a strange and difficult time.’ They were more worried for other people, concerned for their children’s future and, indeed, the future of humanity in general, with one respondent commenting, ‘What is really frustrating is seeing the negative aspects of human behaviour’.

## COVID, covid or coronavirus? How do we index the pandemic?

Great social change is often associated with great linguistic change; within a very short time, terminology related to COVID-19 and its impact was common currency, so much so that the Oxford English Dictionary released an update ahead of its normal schedule and was planning a webinar to explain the rationale behind this. As one survey respondent noted, ‘I’ve never seen a set of new terminology appear so rapidly. I went from “oh, there’s the first mention of it” to extremely quickly every single book I’m working on having a mention, no matter what the subject.’

It was in late May that SI internet director Ruth Ellis started a new thread on the SIdeline forum, ‘First to index the pandemic?’, noting that the authors of (delayed) proofs had made last-minute changes to include the pandemic. She intended to use ‘COVID-19’, in line with the text usage, and wondered what the preferred term would turn out to be. The survey provided an opportunity to look into this question. Around a quarter of respondents had already been working on material that included references to the pandemic, which, not surprisingly, was referred to in a variety of ways, with indexers generally following the text usage, plus cross-references as appropriate. Although, as one respondent pointed out, ‘COVID-19’ is the ‘official’ term, as used by the World Health Organization (and in the pages of _The Indexer_), it seemed that ‘Covid-19’, was in more common use, and was being indexed as such, often with cross-references from ‘coronavirus’. The terms ‘coronavirus pandemic’ or ‘Covid-19 pandemic’ were also encountered. More specialized books mainly used the specific virus name ‘SARS-CoV-2’, but also Covid-19/COVID-19, with ‘coronavirus’ referring to the group of viruses. Not surprisingly, terms such as ‘lockdown’, ‘quarantine’, ‘pandemics’, ‘community transmission’, ‘social distancing’ and ‘video conferencing’ were also becoming increasingly common.

One indexer provided a very detailed response to this question:

> Have added the term to a medical thesaurus I work with. The preferred term is ‘covid-19’. Acronyms include ‘2019-nCoV infection’ and ‘coronavirus (2019-nCoV)’ (both of which I got from a partner organisation), ‘Covid-19’ and ‘CoV’ (we use acronyms for different capitalisation as well as for shortening). Synonyms include ‘novel coronavirus’, ‘new coronavirus’, ‘coronavirus, novel’. BT ‘virus diseases’. We already had ‘contact tracing’ (BTs ‘epidemiological functions’, ‘communicable disease control’). I added the term ‘home isolation’ with a note to check ‘Is this useful?’ Your question here prompted me to add ‘lockdown’ as a suggested term, also under ‘communicable disease control’. We already had ‘pandemics’ as a synonym of ‘epidemics’ with BT ‘disease outbreaks’.

## Looking ahead

As _Publishers Weekly_ reported, ‘When the Covid-19 pandemic began to tighten its grip on the U.S. in early spring, most people in publishing were bracing for the worst.’<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.39#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup> However, although sales initially fell, by June they were beginning to pick up again. With digital products becoming an increasingly important part of the mix, and online book-related events taking off, the publishing industry seemed to be emerging from lockdown in reasonable shape, though many staff were continuing to work from home for longer than anticipated. In the UK, Publishers Association CEO Stephen Lotinga, in welcoming ‘the steps the government is taking to support employers and employees’, noted:

> In order to get the publishing industry thriving again we need the government to ensure there is a fair market for books, including support for bookshops. It is also vital that schools have funding for the resources their students need and that publishers are able to access their key overseas markets.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.39#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup>

By late August, SI president Sam Leith felt that publishing was slowly getting used to the ‘new normal’, with ‘the maddest September (with many pushed-back books crowding into the schedules alongside the expected autumn blockbusters) for ages’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.39#fn6" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn6">6</a></sup> But there was no doubt that the industry was having to adapt; as Kathryn Munt reported in late August,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.39#fn7" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn7">7</a></sup> the challenges it was facing included the following:

•

setting up infrastructure for employees working from home, purchasing new equipment, managing teams remotely and enabling more flexible working, especially to accommodate childcare and home schooling

•

the lack of comradeship which comes from and impacts positively on working life

•

the absence of sales visits, events and conferences

•

new workflows and suppliers to facilitate offering backlist content in digital formats, as well as the digital offering for the frontlist

•

more frequent reviews of budgets and forecasts

•

likely cuts in university and library budgets.

She concluded that there will be a longer-term impact on revenues, product and pricing, and on how people work together (with a greater mix of office working and working from home) and with digital playing a far greater role throughout the industry.

As part of the ecology of publishing, how do indexers view their prospects? As with other sections in this survey, there was a mixture of views from those who responded to this question. Some were pessimistic, repeating their worries about work drying up and the possibility of smaller publishers going out of business. Another group, who had been indexing for 20 years or more (and for whom indexing may well have been a second career), saw the pandemic as a reason to contemplate retiring sooner rather than later. However, many remained positive, feeling that as freelancers working from home, their working lives were not going to change dramatically, though some were planning to diversify their skills portfolio or review their client base to concentrate on the ‘good-quality clients who produce good books, pay decent rates and pay on time’. Several felt very fortunate to be in this profession, noting the continuing need for people with indexing skills: ‘It’s work that continues to be important and not that many people can do it well so the demand is still there’.

> Indexing should be able to continue as a viable profession as long as there are materials to index (books, journals, etc.). This means a viable publishing industry, as well as the continued viability of universities and university presses. Reading, whether for education or entertainment, is certainly not going to decrease, so the entire publishing industry will need to be vigilant and adapt as necessary to any potential obstacles thrown up by this health crisis.
