## Abstract

Hadith, the collected traditions of Prophet Muhammad, are the second source of Islamic law after the Qurʾan. The _Sahih_ of al-Bukhari is the most authoritative collection of hadith in Sunni Islam, and _Fath al-Bari_ by Ibn Hajar is one of the most important commentaries on the _Sahih_. While al-Bukhari has been available in English translation since 1971, Ibn Hajar is only being translated now. Ælfwine Mischler was asked to write multiple indexes for the translation of this multi-volume classic Islamic text. In this article, she describes the nature of Ibn Hajar’s work, some of the challenges in indexing it, and her solutions for writing both cumulative and single-volume indexes.

The fifteenth-century (ce) _Fath al-Bari_ by Ibn Hajar al-ʿAsqalani is one of the most important commentaries on the ninth-century (ce) _Sahih_ of al-Bukhari, the most authoritative collection of hadith in Sunni Islam.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.17#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> While al-Bukhari’s work has been available in English translation since 1971, _Fath al-Bari_ has not been translated until now. I was asked to write multiple indexes for this multi-volume work. This is a challenging task, not only because of the size of the work, but also because of its nature. This article is written after completing the first volume – both cumulative indexes and one for the first volume alone – and starting on the second volume.

## Background

### Hadith

Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam, was born in Mecca in 570 ce and began to receive revelation at the age of 40. Persecuted by the ruling tribe in Mecca, Muhammad and the Muslims made the emigration or Hijrah to Medina in 622, which became the first year in the Islamic calendar. Muhammad died of natural causes in Medina in 632 ce.

For Muslims, the Qurʾan is the direct revelation from God through the Angel Gabriel to the Prophet Muhammad. The Qurʾan directs Muslims to follow the example of the Prophet, whose utterances and actions are known as the _sunna_. Muslims who lived far from Medina or after the time of the Prophet depended on oral transmissions of his words and deeds. These reports or traditions are known as hadith (Arabic _ḥadīth_; plural _aḥadīth_; in English _hadith_ is both singular and collective plural), and they are the second source of Islamic law after the Qurʾan. (The third and fourth sources are consensus of the community and reasoning by analogy; see [Jaques, 2009](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.17#core-r2): 4–5.) The hadith were collected, memorized, and studied by numerous scholars.

For Sunni Muslims, the most authoritative collection of hadith is the compilation made by Abu ʿAbd Allah Muhammad ibn Ismaʿil al-Bukhari (ah 194–256/810–70 ce),<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.17#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> known simply as al-Bukhari. Having gathered approximately 600,000 traditions, he selected about 7,275 that he considered completely reliable to include in his _Al-Jamiʿ al-Sahih_ (The Authentic Collection), also known as the _Sahih_.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.17#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup>

### Transmission chain and content

Every hadith has two parts: the chain of transmitters (Arabic _isnād_, pl. _asānīd_), and the content (_matn_, pl. _mutūn_). Everything the Prophet said or did was a form of revelation, and therefore the _matn_ was not generally subjected to criticism. Traditionalists evaluated the soundness of hadith on the _isnād_, ensuring that the transmitters were reliable and could have been in the same place at the same time ([Jaques, 2009](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.17#core-r2): 4–5).

### Companions and Followers

The first narrators of hadith were the Companions, those Muslims who were contemporaneous with the Prophet and saw, met, or interacted with him. The Followers (also known as Successors) were of the next generation. To be designated a Follower, one had to personally know at least one Companion.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.17#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup> Ibn Hajar’s commentary identifies narrators as Companions or Followers.

### _Ibn Hajar and_ Fath _al-Bari_

Ibn Hajar al-ʿAsqalani was born in Cairo in ah 773/1372 ce, during the Mamluk period ([Jaques, 2009](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.17#core-r2): 25). He became one of the best-known scholars of his time, and was the chief Shafʿi judge – the most powerful judicial position in the Empire – for nearly 25 years. He authored approximately 500 books, most of which are lost. By far his most important work was _Fath al-Bari_ (Victory of the Creator), which was based on the lectures he gave and took more than 25 years to complete. Kings and sultans commissioned copies of it long before it was complete. When he died in Cairo in ah 852/1449 ce, just short of his 78th birthday, over 50,000 people attended his funeral, including the Mamluk sultan and the caliph (religious figurehead) ([Jaques, 2009](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.17#core-r2): 1–2).

_Fath al-Bari_ is a commentary on al-Bukhari. The _Sahih_ collection is just that – a compilation of hadith, arranged by topic, but with no explanations. The reader is sometimes left wondering why a hadith was gathered under a given chapter heading or what lessons are to be learned from it. Ibn Hajar believed that al-Bukhari had a method and a reason for reporting the hadiths he did, in the order he did. Ibn Hajar explains these apparent digressions. He identifies the transmitters and sometimes gives background information on them. He gives variations in wording among different narrations, explains unusual words and difficult points of grammar, and identifies the lessons learned from each hadith.

### _Structure of_ Fath al-Bari

The Arabic text has 97 books published in 14 volumes. The English translation is expected to take 15 to 20 volumes. According to the publisher who commissioned me, the translator has completed eight books. Volume 1 was published a few years ago with inadequate indexes. The plan is to reprint Volume 1 with the new indexes that I write, along with volumes 2 and 3 during 2021. Another two or three volumes will be published each year, and cumulative indexes will be published at the end of the project.

In the Arabic text, the first volume (unnumbered) is an introduction called ‘Hadi al-Sari’ (The Traveller’s Guide), followed by several ‘indexes’ (actually closer to detailed tables of contents<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.17#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup>) and lists of the hadith narrators. The commentary begins in the second volume.

In the English translation, Volume 1 contains a biography of Ibn Hajar written by one of his students, the beginning chapters of ‘The Traveller’s Guide’, and two brief biographies of al-Bukhari. The remainder of ‘The Traveller’s Guide’, the lists, and ‘indexes’ in the Arabic first volume will be included in the final volume of the translation.

## Indexing decisions

My instructions were to produce four indexes, both cumulative and for the individual volumes: a General Index and three specialized ones covering names, works, and places. The specialized indexes would not have subentries. The General Index would be indented style, with two levels of subentries. In discussions with the publisher, via Zoom and email, we agreed on several points, many of which were my suggestions.

The most important of these was the form of the locators. I suggested that they have four parts in the cumulative index, three in the individual indexes: volume number of the translation, book number given by Ibn Hajar, chapter number given by Ibn Hajar, and page number. My reasoning was that some readers might want to refer to the original Arabic, and providing the book and chapter numbers would enable them to do so more easily. Book and chapter numbers could also be used for an online index if the work is later made available in HTML (something the publisher is considering in the future). The book number might also give the user some idea of whether the discussion is likely to be major or minor, depending on whether the discussion falls in the book that focuses on the topic. For example, Book 3 is the Book of Knowledge. If the locator of a subentry under ‘knowledge’ has a different book number, the discussion there is likely to be briefer than if it is in Book 3.

The introductory material did not have book numbers, and I did not want to lump them all together as ‘Intro’. Rather than numbers I used initials, with an explanation of these in the note at the beginning of each index: IH (biography of Ibn Hajar), TG (Traveller’s Guide), and IB (biography of Imam al-Bukhari). In order for these to sort properly, I had to use hidden text: five zeros plus a letter A, B, or C for IH, TG, or IB, respectively (using Sky 8 indexing software).

When I began to work on Book 1, I found that the first few chapters were not clearly distinguished. In later chapters and in Book 3, each chapter began on a new page with some decorative elements to distinguish it. Although this was the layout in the Arabic, I asked the publisher to format the beginning of all chapters the same way, and while the designer was doing this, I started indexing Book 3. When the new PDF arrived, the page numbers that had already been indexed in Book 3 had to be incremented by two, but this was easier than it would have been to repaginate if I had started in Book 1.

I was already familiar with al-Bukhari, owning a copy of the translation and having read much of it years ago. This proved useful in anticipating entries in future volumes, choosing some terms, and structuring some entries.

I discuss each index below, starting with the shorter, specialized indexes.

### Places Index

In Volume 1 the Places Index was quite short, only about 300 records in a 500-page book. The original Places Index had contained not only countries and cities, but also mosques, places in the hajj rituals, and a cemetery. I put the mosques and locations of hajj rituals in the General Index, as well as sites of battles and treaties, because the rituals, battles, and treaties were important subjects, whereas the locations in the Places Index were of less importance. Late in the indexing I decided to add a subentry for narrators from a given place, as this was a point that Ibn Hajar frequently mentioned. Thus a city or country could have many undifferentiated locators, but there would be a subentry ‘narrators from’, and in at least one case also ‘grammarians from’.

### Works Index

This index was also much shorter than General and Names indexes, as works were usually cited by the author rather than the title. I did not include references to _Fath al-Bari_, though there were a few references to other works by Ibn Hajar. The commentary often discussed variations in wording between different versions of a hadith, and occasionally reference was made to ‘the two _Sahih_s’. This refers to the two hadith collections by al-Bukhari (the subject of _Fath al-Bari_) and by Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj, usually called simply Muslim. After some debate and confirmation from the publisher, I decided to index these solely under ‘_Sahih_ (Muslim)’ because the whole work is about al-Bukhari.

In the Works Index, I put a _see also_ cross-reference to the author in the Names Index, and a reciprocal cross-reference in the Names Index to the author’s works in the Works Index.

There were often several books with the same title but different authors, so I always included the author’s name in parentheses after a work. In one case I could not determine the author from the wording in the text – there were two names in the paragraph and it was not clear who ‘he’ and ‘his’ were regarding the book. A quick search on the Internet did not help. It appeared that what was given as a title was a type of book, and there were several by that title from the medieval period. I had to leave a query after the title.

### Names Index

This is by far the most unusual feature of the indexes, possibly a unique feature. If any other hadith collections or commentaries are ever indexed, they will likely need a name index such as this one. For Volume 1 I had approximately 6,000 records in the Names Index, amounting to over 2,000 names (using the paragraph count in Word). However, that does not mean that there were over 2,000 different individuals, as explained below.

#### Which names to include?

For hadith scholars, the names in the chains of transmission are essential information, and there was no question that every name in every chain should be indexed.

The content of a hadith often contains one or more names, reporting on how someone interacted with the Prophet. That person may or may not also be the narrator. For example, when ʿAʾisha, a wife of the Prophet, reports a conversation she had with him, her name appears both in the chain and in the content. But in another case, a Companion might report a conversation that he witnessed between the Prophet and a third person, who may or may not be named. The Companion would only appear in the chain of the hadith.

But what about names of people in the hadith who lived before the time of the Prophet, such as earlier prophets that Muhammad spoke about? Where should their names appear? What about contemporary rulers that the Prophet sent letters to? Should they be in the Names Index or the General Index? Where to index Satan or Gabriel when the Prophet spoke about them? And should Companions and Followers be distinguished from later narrators and Ibn Hajar’s sources?

After some reflection, I decided that the Names Index should include only humans (not angels or devils), and only people who were contemporaries of the Prophet or later (not earlier prophets), but not rulers (governors, kings, emperors) who were mentioned in hadith. These excluded beings would be in the General Index, and their names would appear in the Names Index only with a s_ee_ cross-reference to the General Index. This meant that the Names Index was primarily an index of narrators and sources, such as previous commentators that Ibn Hajar relied on.

Early on I tried to distinguish the later sources and narrators from Companions and Followers by marking them with an asterisk, but I soon realized that I could not do this without specialized knowledge of who they were and removed the asterisks.

#### Every name

In the introductory books, there were several paragraphs that were just lists of names – people that Ibn Hajar had studied under, or whose books he had studied, or who praised him. I questioned whether these should be included, but decided that they might be of significance to some scholars. In fact, they often appeared later as sources, though in a different form, as explained in the section on multiple names below. Fortunately, the Split feature in Sky made it easy to copy and index such lists. In short, I decided that for this work, there was no such thing as a passing mention of a name. Every one of them had to be in the Names Index (see [Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.17#F1)).

#### An exception

In Volume 1 I came to a passage in which the Prophet says that he saw his deceased wife Khadija ‘in a house encrusted with pearls (_qaṣab_), containing neither clamour nor hardship’ (Volume 1, p. 122). Ibn Hajar then gives al-Bukhari’s explanation of the meaning of _qaṣab_ and states that more will be said about this in the chapter on the virtues of Khadija. This was clearly different from the usual mention of someone in a hadith: Khadija here was neither an interlocutor nor a narrator. A check in the table of contents of al-Bukhari showed that there is a whole book on the virtues of various Companions in a later volume. I indexed this material in the General Index as ‘virtues of Khadīja’ – in anticipation of a much larger ‘virtues’ entry in the future – with a cross-reference ‘s_ee also_ Khadīja bint Khuwaylid in Names Index’. I also included the locator for this material in the Names Index under her name.

#### Multiple names for one person

Medieval Arabic names are complex (see [Mischler, 2021](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.17#core-r3)), and a person might be referred to by some form of nickname, especially a _kunya_ consisting of Abu (father of) or Umm (mother of) and the name of their oldest son or a characterisic. In another context the same person might be referred to by a different nickname, or by Ibn (son of) or Bint (daughter of) and their father’s name. The same name might occur another time with the grandfather’s name or a further descriptive name (_nisba_) designating a tribe or place of origin. Do these names refer to the same person, or is the addition there to distinguish two people?

In the first printing of Volume 1, the (incomplete) Names Index had a note at the beginning to the effect that names were indexed as they appear in the text, and the same person might be listed under several names, a practice the publisher asked me to continue. The study of who was who among the narrators is a specialized field, and only an expert would be able to sort them all out. Ibn Hajar has some such lists in the yet untranslated parts of the first volume, so the reader might be able to get this information in the last volume if those sections are translated.

This was a big relief to me, because I could not imagine how I was going to sort out all of the many names – and this was before I had started indexing and had not realized how many names there were and how many of them needed a specialist’s knowledge to sort them out. Often only a first name is given, and there is no way for a non-specialist to know who the person is, as there are several others with the same first name. So only the first name is indexed.

However, as I proceeded, it became clear that there were some multiple names that obviously belonged to the same person. Many of the names were given on first mention by the _kunya_ and the person was later referred to by his given name or as Ibn plus his father’s name. I did not change any of these without confirming with the publisher first. In one case he told me not to assume that the name Ahmad alone was Ahmad ibn Hanbal unless it was preceded by ‘Imam’ or mentioned along with the book for which he is known. This may have been overly cautious, because the many times I have seen the name Ahmad alone (so far), it was clear from the context that it was not a narrator but a scholar who was being cited. In the few cases where it was clear from the context that the name Ahmad was not referring to Ibn Hanbal, he was identified as the son of someone or by another name. However, I followed the client’s instructions and did not combine these names.

Another example shows how important it is to not assume too much in this index. A transmission chain began with the single name ʿUthman, with no further name given in the commentary, which is unusual. I queried whether something had been left out. This could not be ʿUthman ibn ʿAffan because he was a Companion, so his name would be at the end of a chain. The publisher’s reply was that this was ʿUthman ibn Abi Shayba, whose brother Abu Bakr is cited frequently as simply Ibn Abi Shayba. I had indexed this ʿUthman ibn Abi Shayba and had wondered whether he could be combined with Ibn Abi Shayba. Now I knew that these were separate people.

Shortly before I submitted the Volume 1 indexes to the publisher, he advised me that he was going to have a scholar check the names. In some cases I had written queries in note text (visible to me in the software but not printed) about combining two forms of a name that appeared to be the same person. In the editing stage, I changed the notes I wanted to keep into small caps, and in the Word document I changed the color of the small caps to red so that the editor would see my queries.

Another characteristic of medieval Arabic names is that titles and honorifics are often placed before a name. These had to be recognized and dropped, as they are not used as entry points. Some of these dropped elements were Shaykh, Imam, and al-Taqi.

#### Single names for well-known people

Some well-known people usually appeared with only a first name: Abu Bakr, ʿUmar, ʿUthman, ʿAli, Anas, Malik. After confirming with the publisher, I added their second names: Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, ʿUmar ibn al-Khattab, ʿUthman ibn ʿAffan, ʿAli ibn Abi Talib (these four were the Rightly Guided Caliphs after the Prophet), Anas ibn Malik (a prolific narrator of hadith), and Malik ibn Anas (son of the former, the founder of the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence).

#### Subentries

The publisher and I had agreed that the names would be indexed without subentries. However, some of them had dozens of locators. Many of these I had predicted because the names of the more prolific hadith narrators and prominent scholars are known to me. I decided that before starting on Volume 2, I would create subentries by volume for these names; otherwise the entries will be next to impossible to read. The subentry is simply the word _**volume**_ in bold italic, the same as is used for the volume number. Each volume is preceded by its number in hidden text (01volume, 02volume, etc.) to sort it.

### General (subject) Index

#### Metatopics

In some ways this index was easier than others I have done because I did not have to worry about structuring it around a metatopic. I knew before starting that each book would have its own long entry, and I needed one or more headings about hadith studies. These were perhaps the most difficult. After seeing what was presented, I decided to include general information about hadith status (whether a hadith was sound, good, weak, mass-transmitted, etc., mostly related to the chain of transmission), but not the status of every hadith mentioned in the book. In fact, I found that often the status of any given hadith was not mentioned in the text.

Most of these entries came from the introductory ‘Traveller’s Guide’:

The Prophet appears in every hadith, either as an actor or as the subject of others’ speech, so under his name I planned to have primarily major life events, but not every action. Volume 1 had these entries:

> Muḥammad, Prophet
> 
> death of
> 
> description of
> 
> Farewell Pilgrimage
> 
> final illness
>

> to Khusraw
> 
> sealing of

> most knowledgeable of Allah
> 
> sent to all people
> 
> signet ring of
> 
> virtues of

#### Subentries for books

With few exceptions, Ibn Hajar’s chapter headings follow those of al-Bukhari, and I used these chapter headings in the first draft as subentries for the book topic. When I had indexed a whole book, I then went through these and grouped them, leaving the sub-subentries for more details. The index for the Book of Knowledge had chapter headings such as ‘answering after finishing a conversation’, ‘answering while seated on a mount’, ‘answering while stoning columns’ (in a hajj ritual), ‘asking while standing’, ‘asking what one already knows’, ‘raising the voice’, ‘sitting in gatherings’, ‘kneeling before imam or scholar’. These last three were grouped, with others, under the subentry ‘etiquette’. First-level subentries included ‘answering’, ‘asking’, and ‘asking and answering’.

As I continued indexing Volume 1, I became familiar with this pattern and structured the subentries in a similar way as I went, editing in the midst of a book as new topics came up.

#### Other entries

The text often contained material for other entries as well. For example, in the Book of Knowledge, one of the chapters headed ‘raising the voice’ described an incident in which the Companions were not making their ablutions for prayer correctly and the Prophet raised his voice to correct them. I also indexed this under ‘ablution (_wuduʾ_)’ – which is a book in a later volume – with the subentry ‘wiping over feet’, the action for which the Companions were corrected.

In another example, a hadith relates that while the Prophet was sitting with his Companions in the mosque, a Bedouin entered with his camel and tied its leg, then approached the Prophet and asked him questions. It should be noted that the mosque at that time was basically a walled courtyard with a dirt floor and with only part of it roofed. The commentary includes an inference of one scholar that camel urine and dung are pure because the Prophet did not complain to the man about tying his camel there. The commentary also includes other versions of the hadith that indicate that the camel was tied outside the mosque, not in it. Nevertheless, that paragraph led to the following index entries in addition to the one under ‘knowledge’ and others:

> Bedouins
> 
> camels
> 
> urine and dung of
> 
> mosques
> 
> cleanliness of
> 
> camel inside mosque
> 
> purity/impurity
> 
> of camel urine and dung

#### Granularity

In my mind nearly everything in hadith is important, and I did have some problems in picking up too much. For example, at the end of most chapters there is a list of minor lessons that could also be learned from the hadith. I realized I had to either pick them all up or ignore them all. It took me some time to accept that I had to cut back and ignore them all unless there were three to four lines of text. This was especially true in grammar, discussed in the next section.

#### Grammar and rhetoric

Before starting on the project, I had a video call with the publisher. Among other things he gave his rationale for including the sections on grammar in the translation, and I am glad that these sections were retained. For someone like me, who knows a little Arabic, these sections are useful, and I found a few discussions of grammar that were vital. For example, one chapter discussed a heresy that arose because the grammar – and therefore the meaning – of one sentence was misunderstood.

Because I enjoy grammar, I tended to pick up almost all of these mentions, even when there was minimal discussion, sometimes only pointing out the case of a noun or the mood of a verb. During the editing stage, I reviewed every one of these and omitted nearly half, retaining only those that had a minimum of three to four lines of text. That minimum became my rule in later indexing.

In addition to granularity, subentries were sometimes difficult. Usually I made the subentry a part of speech (adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions, particles, etc.), a sentence type (conditionals, imperatives, etc.), a function (emphasis, exaggeration, exception), or a rhetorical device (metaphor, rhetorical parallelism, totality, and restriction). Sub-subentries were then clarifications or particular cases. Sometimes the discussion did not lend itself to such a division, and I used an Arabic phrase or term as a subentry.

### Term selection

The translator often introduced an Arabic term, but then used the English term in almost all cases. I therefore used the English term with the gloss of the Arabic for the entry word, but I also made many entries of Arabic terms that are commonly used by Muslims, with s_ee_ cross-references to the English term. These included the types of ritual purification – _wuduʾ_ (ablution), _ghusl_ (bathing), _tayammum_ (dry ablution), _duʿaʾ_ (supplications, in contrast to ritual prayers), and some events in the Prophet’s life such as the _Miʿraj_ (Ascension). For this last item, the text did not include the Arabic term, but I know that Muslims often use the Arabic. In addition to _ghusl_ I had an entry at ‘purificatory bath’ with a _see_ cross-reference to ‘bathing (_ghusl_)’ because that term was used at one point in the text. I also had an entry for ‘impurity, major state of (_janaba_)’. This last is perhaps not the most elegantly worded entry, but it was the only way to put the keyword ‘impurity’ to the front. The concept of _janaba_ and cleansing from it is of major importance to the prayers, and _janaba_ was given an entry with a s_ee_ cross-reference.

I decided to put entries for the many different obligatory and optional prayers in inverted form so that they would come together and the reader would not have to flip back and forth through the index. Only the first entry had all of the _see also_ cross-references to the other prayers, as well as a few other entries. Some of the specific prayers also had _see also_ cross-references to related subjects, such as ‘Ramadan’ for the _tarawih_ prayer, which is an optional prayer performed only in Ramadan. As the cumulative index grows, I may decide to add more s_ee also_ cross-references to these.

For Volume 1, these main entries for the different prayers could have been edited to be subentries under ‘prayer’. However, I chose to keep the structure of the cumulative index here, believing that it might make it easier for the reader to find those entries in other single volumes if they follow the same structure. Some of the cross-references, such as ‘menstruation’, might appear odd to someone unfamiliar with Islamic concepts of prayer and purity, but these are related topics. I expect to add other main entries for the names of the five daily prayers as they appear in later volumes.

Early on I had put a main entry ‘prayer (_du_ʿ_a_ʾ)’ for supplications, which are different from the ritual prayer called _salah_. When it became apparent that ‘prayer (_salah_)’ was going to be very large and need separate main entries for each prayer, I changed the wording to ‘supplications (_du_ʿ_a_ʾ)’, with an entry and _see_ cross-reference at _du_ʿ_a_ʾ because Muslims often use the Arabic term.

I sometimes chose terms based on what would follow in a later volume. For example, I originally had an entry called ‘etiquette’ but I changed it to ‘good conduct’ because there is a Book of Good Conduct coming up later. I did keep ‘etiquette’ as a subentry, and I left ‘etiquette’ as a main entry with a _see_ cross-reference to ‘good conduct’. Sometimes I consulted the published translation of al-Bukhari to see whether it used a different term than the one used in this translation, and I would then make an entry for that term with a _see_ cross-reference to the term used in the translation of _Fath al-Bari_.

## Method

Before starting on this project, I checked the archives of _The Indexer_ for anything about indexing religious texts or multi-volume texts. I found most interesting the articles on indexing encyclopedias, but all of them were written before personal computers and indexing software existed. They had some relevant information on choosing what to index, but nothing that was directly relevant to this situation. And I found nothing about indexing Islamic religious texts.

I also asked for advice on indexing multi-volume works on indexing forums. One important piece of advice was that at about 25,000 records, Sky would start to have problems and I would need to split the indexes alphabetically across several files. I expect that will be necessary for the Names Index after Volume 3 is completed.

### Multiple indexes simultaneously

Creating four indexes at once seemed at first to run counter to the way my brain works. I wanted to just skim the pages for the three special indexes that did not require much thinking, and I thought that this would be a good way acquaint myself with the material. For the introductory materials – approximately 75 pages – I did each index separately, going through each chapter (usually only three or four pages) four times, picking out names, places, and works, and closing the relevant index file after each. I wrote the General Index last. This was obviously much too slow and I had to find a way not only to pick up speed, but also to write the four indexes at once.

When I started on the actual text of the commentary, I also had to become familiar with the organization and formatting conventions of each chapter (see [Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.17#F1)). A chapter typically begins with a transmission chain that uses en dashes (–) instead of translating the Arabic for ‘from’ or ‘on the authority of’. Thus the first name in the chain is the person that al-Bukhari heard the hadith from, and the last person is the first one to narrate it. The chain is followed by the text of the hadith in Arabic, the translation, and then the commentary.

In this some text is underlined, and it took me a while to understand that this typographical convention shows the quoted text that is being commented on. The names in the transmission chain are usually shortened forms, and the full forms are given a little later, often on the first page of the commentary, but sometimes farther down. I copied the names as given in the chain and then went back to complete the names as they were revealed.

In order to write the four indexes at once, I used as main entries the names of the special indexes – places, names, works – and copied the terms that would become main entries into the subentry field. After I had completed several chapters, I opened the corresponding index, and then in the General Index I grouped on the text of the main entry, selected all these records, and copied them into the special index. In that index I then grouped on the term in order to isolate these new records from the rest. I usually found that some of the characters with diacritics had not copied correctly from the General Index to the special index, although they had copied correctly from the PDF to the General Index. I had to scroll through all the new entries and correct those. Only when those were fixed did I select the group, swap the main entries with the subentries, and then delete all the subentries (places, names, works). When I was sure that the special index was correct, I deleted those entries from the General Index. There were so many names to pick up that I copied into the Names Index after only a few chapters because I did not want to copy more than a few hundred at a time.

When I started working on Volume 2, I found that I had to make one change in the Names and Places indexes. Those had only one level of subentry, but I realized that I had to add a level so that I could copy the records from the General Index without losing the sub-subentries.

In the General Index, I had entered the records for the Names Index in Sky like this, where 01 before _**volume**_ is hidden text to force the sorting<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.17#fn6" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn6">6</a></sup>:

<table><tbody><tr data-xml-align="left"><td>Names</td><td>Abu Hurayra</td><td>01<i><b>volume</b></i></td><td>1:3:14:375</td></tr></tbody></table>

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.17#tabular-1)

If I kept the Names Index with only one level of subentry, this would be the result of copying:

<table><tbody><tr data-xml-align="left"><td>Names</td><td>Abu Hurayra</td><td>1:3:14:375</td></tr></tbody></table>

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.17#tabular-2)

Once I had made a second level of subentry in the Names and Places indexes, I could select all and swap the main and first subentry levels. Then I repeated that to swap the first and second subentry levels. The sub-subentry level was then ‘names’ or ‘places’, and I could select the column and delete those.

### From cumulative to single-volume index

I wrote a cumulative index from the start. This meant that in the General Index, I had to put a subentry for everything. A topic might appear only once or twice in the current volume, but there was no way of knowing how many times it might appear in other volumes. I named all of these files Master: Master General, Master Names, Master Places, Master Works.

After I had completely finished editing the Master General Index, I saved the file with a new name, 01 General one, and then I had to edit it again. First I removed the volume number from the locators and adjusted the settings in Sky so that it would recognize the remaining parts of the locator – book, chapter, page number. Then I went through the whole index again and removed unnecessary subentries. If there was only one subentry, I sometimes combined it with the main entry so that it would make more sense. Most of the subentries were retained, even if there were only a few with one locator each, because I wanted to differentiate the various aspects of the entry.

It is likely to be slightly more difficult to make the subsequent individual volume indexes. If there were only volumes and not also books and chapters, I could select by volume, color code those entries and then filter out the remaining entries. But as the locators are now, I would have to search for a range for each chapter within a book. Book 4 has 75 chapters, so this step would need to be repeated 75 times for that book alone.

I plan to save the cumulative index with a new name, put it into page order, and then select and color-code (label) all the entries in the volume I am working on. I will then filter those labeled entries out of view, delete the remaining ones, and then filter the labeled entries to be viewed again. For the General Index, this will be approximately 2,000 records per volume; for the Names Index, 6,000 records per volume. I do not believe there is a quick and easy way to do this, and once the Names Index is too big and must be split across multiple indexes, it will be more difficult.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.17#fn7" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn7">7</a></sup>

For the General Index, one difficulty I foresee is the possible need to delete some of the cross-references in a given volume. It might be that a see also cross-reference could point to something that is only in another volume, not the one at hand. I have not thought of any way to make this easier, but I will have to use the error check in Sky.

### Need for speed

I admit that I am a slow indexer, but this project required me to pick up speed by forming some new habits and learning to use features that previously I either had no use for or had ignored, such as Promote, Demote, Combine, Shift Left, and Shift Right to deal with editing main entries, subentries, and sub-subentries. I also learned to use the mouse less and instead used Alt + Tab to move back and forth between Sky and my PDF.

### Split function

I had not had a use for this feature in previous work, but I used it a lot here for the Names Index. The Split function allows one to copy a list of names and then split them into separate records with a simple keystroke combination. In the introductory materials, which contained long lists of names separated by commas, I used the default comma as the split separator. In the commentary, I changed the separator to the en dash and space that was used in the transmission chains.

I also used the Split function to pick up names and works that occurred in the same line or two but with intervening text. This saved my hand from going back and forth between the text and the index, and my eyes from going back and forth between screens. For example, to pick up the three names in this line, I would make a main entry ‘names’ and copy this whole line into the subentry field:

> Muslim gives this hadith via the narration of al-Zuhrī on the authority of ʿUrwa

I would then put the cursor before ‘ʿUrwa’ and split (Ctrl + Alt + P); use Ctrl + Backspace to delete ‘on the authority of’; use Ctrl + arrow to put the cursor before ‘al-Zuhrī’ and split; then use Ctrl + Backspace to delete ‘gives this hadith via the narration of’. This would give me three name records with Muslim, al-Zuhrī, and ʿUrwa as the subentries.

### Trust in Find and Replace

In Arabic names and terms, the definite article _al-_ is to be ignored, and also the words _ibn_ (son of) and _bint_ (daughter of) when they come between names. In past projects I usually selected the definite article and changed it to ignored text after inputting each name. But in this index, there were so many names that I could not do that. Instead, when I was ready to copy records from the General Index into one of the special indexes, I first used Find and Replace to find all cases of ‘Al-’ (when a copied name had been at the beginning of a sentence) and change it to ‘al-’; then I found all cases of ‘al-’ and changed them to ignored text. For _ibn_ and _bint_, I also had to instruct Sky to match the case because _Ibn_ and _Bint_ at the beginning of names are not ignored.

## Looking ahead

As noted above, colleagues in indexing forums have advised me that when the indexes approach 25,000 records, I will have to split them into alphabet groups. For the Names index, I will likely split it after Volume 3, by which time I estimate that I will have 18,000 to 20,000 records. There are so many names beginning with Abu or ʿAbd that the letter A will have an index of its own.

As of writing this in late January 2021, the project is a month behind where it should be. After I finished Volume 1, the publisher asked me to index a short book before going on to Volume 2, and after that there were some other production delays. I am now nearing the halfway mark of Volume 2, and Volume 3 is waiting for me.

I have often seen _Fath al-Bari_ cited in works that I read or edited, and I am delighted that it is at last being translated to English and that I have been chosen to index it. I hope and pray that this monumental project will be completed in the coming years.
