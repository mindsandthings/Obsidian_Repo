Gale P. Rhoades, the North American publisher and distributor of the Macrex indexing program, passed away in California on 31 January 2021 after a brief illness. Gale had met many in the indexing community while attending indexing conferences and workshops in the United States of America, Canada, and the United Kingdom over the years.

Gale was born in Laramie, Wyoming, a city known for its ‘gale’-force winds, in 1948. Her early years included ranch life in Wyoming, San Francisco Bay Area high school and assisting her father with his college genetics teaching and lab work, and a year in Malawi, where her father taught biology, and she reveled in animals and volunteered in a hospital.

During her years in San Francisco, starting in the late 1960s, Gale became the manager of jewelry shops in the Hilton Hotel chain. At the Hilton she met her husband, Lloyd D. Rhoades. They were happily married for 32 years until Lloyd’s death in 2009. All of these experiences contributed to her vast store of knowledge and curiosity about practically everything, always offered freely to her friends and clients.

In 1981 Gale acquired an Osborne 1 microcomputer. This was the first commercially successful portable personal computer, weighing 25 pounds (11.3 kg). It could fit under an airplane seat at the time. The screen was small, five inches (12.7 cm). The Osborne 1 was a CP/M computer, with included bundled software, and could be run by plugging it into a regular wall socket. Unfortunately the documentation was not great. In the beginning users had to figure out for themselves how to use the computer and software. This is where Gale shined as she helped others learn to use their computers as the First Osborne Group (FOG) was formed. Later FOG developed into FOG International with Gale at the helm as executive director, with nearly 40,000 members in 43 countries. One day in the late 1980s Nancy Mulvany, at the time the North American distributor for Macrex, walked into Gale’s office with an eight-inch floppy disk asking for help. She needed to get Macrex onto the eight-inch disk and configure it properly for the computer with the eight-inch drive. That visit began a collaboration and deep friendship that led to Gale taking over in 1993 as the North American publisher and distributor of the Macrex indexing program developed by Hilary and Drusilla Calvert in England. Gale provided technical support and worked closely with the Calverts to develop new versions of the program over the years. In addition to her Macrex duties Gale also ran a successful consulting business in the San Francisco Bay Area. Her clients included sole proprietorships, tech firms, trucking companies, and police departments.

Eventually Gale relocated out of the immediate Bay Area to a town east of Sacramento where she continued her Macrex support duties. She was able to participate in a student exchange program with the University of California Davis Extension (Intensive English Programs). She hosted many young men (two or three at a time), mostly from Japan, some for a few weeks, others for close to a year. She loved their curiosity and helped them improve their English language skills. Gale also taught computer skills at the Woodland Adult Education program. Most students were older adults and others who were having problems with their computers. Gale taught any computer skill requested by the students. Her students were very fond of her patience and kindness. Gale also joined her new community in the County District Attorney’s innovative Neighborhood Court (NHC) program. Community volunteers like Gale have made this adult criminal diversion program very successful, using principles of restorative justice to resolve offenses, outside of the traditional justice system. Gale Rhoades will be missed by many communities far and wide.

This remembrance is a collaboration between Nancy Mulvany, Do Mi Stauber, and the Pinney family.
