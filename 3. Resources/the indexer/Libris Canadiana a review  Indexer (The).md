## Abstract

A review of _Libris Canadiana_ explains that it not only serves as an example of controlled vocabulary development through its thesaurus, but also enables researchers to easily access the vast amount of archival material buried in many volumes covering diverse areas of Canadian history. An outline of the user experience is illustrated with screenshots demonstrating the user-friendliness and functionality of the Web interface.

You’ve found an archival gem when you discover the _Libris Canadiana_ website. This one-stop website presents an impressive collection of indexes for a selected group of historical Canadian periodicals.

Its creators decided in 2003 to combine the indexes of some prominent Canadian magazines into an online format. Launched in 2005, this comprehensive collection of indexes is rich in the depiction of the political, social, cultural and economic history of Canada from roughly 1867 to 2014. Gord Ripley of Reference Press created and maintains the website and the principal indexer is Gordon Adshead.

Their mandate is to provide indexes for periodicals of historical significance, adding that their aim is to add and enhance the content going forward. What is particularly useful is the ability to link to full-text retrieval of one’s search results for selected periodicals:

> **_Libris Canadiana_ is an index, not a full-text database**. However, The Internet Archive has digitized early issues (1909–1923) of The Canadian Bookman, and we have utilized this excellent resource to provide full-text date-specific access via a link in relevant citations. In 2018, full-text links will also be added for digitized volumes of The Monetary Times … Libraries and institutions running OpenURL translators can link directly to full text (where available) from the citation display screen. Please contact Reference Press to establish an OpenURL connection. \[emphasis added\]

Using Fraser Sutherland’s ([1989](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.5#core-R1)) _The monthly epic: a history of Canadian magazines_ was a wise resource choice for the creators – the book gives an in-depth analysis of the development of Canadian periodicals from pre-Confederation to recent times.

The periodicals listed in Sources are examples of the most impressively documented records of Canadian life over the past 100+ years. Users should refer to the descriptions here before beginning their search to guide them towards the best source material for their particular search.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.5#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup>

One’s subscription allows one access to index compilations of _The Canadian Bookman_, _The Canadian Forum_, _The Canadian Magazine_, _Descant_, _Everywoman’s World_, _The Financial Post_, _Maclean’s Magazine_, _Massey’s Magazine_, _The Monetary Times of Canada_, _Saturday Night_ and _The University Magazine_, with _Maclean’s Magazine_ described as the centrepiece of the website.

While the content is broad and comprehensive, my particular wish list might also include historical titles from _Chatelaine_, _Harrowsmith_ or _Tamarack Review_. Maybe it’s on their wish list too. One can only do so much!

The subscription rates are reasonable: $50Cdn a year for individuals, $60–$100Cdn for libraries, and $175–$350Cdn for colleges and universities (the rate is based on enrollment). Universities and their students are the primary users of the content.

## Website display

There is nothing more pleasant for a reader than to enter a website with its focus on clarity. The eye need not absorb any extraneous information. The changing historical images and colours are muted, allowing the content to take precedence over display style. These are nice touches with images of notable Canadians: poets Bliss Carman and Pauline Johnson (contributors to _Massey’s Magazine_), and former prime minister Arthur Meighen. Additionally, in the background of the website banner are two changing historical photographs, one of a waterfront city skyline and the other of a downtown city street with streetcar tracks (see [Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.5#F1)). Might it be Toronto’s King Street?

_Libris Canadiana_ offers six entry choices on its website:

•

_About_ details the subscriber rates and terms of use.

•

_Sources_ contains a concise list with descriptions of the periodicals contained in their database, including their annotated indexes.

•

_Main_ offers a quick description of the database and the names of the indexers.

•

_Search_ is self-explanatory and is the heart of the website (see below).

•

_Help_ is what it says. It gives the reader clear instructions on how to find the right information, easily. It also offers a good explanation of the Boolean logic search strategy which is also repeated in Search under the Guidelines for searching.

•

_News_ is the final choice; however, there has been no news advertised since December 2017. I suspect there may be news to add since that date.

A little further information on the Help section ([Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.5#F2)): a Boolean search strategy is a helpful search tool: its two primary tools are to add search operators and/or a truncation symbol (\*) to obtain results for all forms of a root word. _Libris Canadiana_ has wisely included easily understandable Boolean search instructions:

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2021.5/asset/3821bb01-755e-4412-8aec-0c6310a4751e/assets/graphic/indexer_2021_5_fig2.jpg)

Figure 2. The Help section on Libris Canadiana

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.5#F2)

> The Boolean operators AND, OR and NOT can (optionally) be used to define complex queries. For example, fish AND salmon will list all records containing both of these terms, while fish NOT salmon will list all records containing fish except those also containing salmon. fish OR salmon will list records containing either term.
> 
> The All Fields truncation symbol (\* or $) is used as follows: fish\* will list all records containing words starting with the root fish, e.g. fishermen, fishing, fishmonger, etc.

It’s definitely worth reading through the Help section before venturing to Search ([Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.5#F3)).

## Search: the heart of the website

As this is content of historical Canadian significance, a search for momentous events in Canadian history during the past 100 years has been conducted for this review. Searches were performed for residential schools, the Spanish flu and women’s suffrage (suffrag\*).

‘Residential schools’ resulted in twenty results displayed in chronological order ([Figure 4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.5#F4)). Although it is not specifically explained in Help, it is intuitive to click on any number of titles to _save_ the initial results. You are then given the opportunity to _export_ your results and then the choice to sort, email or print your results ([Figure 5](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.5#F5)).

While the initial results only show title, source, and date, the exported saved results are displayed in full format, including topic(s), author, indexer notes, and issue of publication, including page range. An image of the cover page completes it.

It is important to highlight that the _Libris Canadiana_ indexers have put great effort into writing concise and descriptive notes (abstracts) for articles, showing their keen knowledge of the source material. The reader will appreciate it!

The ‘Spanish flu’ search only offered three results ([Figures 6](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.5#F6) and [7](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.5#F7)). However, the variant form of ‘influenza epidemic’ offered more titles ([Figures 8](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.5#F8) and [9](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.5#F9)).

Incidentally, when the user clicks on topic headings, they will be directed to the thesaurus. Here one will be able to grasp the expansiveness of the breadth and depth of this controlled vocabulary. Topic headings are additionally listed with the number of occurrences or hits in the database.

‘Women’s suffrage’ additionally was searched for historical interest, producing good results using the same save and export results process ([Figure 10](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.5#F10)), but something curious happened with this search. While the topic ‘influenza’ would bring one to ‘influenza’ in the thesaurus, this was not the case for ‘Women–Suffrage’. Clicking on that topic did not bring me to that specific term in the thesaurus but instead to terms of various styles under women. While it does not detract from the search results, it does highlight the formatting differences between the amalgamated indexes.

## No results?

How often have you encountered an unsuccessful search? Many websites will simply give a curt ‘no results found’ notification. _Libris Canadiana_ gives you a courteous response and provides some alternative suggestions for your search strategy ([Figure 11](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.5#F11)).

## In conclusion …

Overall, _Libris Canadiana_ is a useful resource for indexers and editors alike. The thesaurus itself is a good study in controlled vocabulary development. Being able to easily access the vast amount of archival material buried in all these volumes is a testament to the diligence of the indexers involved. Consider _Libris Canadiana_ a gateway into a rich depository of diverse areas of Canadian history. Enjoy and learn!
