## Abstract

This paper investigates how the level of information made available to the book indexer about a potential job can affect their quote. Participants of the ‘Quoting on Projects’ session at the Indexing Society of Canada/Société canadienne d’indexation 2021 conference were asked to complete a short survey prior to the conference investigating eight quoting scenarios based on a specific book. The survey results informed this paper. Additional topics covered indexer attributes, quoting methods and establishing a realistic fee for the specific indexing job.

Being asked to provide a quote to index a book is stressful, regardless of your level of indexing experience. You do not want to overquote because you reduce the chances of getting the job. At the same time, you do not want to underquote, as the client may expect you to work at the same low hourly, page or word rate for future jobs, and having to increase rates for subsequent jobs may not be acceptable to the client. Ideally, a quote should sit somewhere in the middle. While you can charge what you consider reasonable, the quote must be acceptable to you and your client. Indexers must remember that they are professionals and should expect reasonable remuneration for their indexing skill and expertise.

## Survey methodology

Quoting for book indexing has been the subject of several previous papers: for example, [Weaver (2009)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.5#core-R6), [Gillen (2020)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.5#core-R3) and [Davis (2021)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.5#core-R1) all looked at factors affecting the quote, as well as quoting methods across a range of texts more generally. [McMaster (2012)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.5#core-R5) followed in a similar vein but provided an example based on a single title. This paper extends that earlier work by focusing on how the level of information made available to the indexer about a potential job can affect their quote. The survey methodology was chosen to capture a diverse range of opinions from book indexers from a number of countries through a uniform series of questions. All respondents were registrants at the Indexing Society of Canada/Société canadienne d’indexation (ISC/SCI) 2021 conference and had different levels of indexing experience.

Participants in the conference session were asked to complete a short survey prior to the conference on eight quoting scenarios based on a specific title. The eight scenarios chosen represented the types of situations that indexers encounter when working with a potential client. They ranged from minimal information to full text availability and situations where there were varying degrees of constraints.

Having all participants quote on the same title made analysis and comparison much easier. The title chosen – _Travel North America (and avoid being a tourist)_, published by Hardie Grant – was recent (published in May 2021), covered travel – a topic that most people are interested in – and focused mainly on Canada and the USA, so the content would be familiar to most conference participants. The other important factor was that I had compiled the index, so was familiar with the text.

The survey received 28 responses.

At the beginning of the survey, there were two general questions.

### General question 1: in which country do you reside?

As [Table 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.5#T1) shows, most participants came from Canada and the USA, with a smaller number from the UK and (continental) Europe. One person came from Egypt.

Table 1. Location of survey respondents

| Country | No. of indexers |
| --- | --- |
| Canada | 12 |
| USA | 10 |
| UK | 2 |
| Egypt | 1 |
| Europe | 3 |
| Total | 28 |

### General question 2: level of indexing experience

Quoting is challenging and often overwhelming for very new indexers/student indexers; however, there were only four responses in this category (see [Table 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.5#T2)).

Table 2. Level of indexing experience among survey respondents

| Level of experience | No. | Per cent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Experienced indexers (more than 20 indexes created) | 19 | 68 |
| Early-career indexers (5 to 20 indexes created) | 5 | 18 |
| Very new indexers/student indexers (fewer than 5 indexes created) | 4 | 14 |

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.5#T2)

The small number probably reflects the fact that it is more experienced indexers who usually attend conferences and that newer/student indexers do not feel able to respond to a survey on quoting.

To simplify the analysis of responses and make direct comparisons easier, Canadian dollars and US dollars were assumed to be equal; pounds sterling were converted to Canadian dollars at prevailing exchange rates.

## The eight quoting scenarios

### Scenario 1: initial quote

You receive an email from an editor at a commercial publisher you have not worked with before and are asked to provide a quote for a new book.

> Can you please provide a quote to index an upcoming travel title for our company:
> 
> _Travel North America (and avoid being a tourist)._
> 
> Extent: 275 pages/60,000 words.
> 
> Turnaround time: 10 business days.

Would you seek further particulars from the editor before quoting?

•

If Yes, what would you ask?

•

If No, what would you quote?

#### Initial quote results

Yes – 20 (71 per cent)

No – 8 (29 per cent)

Evaluation of the 20 ‘Yes’ responses revealed a range of requests for additional information:

•

requests for sample pages/chapters (the most common request)

•

number of indexable pages

•

embedded index or straight back-of-book index

•

do images need to be indexed?

•

does the publisher have a specific indexing style?

These were sensible requests that would help the indexer provide a more accurate quote. The eight other respondents all provided quotes for the job. Their quotes were analysed as follows.

> Range: $650–$1,600
> 
> Page rates: $3.50–$5.50 per page (i.e. $950–$1,500)<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.5#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup>
> 
> Mean: $1,025

Although there was considerable variation in the results, most quotes were in the $950 to $1,500 range.

Five of the responses were from experienced indexers. Obviously, these participants based their quotes on their knowledge and experience of indexing similar titles. It is likely that the three other responses, all from less experienced indexers, were rough estimates.

Quoting on texts sight-unseen is generally fine when you are confident that the type of material you are receiving falls within your comfort zone. However, it is still possible to get your fingers badly burnt, as illustrated in [Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.5#F1). The moral here – be very sure what you are going to receive when quoting blind!

### Scenario 2: blurb

> Publication title: _Travel North America (and avoid being a tourist)._
> 
> Extent: 275 pages/60,000 words.
> 
> Turnaround time: 10 business days.
> 
> Maximum index length: 9 letter/A4 pages (two-columned).

The basic book details are virtually the same as in Scenario 1; however, a specification on the length of index required has been added. In addition, the editor provided the following blurb about the book:

> Following the success of their first book _Travel Anywhere_, Fathom’s latest book _Travel North America_ pays homage to the stories, histories, landscapes and cultures of the vast and diverse North American continent.
> 
> The future of travel is set to keep us closer to home, encourage us to slow down, expand our minds and bring us closer to nature. Tapping into a treasure trove of time-tested recommendations (both classic and little known) and a network of interesting people (chefs, novelists, designers, innkeepers, musicians), Fathom’s founders Jeralyn Gerba and Pavia Rosati provide inspiration and practical trip-planning advice for modern travellers looking to rediscover North America in the wake of the coronavirus. With a focus on the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean, _Travel North America_ includes chapters such as ‘Brave New World – The post-pandemic travel mindset’, ‘Follow Nature’s Lead’, ‘Second Cities Take First Place’, ‘Road Tripping’ and ‘Giving Back – Humanitarian travel in North America’.
> 
> Presented in a beautifully designed package, _Travel North America_ will show you that now has never been a better time to plan your next vacation, not too far from home.

What is your quote?

#### Blurb results

> Range: $650–$2000
> 
> Page rates: $3.00–$4.50 per page (i.e. $825–$1,250)
> 
> Most respondents quoted around $1,100 ($4.00 per page)
> 
> Mean: $1,140

The quotes in this scenario are higher than those in Scenario 1, but making meaningful comparisons between the two scenarios was difficult because of the small number of participants who provided an initial quote.

While knowing the length of index required is useful, particular attention should be given to the blurb, which answers many of the questions raised in Scenario 1. For instance, the blurb indicates that the text is rich with images (it is ‘a beautifully designed package’) which may or may not need indexing. However, in most travel books, the images are purely cosmetic or decorative and intended to whet the reader’s appetite, to give them an inkling of what they might see or experience at a given destination: for example, a picture of a waterfall, a snow-covered chalet or a dining area at a restaurant. While we cannot infer the number of images from the blurb, we can assume that their number will be substantial, meaning that the images are likely to comprise at least 10 to 15 per cent of the text, maybe more. In essence, given the text is a travel title, the images can largely be ignored. The blurb also indicates that the text will be relatively simple and not filled with jargon.

What other information does the blurb provide? It indicates the audience for the book – modern travellers. Knowing the audience is fundamental for every indexing job. If the indexer does not understand whom they are indexing for, it is impossible to create a useful index. Although publishers might dream of their titles being suitable for everyone from a three-year-old to a post-doctoral fellow, the indexer can only choose one audience and tailor the index for them.

The blurb also indicates that the book will include travel destinations – towns, regions, scenic areas, cuisines, accommodation, activities and interesting people, so there is likely to be a substantial number of entries required.

This is all useful information for preparing a quote.

### Scenario 3: chapter only provided

> Publication title: _Travel North America (and avoid being a tourist)._
> 
> Extent: 275 pages/60,000 words.
> 
> Turnaround time: 10 business days.
> 
> Maximum index length: 9 letter/A4 pages (two-columned).
> 
> One indicative chapter of text supplied as a PDF.

In this scenario the specifications are the same as before, although the editor has also supplied an indicative chapter as a PDF.

What is your quote?

#### Chapter-only results

> Range: $650–$2,000
> 
> Page rates: $3.00–$4.50 per page (i.e. $825–$1250)
> 
> Mean: $1,060

Having access to a chapter of the text has tightened the quotes compared to those in Scenario 2 (blurb). Although the range of quotes and page rates are the same in both scenarios, the mean has decreased by $80 from $1,140 to $1,060, which is a significant change (a reduction of 7 per cent).

### Scenario 4: full text provided

> Publication title: _Travel North America (and avoid being a tourist)._
> 
> Extent: 275 pages/60,000 words.
> 
> Turnaround time: 10 business days.
> 
> Maximum index length: 9 letter/A4 pages (two-columned).
> 
> Full text supplied as a PDF.

In this scenario, participants were provided with the full text as a PDF, rather than just a chapter. All other specifications remained the same.

What is your quote?

#### Full-text results

> Range: $650–$2000
> 
> Page rates: $4.00–$4.50 per page (i.e. $1,100–$1,250)
> 
> Mean: $1,070

Having access to the full text of the work compared to the indicative chapter supplied in Scenario 3 only resulted in a slightly higher mean quote of $1,070 with the full text versus $1,060 with the single chapter, although page rates were in a narrower range in this scenario.

Interestingly, several participants calculated the precise number of indexable pages before providing their quote, rather than relying on the 275-page extent specified by the editor.

One participant, having seen the full text, was concerned about the amount of space available for the index and charged a slightly higher page rate in case they needed to be selective. This was sensible, as it takes longer to select the most appropriate entries instead of simply adding everything possible to the index. Although this is sometimes a difficult concept for editors or authors to understand, a shorter index often costs more, since indexers need to spend longer deciding what information to include and what to omit.

### Scenario 5: fixed budget of $350

> Publication title: _Travel North America (and avoid being a tourist)._
> 
> Extent: 275 pages/60,000 words.
> 
> Turnaround time: 10 business days.
> 
> Maximum index length: 9 letter/A4 pages (two-columned).
> 
> Full text supplied as a PDF.
> 
> Fixed budget for indexing: $350.

The specifications are the same as in Scenario 4, but a very limited fixed budget has been imposed.

Do you take the job?

•

Yes, but do a shorter/less detailed index

#### Fixed-budget results

The results for the fixed-budget scenario are shown in [Table 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.5#T3). Perhaps unsurprisingly, most of the experienced indexers (84 per cent) said they would decline to take the job on. Conversely, six of the very new or early-career indexers (67 per cent) indicated they would take the job, with almost all choosing to compile a shorter or less detailed index. A likely explanation is that these newer indexers were motivated to gain a new client and/or gain indexing experience on a popular trade title, rather than worrying about the financial return.

Table 3. Summary of responses to the fixed-budget scenario

| Level of experience | No. |
| --- | --- |
| Early-career indexer (5 to 20 indexes created) | 5 |
| No | 2 |
| Yes, but do a shorter/less detailed index | 3 |
| Experienced indexer (more than 20 indexes created) | 19 |
| No | 16 |
| Yes | 1 |
| Yes, but do a shorter/less detailed index | 2 |
| Very new indexer/student indexer (fewer than 5 indexes created) | 4 |
| No | 1 |
| Yes | 1 |
| Yes, but do a shorter/less detailed index | 2 |
| Total | 28 |

Doing a less detailed index can be difficult, particularly in a title like this travel book. How do you decide which places or activities should be left out, when one destination or adventure is as important as the next? You are likely to spend more time just trying to make those decisions than if you indexed all of the entries in the first place.

### Scenario 6: generous budget

> Publication title: _Travel North America (and avoid being a tourist)._
> 
> Extent: 275 pages/60,000 words.
> 
> Turnaround time: 10 business days.
> 
> Maximum index length: 9 letter/A4 pages (two-columned).
> 
> Full text supplied as a PDF.
> 
> Budget for indexing: up to $2,000.

The specifications are the same as in Scenario 4 but with a generous budget on offer.

#### Generous-budget results

> Range: $650–$2,000
> 
> Page rates: $4.00–$6.00 per page (i.e. $1,100–$1,650)
> 
> Mean: $1,150

The generous budget in this scenario allowed most participants to charge slightly more than they quoted in Scenario 4. This is reflected in the page rates of $4.50 to $6.00, compared to $4.00 to $4.50 per page for the full text. The range of quotes, however, was the same in both scenarios. Only two participants quoted the maximum figure of $2,000, although one had done so in Scenario 4. Looking at the mean quote, the increase of $80 (7.5 per cent) from $1,070 (full text) to $1,150 (generous budget) was not large but is still significant.

It is apparent that most indexers added a small fudge factor to their actual estimated cost because of the generous budget on offer. Aside from the two participants who quoted the full amount, the remaining 26 were obviously more interested in gaining repeat business from the new client by charging a lower amount than the budget allowed, rather than being mercenary and charging the full amount. This is a sound commercial approach and one which will hold the indexer in good stead with the editor.

### Scenario 7: short turnaround

> Publication title: _Travel North America (and avoid being a tourist)._
> 
> Extent: 275 pages/60,000 words.
> 
> Turnaround time: 4 days.
> 
> Maximum index length: 9 letter/A4 pages (two-columned).
> 
> Full text supplied as a PDF.

You will receive the job on Thursday morning. The index must be returned to the editor by the following Monday morning (i.e. four days later). This means you may need to work over the weekend to get the index done. No time extensions possible. The specifications are the same as in Scenario 4 but contain a time constraint with potential to impact on the indexer’s weekend.

Do you take the job?

•

If Yes, what is your quote?

#### Short-turnaround results

> No – 14 (54%)
> 
> Yes – 12 (46%)

Two respondents did not answer this question.

The impact of potential time constraints influenced respondents’ answers. While 14 respondents declined to take the job, their reasons for doing so focused on the following themes:

•

insufficient time to do a good job

•

do not work over weekends

•

too stressful due to the short time frame

•

already booked and could not take the job on.

Conversely, 12 respondents indicated that they would accept the job and its time constraints. Of these respondents, eight were experienced indexers. One can only assume that they were not bothered by the short time frame and had the time and experience to take the job on. Three others were very new indexers who would presumably take the job to gain a new client, gain experience and add a title to their portfolio. Just one of the early-career indexers said they would take the job on.

> Range: $650–$3,000 (although the $3,000 was $1,000 higher than the next highest response)
> 
> Mean: $1,440 (excluding the $3,000 figure).

For some participants, neither the short turnaround nor the requirement to work over the weekend caused them to alter their quotes, yet others obviously factored in a higher charge because of the constraints. The increase of $370 (35 per cent) to the mean from the full-text quote in Scenario 4 ($1,070) was very significant. This increase equates to a change from around $4.00 per page to $5.25 per page and is warranted. If the client expects an indexer to work over the weekend and/or work for longer hours per day because of their short turnaround, there should be a financial penalty for doing so.

In saying that, if an indexer is given a reasonable amount of time to do a job but is forced to work over a weekend because of their poor time management, they obviously cannot charge the client any extra.

### Scenario 8: not-for-profit organisation

> Publication title: _Travel North America (and avoid being a tourist)._
> 
> Extent: 275 pages/60,000 words.
> 
> Turnaround time: 10 business days.
> 
> Maximum index length: 9 letter/A4 pages (two-columned).
> 
> Full text supplied as a PDF.

This final scenario assumed that the travel book was being produced by a not-for-profit organization rather than a commercial publisher and that most participants understood the concept of a not-for-profit organization.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.5#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> All other details remain the same as in Scenario 4.

#### Not-for-profit results

> Range: $500–$2000
> 
> Page rates: $2.50–$4.50 per page (i.e. $700–$1,250)
> 
> Mean: $1,020

Analysis of the quotes provided for this scenario revealed a broader range of figures than for the commercial publishing scenarios, with the lower end of the range decreasing, but the top end remaining the same. The mean decreased to $1,020 – a $50 drop compared to the full-text mean of $1,070. Interestingly, only a third of indexers offered a discount on their full quote provided in Scenario 4; the remainder charged their same rate. For those offering a reduction, the level of discount varied enormously, from a substantial 35 per cent reduction to a very modest three per cent.

The key consideration in this scenario is whether one should be charging a discounted commercial rate for not-for-profit organizations.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.5#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup> While it might ease one’s conscience to provide a discount to a charitable organization, the indexer still needs to pay their mortgage, pay gas and electricity bills and buy groceries. Mortgage lenders, utility companies and the supermarket will not give any discounts! Ultimately, the decision whether to provide a discount is an individual decision and not one in which a blanket ruling needs to be made.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.5#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup>

## Quote preparation

Two questions followed the scenarios to complete the survey.

### How did you prepare your quotes?

•

Indexed a sample of the text and extrapolated (2)

•

Estimated based on prior experience of indexing a similar title (25)

Almost all (around 90 per cent) of the respondents made an estimate based on experience. Two others indexed a sample of the text and extrapolated the time taken for the extent of the whole text, and one newer indexer indicated that they were unsure how to index a sample.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.5#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup>

Having established how many pages can be indexed in an hour, and therefore what page rate to charge in order to achieve their desired hourly rate, it is important that freelance indexers build in a certain amount extra to allow for editing and unforeseen complications. In any case, it is worth noting that in establishing their hourly rate, freelancers need to remember that the working hours for which they are reimbursed must cover the unpaid hours spent running their business (administration, marketing, etc.).

### Which rate did you use to prepare your quote?

•

Per page rate ($ per indexable page) – 19 (68%)

•

Word rate ($ per 1,000 words) – 6 (21%)

•

Hourly rate ($ per hour) – 1 (4%)

•

Mix of per page rate and hourly rate – 2 (7%)

Although most respondents said they used the page rate method, no particular method is better than another.

Whatever method is used, an estimated cost for the job is all that most editors or authors require following their initial enquiry to see whether an indexer is interested in a particular job. The estimate can be revised once an indicative chapter or full text has been provided. Having seen all or part of the text, it is then possible to ascertain whether more than one index is needed; whether there are extensive footnotes that might need indexing; or whether illustrations, graphs, tables or other material need to be included in the index.

One-fifth of respondents indicated that they used the word rate method, which is particularly useful when the size of the text is given in terms of the number of words; this is becoming the norm, particularly if the indexer is commissioned before the book has been typeset. How much the indexer wants to earn, and how much the publisher or author is prepared to pay, are major considerations in whether a quote is accepted. Although the word rate method can be applied to all texts, it may be more useful for scholarly works covering history, politics, law and other social sciences where there are often large blocks of text uninterrupted by graphs, tables and illustrations. [Gillen (2021)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.5#core-R4) provides an analysis of word rates and fees applied to monographs.

The hourly rate method has gone out of favour, although it was once widely used. Just one respondent indicated that they used the method, although another two said they used it in combination with the page rate. The hourly rate is most practical when a sample of text can be indexed to determine the number of pages that can be indexed in an hour. The Society of Indexers (SI), ANZSI and ISC/SCI publish recommended hourly rates, while SI also suggests page and word rates. The hourly rate recommended by SI, based on June 2021 data, was £26.15 (C$44.50), while ANZSI recommended AU$70 per hour (C$64.70). ISC/SCI’s recommended-rate figures are dated, but the top rate of C$65 per hour is comparable to the ANZSI rate. In saying that, it is difficult to claim that any one figure is high or low, since the cost of living and wage rates differ between countries. In addition to making recommendations, several indexing societies also run regular surveys to ascertain what members are actually earning from their indexing work. The biggest drawback of the hourly rate method becomes apparent when neither a sample chapter nor the full text are provided. In this situation, being able to look back at prior indexing records for similar kinds of texts is invaluable in establishing approximately how many pages can be indexed per hour. Keeping records of the types of books indexed, including their size, complexity and audience, and what the client was charged, is invaluable as a basis for providing future quotes.

As already noted, most editors and authors are not interested in the method used to derive the quote. They are really only interested in the bottom line – or in other words, how much the indexing is going to cost.

## Other considerations when quoting

When quoting for a job, it pays to consider more than just the text. Time, subject knowledge and interest are among other factors that will affect an indexer’s suitability for a particular job.

### Indexer attributes that can impact quotes

•

Familiarity with the subject and subject conventions. With technical or scholarly works, the greater one’s understanding of the subject, the faster the throughput

•

Familiarity with the publisher’s style

•

Familiarity with your indexing software

•

Time: being able to put in the time commitment to complete a satisfactory job is critical, and being realistic in what can be achieved in the time allowed while maintaining professional standards.

### Reasons not to provide a quote

•

Insufficient subject knowledge

•

Dislike of the author or subject. The topic may be controversial, and if an indexer’s views are diametrically opposed to the author’s, and they cannot treat the text dispassionately, they would be advised not to take the job

•

Problems with the editor or publishing house; see, as a case in point, the example mentioned earlier

•

Unclear text: a book so poorly written or edited that it is difficult to follow

•

Insufficient time to complete the job.

### Other factors that can affect a quote

•

Speed of turnaround required

•

Type of index: embedded or back-of-book

•

Whether large numbers of footnotes or endnotes need to be indexed

•

The number of indexes required: for example, legal texts – three indexes: subjects, cases and legislation; psychology texts – two indexes: subjects and cited authors; botany/zoology texts – two indexes: common names and scientific names

•

Whether information in tables needs to be indexed. (This is much more than just indexing captions. A biochemistry text can include the names of many plants, animals and microorganisms, that only appear in the tables. They all need to be indexed)

•

Whether illustrations and graphics need to be indexed.

## Calculating a realistic fee for _Travel North America_

Responses to the eight scenarios discussed above yielded a range of quotes. The mean quote for each scenario, plus the number of respondents, is given in [Table 4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.5#T4).

Table 4. Mean quotes for the eight scenarios

| Scenario | Mean quote (no. of responses) |
| --- | --- |
| Initial quote | $1,025 (8) |
| Blurb | $1,140 (28) |
| Chapter only | $1,060 (28) |

The factor that had the biggest impact was the short turnaround. In that scenario, rates increased by 35 per cent over the full-text mean quote, which is taken as the base figure. Even the offer of a generous budget only had a minor impact on the final mean quote, which was 7.5 per cent higher than the full-text mean. Taking all that into consideration and excluding the mean quotes for the fixed-budget and short-turnaround scenarios, the overall mean quote is $1,077, which is very close to the mean quote for the full-text scenario. This equates to around $4.00 per page. (Interestingly, I undercharged compared to the average, as I only charged the client AU$900 (C$830)).

Overall, the full-text mean quote of $1,070 is a realistic fee to charge for _Travel North America._

What these results show is that having access to either the full text or an indicative chapter is essential for preparing a quote, and this should be the norm.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.5#fn6" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn6">6</a></sup> Most indexers are not overly influenced by generous budgets or by whether an organization is a not-for-profit. They are, however, very much influenced by a low budget or a very short turnaround for a job.

This article is based on a presentation at the Indexing Society of Canada/Société canadienne d’indexation conference on 27 May 2021. Thank you to the 28 indexers who responded to the survey. Their input and responses were invaluable for this paper.

## Footnotes

1

Survey participants supplied their quotes in one of two formats, either as a total amount (which is reflected in the range provided) or as a page rate, which I converted to a total amount for ease of comparison. The range includes outliers, making it less accurate. No page rates were excluded, as there were no obvious outliers. Hence, the analysis favours converted page rates.

While many not-for-profits are charities, they can be sporting, religious, educational, social, well-being or scientific bodies. What distinguishes not-for-profits from other organizations is that they do not have a profit motive as their goal, and they reinvest all of their profits back into themselves to continue carrying out their mission. An example of a not-for-profit I did a job for recently is Ngala – a Western Australian organization whose aims are to support parents, families and communities to enhance the well-being and development of children and young people.

In the chat session following my 2021 ISC/SCI conference presentation there were a number of comments about not-for-profits that have very large budgets, e.g. Oxfam, and whether they should be entitled to a discount. To me the size of the not-for-profit’s budget is not a consideration. If you support the charitable work they do, that is the only criterion that matters.

Interestingly, a colleague of mine charges not-for-profit clients the full commercial rate but gives them a donation for what would be the discounted amount when submitting her invoice. The net result is the same, and such a donation may be tax deductible. Personally, I provide a slight discount for not-for-profit organizations.

It is a simple matter to index an indicative section of the text (15 pages, for example) and work out how long it will take to index the whole book.

Before the advent of PDFs and email, it was almost unheard of for an indexer to have sight of a text before agreeing to index it.
