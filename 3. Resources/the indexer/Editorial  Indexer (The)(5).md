Publication: The Indexer: The International Journal of Indexing

Volume 39, Number 1

I’m writing this at the end of 2020, which has been a challenging year for all of us living through the global COVID-19 pandemic. While the pandemic has brought much heartache, it has also changed our world in strange and wonderful ways. One thing that people have turned to for comfort is books. In the UK, people are reading more and have taken the opportunity to explore books that they didn’t normally have the time or desire to read or to reread familiar books for safety ([Boucher et al., 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.1#core-R2)). In this issue, Paula Clarke Bain touches on this experience of reading during a pandemic in her lovely review of _Piranesi_ by Susanna Clarke. What could be more comforting for indexers than to read a fantastical novel that incorporates an index as a plot device? I highly recommend it and Paula’s review, which will give you some great background and food for thought about the role books (and indexes) play in our lives.

Reading activity is also up in Australia, especially print books, and the publishing industry has been noting more positive than negative impacts from the pandemic ([Australian Publishers Association, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.1#core-R1)). And as Ann Kingdom noted in the last issue, freelance indexers have been faring well, with minimal changes to their working life and, in some cases, increased workflow ([Kingdom, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.1#core-R3)). They have also been writing about their craft, and I am delighted to bring you several articles in this issue from experienced indexing professionals. First up, Jan Wright and I wrap up our series on active ebook indexes. We hope that publishers and ebook app creators will take note of our findings. While we found many faults with how indexes are displayed in ebooks, we’re still excited by the possibilities for making them user-friendly and hope to bring you more about this in future. Gord Ripley and Gordon Adshead then take us on a tour of their online index database, _Libris Canadiana_, which provides access to a selection of Canadian periodicals. As Margaret de Boer notes in the review that follows, it’s an archival gem. Peter Rooney heroically created an index for the Mueller report, a highly anticipated US government document that sadly was published without an index. I am delighted to share his story with you in this issue. It’s a good reminder of the value of indexes for all complex publications, not just books. Ælfwine Mischler skilfully explains the complexities of indexing Arabic names, and Walter Greulich continues his series about how to create embedded indexes using Word. Walter has recently published this series as a book in German, which Pierke Bosschieter has kindly reviewed for us in this issue. Walter hopes to publish his book in English soon as well. In the meantime, I appreciate his willingness to share his expertise in the pages of _The Indexer_ and also to report on recent activities in the Deutsches Netzwerk der Indexer (DNI)/German Network of Indexers. Last but certainly not least is Pilar Wyman, co-chair of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) Criteria for Indexes Working Group, who gives us a report on the project to update indexing standards in the United States. As Pilar notes, it has been challenging to do this collaborative work during the pandemic. A salute to these indexers who are making such wonderful contributions to the profession during difficult times – thank you!

A late addition to this issue was an obituary for Douglas Matthews. Thank you to the SI members who quickly pulled together the lovely obituary which leads this issue. As they note, Douglas’s passing will leave a significant gap in the indexing profession. Whether or not you are familiar with Douglas and his work, I recommend reading about this ‘indexer extraordinaire’.
