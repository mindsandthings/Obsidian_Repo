## Abstract

When multiple indexers are working on the same material, it is not always possible to achieve the aim of consistency. This research project reports on an analysis of journal indexing by students in a graduate-level indexing course. The students’ use of derived and assigned subject terms was analyzed in order to determine patterns of inter-indexer consistency and link them to indexing theory. While this study was limited to the indexing of one article by non-professional indexers, the findings confirm that consistency is possible and suggest underlying reasons for inconsistency.

## Introduction

Indexing practices have evolved from ancient times until today, from indexing of library catalogs and research databases to back-of-the-book indexing and website indexing. Indexing is ‘the act of describing or identifying a document in terms of its subject content’ (ISO, [2015](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R9)). Even with the development of automatic indexing, the intellectual effort of human beings is still needed for quality and thoroughness. Quality of indexing has been considered to mean the same as retrieval effectiveness of indexing, and it suggests a relationship between indexing consistency and indexing quality (Rolling, [1981](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R16); Lancaster, [2003](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R10); Hjørland, [2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R7)).

‘Indexer consistency’, the descriptor in the ASIS&T thesaurus (Redmond-Neal and Hlava, [2005](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R15)), is defined as the extent to which different indexers, or the same indexer at different times, assign the same index terms to a given document. ‘Indexer consistency’ has the related terms ‘effectiveness’, ‘evaluation’, ‘indexing’, ‘reliability’, and the broader term ‘human attributes’. In the ERIC thesaurus (ERIC, [2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R4)), ‘consistency’ is a non-preferred term for ‘reliability’. One of 13 international cataloguing general principles (IFLA, [2017](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R8)) is consistency and standardization, which means that descriptions and construction of access points should be standardized as far as possible to enable consistency. If there is a conflict among these principles (other than convenience of the user), the principle of interoperability should be rated higher than others. For the sake of interoperability, the exchange of data and discovery tools, the use of vocabularies facilitating automatic translation and disambiguation is highly recommended. Consistency in indexing has been the goal to achieve and is closely associated with standardization, interoperability, and reliability, to ensure that the same subject content is indexed with the consistent term to be aggregated together and discriminated from other items in information retrieval.

The research presented here aims to enrich our understanding of inter-indexer consistency by addressing the following questions:

•

Are there patterns in inter-indexer consistency?

•

Can we theorize inter-indexer consistency?

## Previous research on inter-indexer consistency

Inconsistency in indexing has been consistently documented in the literature, which can be traced back to the 1960s (Olson and Wolfram, [2008](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R14)). It was found that in all phenomena related to words, consistency rarely exceeded 25 per cent (Saracevic, [1988](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R17)). Another study concluded that consistency ratings averaged 27 per cent when using uncontrolled vocabulary, but improved considerably to an average of 44 per cent when using a controlled vocabulary (Leinnger, [2000](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R11)).

The quality and consistency of indexing depend on factors such as the qualifications and expertise of the indexer and the quality of the indexing tools (ISO, [2015](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R9)). A more exhaustive list of possible factors that affect indexing consistency includes the number of terms assigned, controlled vocabulary versus free-text indexing, the size and specificity of vocabulary, the characteristics of the subject matter and its terminology, indexer factors, tools available to the indexer, and the length of the item to be indexed (Lancaster, [2003](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R10)). The more concepts are represented, the lower the consistency, and as the size of the vocabulary grows so the consistency drops (Olson and Boll, [2001](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R13)). ‘Total consistency among indexers is difficult to achieve, even when they use the same controlled vocabulary and attempt to follow the same indexing policies’ (Chan, [1989](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R1): 357). Remedies for the problem might be better selection and training of indexers, better work conditions, and a collaborative approach to the task (Fumani, [2010](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R5)).

As stated by Weinberg ([2017](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R18)), throughout the history of indexing, despite important principles such as exhaustivity, specificity, and coextensiveness, there are no true theories of indexing, which is in turn a reflection that human indexing is highly inconsistent. However, Hjørland ([2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R7)) considers that indexing theories may be implicit, unrecognized or unarticulated, and have a profound impact on the ways in which indexing is practiced, taught, and researched. Furthermore, he argues that four positions in epistemology are fundamental and provide a very powerful way of analyzing theories of indexing: rationalism (basing knowledge on logic, principles, rules, and idealized models), empiricism (basing knowledge on observations and on inductions from a pool of observations), historicism (basing research on social contexts, historical developments, and the explication of researchers’ pre-understanding), and pragmatism (basing knowledge on the analysis of goals, purposes, values, and consequences) (Hjørland, [2009](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R6)).

## Research methods

There are previous studies exploring indexing inconsistency using student assignments (Lancaster, [2003](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R10); Olson and Wolfram, [2008](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R14)). The study reported here was stimulated by a graduate-level indexing course the researcher has taught for an MLIS program. One assignment, ‘Journal Indexing and Abstracting’, asks students to write an informative abstract for a scholarly article by David et al. ([1995](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R3)),<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> to assign terms from two thesauri to describe the subject content of that article, and to compare this with the author abstract and the ERIC abstract and index terms. The indexing part of this assignment was used for the research reported on here.

The David et al. article was selected because it has been classic reading for indexing classes. To understand inter-indexer consistency, the David et al. article examined the process of problem solving in indexing using theories and methods of cognitive psychology; four experienced indexers were asked to assign subject terms to two documents each using a thesaurus familiar to them, with three kinds of verbal report (think aloud, retrospective verbalization, peer-evaluation interview). It was concluded that the indexing task was considered an ill-defined problem, where the solution was partly defined by the indexer, and that although more work was needed, the problem-solving approach would be promising in explaining the intellectual process of indexing.

The researcher sent a message to five classes of the indexing course in the years 2016 and 2017 to obtain students’ permission to collect data from the assignments they submitted. A total of 98 students responded by signing the consent form via DocuSign as an agreement to participate in the study.

The assignment instructions, also the experimental procedure, were as follows:

0

Suppose this article is included in a journal for LIS researchers and professionals.

1

Write down the approach or method you use to determine the subject matter of this article.

2

Translate the subject matter into a set of index terms:

2.1

Derive terms from the article that you think cover the subject of the article. The terms must be present in the article. State why you chose that particular set of terms.

2.2

Come up with terms you feel cover the subject better, if any, though they are not present in the article. State why you chose that particular set of terms.

2.3

Based on what you got from 2.1 and 2.2, assign terms from both ASIS&T thesaurus and ERIC thesaurus to the article that you think best represent the subject of the article. View the Panopto video _Indexing with thesaurus_ for how to use these two online thesauri. Limit the total number of index terms to 5–10. Combine terms from two thesauri into one list, and for each term indicate from which thesaurus it was taken. Indicate which of your terms are major descriptors and which are minor descriptors. State why you chose that particular set of terms.

3

Compare your final index terms in 2.3 with the terms with which this article was indexed in ERIC via EBSCO and ERIC via ProQuest.

Though the students were not professional indexers, they had received sufficient training from the course to complete the assignment. It was an online course and the students lived in different geographic areas and completed the assignment at different times. This assignment adopted both derived-indexing and assigned-indexing approaches. For derived indexing, terms used for indexing are taken directly from the source document. For assigned indexing, the indexer may assign terms that do not occur in the source document; they may be free expressions or controlled vocabularies.

## Results

### Quantitative results

Excel was used to sort all valid index terms collected from the student assignments – those are the preferred terms that are available in the ASIS&T thesaurus or in the ERIC thesaurus and were indicated as major or minor descriptors by participants. A total number of 94 usable responses was collected from five classes (27 responses in fall 2017, 17 responses in summer 2017, 21 responses in spring 2017, 18 responses in fall 2016, 11 responses in summer 2016). The results are presented below.

[Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#F1) shows the total number of major descriptors and minor descriptors assigned by all participants from five classes. [Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#F2) shows the number of unique major descriptors and minor descriptors. For example, for the spring semester of 2017, there are 88 major descriptors in total but 31 unique major descriptors. Among the 88 major descriptors, the descriptor ‘indexing’ was assigned by 15 participants and was taken as 15 counts in [Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#F1). However, in [Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#F2), the descriptor ‘indexing’ was counted as a single term; that is, one out of 31 unique major descriptors. Also, for spring 2017, there are 66 minor descriptors in total but 47 unique minor descriptors, and the descriptor ‘indexing’ was only two counts, as in [Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#F1).

The major descriptors assigned by more than two people across five classes are shown in [Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#F3). Across five classes, the descriptors ‘indexing’, ‘problem solving’, ‘cognitive processes’, ‘indexer consistency’, and ‘cognitive psychology’ remain the top terms, with a frequency from the mid-70s to the lower 30s. Of the above 14 major descriptors, six are available only in the ASIS&T thesaurus (indexer consistency, subject indexing, thesauri, index terms, cognitive models, controlled vocabularies), four are available only in the ERIC thesaurus (cognitive processes, cognitive psychology, indexes, verbal communication), and the remaining terms can be found in both thesauri.

The minor descriptors assigned by more than two people across five classes are shown in [Figure 4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#F4). The terms are distributed much more evenly, with the highest frequency counted only as 20, for ‘cognitive psychology’. All major descriptors also appear as minor descriptors except ‘cognitive models’ and ‘controlled vocabularies’. Of the above 27 minor descriptors, nine are available only in the ASIS&T thesaurus (indexing exhaustivity, indexing specificity, thesauri, descriptors, index terms, subject indexing, knowledge, indexer consistency, indexing depth), eight are available only in the ERIC thesaurus (cognitive psychology, cognitive processes, protocol analysis, verbal communication, expertise, indexes, peer evaluation, verbal tests), and the remaining terms can be found in both thesauri.

The assigned terms from the ERIC thesaurus belong to a set of broad categories educational process: school perspectives, information/communications systems, labor and employment, language and speech, learning and perception, measurement, mental health, publication/document types, research and theory, science and technology, social processes and structures, and tests and scales. There are broader, narrower, and/or related thesaural relationships among most of these terms in the ERIC thesaurus; the exceptions are ‘content analysis’, ‘expertise’, ‘reliability’, ‘verbal communication’, and ‘verbal tests’, which do not have any thesaural relationship with any other assigned ERIC term.

The assigned terms from the ASIS&T thesaurus are under the facets of activities and operations, attributes, document types, fields and disciplines, knowledge and information, language, and research and analytic methods. ‘Content analysis’, ‘information retrieval’, ‘knowledge’, and ‘standards’ are the only terms that do not have any thesaural relationship with any other assigned ASIS&T term.

For each of the five classes, the major descriptors ‘indexing’ and ‘problem solving’ are the stable top two terms for each class; for the minor descriptors, either ‘cognitive processes’ or ‘cognitive psychology’ ranks first for each class.

The participants were instructed to assign five to ten terms in total. For those clearly indicated as major descriptors and minor descriptors, on average, each participant assigned fewer than four major descriptors (3.83) and over three minor descriptors (3.34).

### Qualitative results

The participants were asked to write down the approach or method they used to determine the subject matter, why they chose that particular set of terms when deriving terms from the article, how they came up with their own terms and assigned terms from two thesauri, and how they compared their final terms and the index terms in the ERIC records. The participants’ statements of their rationale, thoughts, and decisions at different stages of indexing are valuable qualitative data and are summarized as follows.

#### Approach/method to determine the subject matter

Participants usually first read through the article to understand what it was about, to get a general idea of the main theme of the article. Then they reread and highlighted or underlined the important terms that appeared to indicate the ‘aboutness’ of the article or that were key to the study. They also took notes or wrote an aboutness statement for terms that they felt were important and could possibly use as index terms. They sometimes read the article again to see if they had missed anything. They also looked at the different sections of the article, such as the title, abstract, headings, first and last sentences of paragraphs, introduction and conclusion, tables and figures, and callout words and phrases. Some also asked themselves key questions or kept in mind how users would search and find the article. They parsed down the list of terms by removing duplicate and similar terms, combining like terms into one broader term, and deleting terms that they felt did not represent the article as well as they had initially thought.

#### Deriving terms

These were the terms that were most consistently used throughout and occurred the most or stood out from the text. They were terms that represented major concepts and overall subjects rather than details, that best encompassed the aboutness of the article and were most closely related to the themes.

#### Coming up with terms

Some participants could not think of more terms to add. Those who did added their own terms for the following reasons:

•

as an alternative to represent the term in the text

•

more commonly used synonyms or in more natural language

•

more general or broader terms

•

more specific and more accurately speaking to the point

•

implied from the content, not explicitly mentioned

•

only mentioned in passing but possibly important enough to look into further

•

related or associated concept

•

complementing the initial terms

•

increasing searchability or user accessibility to the article.

#### Assigning terms from thesauri

Though some students found the closest match from two thesauri, others were unable to find a perfect match and ended up with the closest approximation. Some gave up finding an equivalent term after determining that the concept could be represented by other terms; they chose a broader, narrower, or related term, or were prompted to use some other terms suggested by the thesauri. As stated, by the participants:

> Goal structures do not exist in ERIC or ASIS&T. A search for ‘goals’ alone in ERIC brings up the term Objectives, Use for Goals. The scope note for objectives states, ‘Aims or ends toward which effort is directed – use a more specific term if possible’. David et al. (1995) refer to goal structures as the nature of the goal of the participants. The scope note of the related term ‘Goal orientation’ states that it is the ‘\[p\]sychological disposition toward achieving one’s objectives’. It is selected as the best fit for David et al.’s description of goal structures, fitting the context better than such terms as ‘achievement need’ or ‘psychological needs’.
> 
> ‘Consistency’, to my surprise, was better represented by an even narrower term in the ASIS&T thesaurus (‘indexer consistency’). I was not able to locate ‘problem spaces’ as a term and a bit of additional outside research led me to feel that it is represented well enough by the broader term ‘problem solving’. ‘Concurrent verbalization’ may have been most nearly represented by ‘observational research’ from the ASIS&T thesaurus, but I felt this was too broad and decided to abandon the term. ‘Subjectivity’ was difficult to locate but I thought it was important enough to try to represent, and came closest with ‘individual differences’.

They decided on major descriptors because the terms covered the general topics and the main subject matter, i.e. they were what the entire article was constantly about. They decided on minor descriptors because the terms were more general or specific but were also related, or were not discussed throughout the entire article but directly supported or worked best in conjunction with one or more of the major descriptors, and provided further detail about the main subject matter. They attempted to find a balance between specificity and exhaustivity with selected terms. They also considered terms for users who were outside the field but might still find the article helpful, and terms that might make it easy to locate the article.

#### Comparing with ERIC terms

When comparing with the index terms assigned in the ERIC records, the participants emphasized their terms that were in common with the terms from ProQuest and EBSCO but realized that some terms they had included were unnecessary and vague and some were not specific enough. There were terms that provided a good, succinct way to describe research methodology employed in the article, such as ‘protocol analysis’, that were overlooked or missed by participants. They considered some terms to be too broad, such as ‘cognitive psychology’, and other terms to be too similar or repetitive, since they came from the same field, such as ‘cognitive processes’. Some participants left out ‘cognitive processes’, a broader term for ‘problem solving’, which they had already included. They also raised questions about terms like ‘thesauri’ and ‘verbal communication’ assigned in the ERIC records, since these terms were incidental factors involved in the study, merely an aspect of the research method, so their role in the article was not significant enough to warrant being used as a descriptor. There were some ERIC terms that they originally included but had later decided to leave off their final list. They felt that the ERIC terms went in a different direction and focused more on psychology and methodology. They also mentioned that thesaurus knowledge and domain knowledge would be beneficial for indexing the article.

## Discussion

### Are there patterns of inter-indexer consistency?

First, the findings verify the conclusions in the David et al. (1995) paper that there can be high agreement among multiple indexers with respect to basic semantic content, but that there may be variations with respect to the degrees of specificity, exhaustivity, and exactitude. Inconsistency is reflected in variations in the number of concepts represented, the breadth of subject matter covered (exhaustivity), in the level of hierarchical detail, the depth of subject matter covered (specificity), and in the match between the terms available in the vocabulary and the concepts represented in the document (coextensiveness, part of the reason for exactitude).

Comparing [Figures 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#F1) and [2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#F2), it can be seen that participants assigned a similar number of major and minor descriptors, but far fewer unique major descriptors than unique minor descriptors; in other words, fewer major descriptors were assigned by more participants. [Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#F3) shows that the top five major descriptors constitute 67.5 per cent of all major descriptors assigned, while [Figure 4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#F4) shows that the top five minor descriptors only constitute 22.7 per cent of all minor descriptors assigned. All of this suggests that there is more consistency in the central and essential terms but far less consistency in the secondary and peripheral terms. Olson and Wolfram’s study (2008) found that few terms were agreed by many participants whereas many terms were uniquely identified; however, they did not ask the participants to indicate major and minor terms. The differentiation between major and minor descriptors in this research strongly reveals that the level of consistency varies considerably between major descriptors and minor descriptors.

The results from these five classes are representative enough, since the classes from subsequent semesters exhibit the same pattern: the top major descriptors constitute a higher proportion of all major descriptors, while the top minor descriptors constitute a lower proportion of all minor descriptors. There are more variations among minor descriptors than among major descriptors, for all terms as well as the top terms.

Further, the findings did not fully echo the statement by Olson and Boll (2001) that consistency may be affected by the number of concepts represented and the size of vocabulary used. The research reported here asked participants to assign five to ten terms from two thesauri. Olson and Wolfram’s (2008) study asked participants to provide up to five terms, with no controlled vocabularies. The degree of consistency may be higher when using a controlled vocabulary than when using the uncontrolled vocabulary. However, the increased number of index terms and the use of controlled vocabularies did not seem to change the finding of more consistency in major descriptors than in minor descriptors.

The David et al. article was indexed in the ERIC database via EBSCO and ProQuest. They include the same set of index terms:

> descriptors: cognitive processes, cognitive psychology, indexing, problem solving, protocol analysis, thesauri, verbal communication
> 
> identifier/keyword: expert novice paradigm.

The ERIC databases are for users of educational resources, who are different from the target audience (LIS researchers and professionals) for the David et al. article in this research, and the terms in the ERIC database records are assigned from the ERIC thesaurus only. Two thesauri were used in this research and the ASIS&T thesaurus better suits the needs of the library and information science discipline. The top five major descriptors in this research are ‘indexing’, ‘problem solving’, ‘cognitive processes’, ‘indexer consistency’, and ‘cognitive psychology’; although four of them match four terms indexed in the ERIC records, the most significant term for the article, ‘indexer consistency’, is only available in the ASIS&T thesaurus. The participants also felt it was fortunate to have this term available to select.

ERIC via ProQuest distinguished between major and minor terms, marking ‘cognitive psychology’, ‘indexing’, and ‘problem solving’ as major. If we compare the participants’ terms with these three major terms, it again shows that consistency is higher for central and essential terms, with the use of the same thesaurus (ERIC Thesaurus) and a different thesaurus (ASIS&T Thesaurus).

### Can we theorize inter-indexer consistency?

The qualitative data provide an insight into the underlying reasons for inconsistency at different stages of the indexing process: deriving terms from text, coming up with their own terms, assigning terms from controlled vocabularies, approaches to subject analysis, personal understanding of the main concepts of the article, consideration of the target users as well as information search and retrieval, the impact of the descriptor availability and thesaurus display, the terms successfully found or not, the terms suggested, and so on. The participants’ thoughts and actions may represent one or more of the four positions suggested by Hjørland (2019): rationalist, empiricist, historicist, or pragmatist views. The cognitive view, which is based on rationalism, though it has been criticized, cannot be ignored as a valuable perspective to understanding indexing inconsistency.

Subject is the concept of a work and can be represented by a linguistic description; however, can a linguistic description fully and accurately represent the concept of a work? Can the user understand the subject through the linguistic description in the same way as the indexer? And can any indexer grasp the concept of a work and assign the linguistic description in the same manner? Inconsistency occurs between the subject term available and the concept it represents, between the indexer’s term selection and the concept the indexer understands, between the user’s understanding of the subject term and what the indexer intends to convey, and so on. Even a different approach to subject analysis may result in term variations: i.e. Wilson’s four methods – purposive method, figure-ground method, objective method, cohesion method (Mai, [2000](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R12)). Inconsistency occurs not only between different indexers, but also between different stages in indexing for the same indexer, and may also be influenced by other people’s choices.

We do not yet have any general theories of indexing, but instead some general principles based on empirical data, experiences, and shared common sense, and further research in indexing is called for (Cleveland and Cleveland, [2013](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.16#core-R2)). The existing principles of indexing, such as exhaustivity, specificity, consistency, and coextensiveness, are more descriptive than explorative. Lancaster (2003) addressed exhaustivity and specificity: a concept should be indexed under the most specific term that entirely covers it (principle of specificity); if the generic term is assigned together with the specific term, it is difficult for the user who searches for the generic term to distinguish general articles from specific ones. However, general principles as such have not been properly applied; for example, the ERIC records assigned the descriptor ‘problem solving’ and its broader term ‘cognitive processes’ at the same time. The Library of Congress (LC) policy instructs that headings should be assigned only for topics that comprise at least 20 per cent of the work; sometimes one heading is sufficient, generally a maximum of six is appropriate, and no more than ten headings should be assigned to a work. However, the multiple records for exactly the same item in different library databases show a great variation in numbers and specificity of LC subject headings. Various types of guidelines and instructions should be provided for both conceptual analysis and translation in order to aid consistency (Olson and Boll, 2001).

## Conclusion

This research was limited to the indexing of one article by participants who were not professional indexers. Nevertheless, the findings confirm that far more consistency exists in major descriptors than in minor descriptors and suggest that a combination of various views may help to enrich our understanding of the underlying reasons for indexing inconsistency.
