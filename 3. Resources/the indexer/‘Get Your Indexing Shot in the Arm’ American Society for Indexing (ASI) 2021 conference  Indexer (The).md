## Abstract

Benefiting from lessons learnt during the hastily organized 2020 online conference, the American Society for Indexing’s 2021 conference was a less intensive affair, with six presentations spread over two days and a little more time allowed for breaks. With over 70 participants from around the world, this was another international affair, with a wide-ranging programme covering the practice of indexing (working more efficiently, embedded indexing), career development, unusual indexing projects (the Mueller report index), and more thought-provoking topics (indexing through the ages, the challenges of musical literature). There was even time for some networking and informal discussion during the ‘Happy Hour’ at the end of the first day.

In 2020, as COVID-19 swept around the world, conferences were forced to either abandon their plans completely or move into the virtual environment. Benefiting from its experience in running webinars, the American Society for Indexing (ASI) was able to quickly convert its planned conference into a successful online event – ‘Working Smarter to Stay Ahead’ (see [Li, 2020)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.30#core-R3). In 2021, there was again no question of holding a face-to-face conference, so another online conference was planned from the outset, with the theme ‘Get Your Indexing Shot in the Arm’. The conference was held on 30 April and 1 May.

The 2020 event had been concentrated into one day, with six 50-minute presentations separated by ten-minute breaks (with a 30-minute break in the middle). This had proved to be rather intense, risking ‘Zoom fatigue’ and lapses in concentration. The 2021 conference was a little more leisurely, with only three 45-minute presentations on each day, with 15-minute periods for questions and 15-minute breaks between each session. Spreading the conference over two days also helped to deal with the challenge of multiple time zones. For this indexer, and several other members of the (UK) Society of Indexers who attended, the conference took place after the normal working day, beginning at 6 p.m. (7 p.m. for those in mainland Europe) and finishing between 9.30 and 10.30 p.m. on both days. Inevitably the majority of participants were based in North America; for those on the eastern seaboard it began in the early afternoon, at 1 p.m., while those on Pacific time were logging on at 10 a.m.

As one would expect, this was a professionally run conference. Generally things went smoothly and the timetable was scrupulously adhered to, though there were one or two technical hitches. However, these did not seriously affect proceedings. Both days began with a welcome from ASI executive director Gwen Henson, who set out a few basic rules of Zoom etiquette – muting while presentations were being delivered, turning off video if one had to leave the room for any reason (not that everyone seemed to have taken this on board), and using the chat function or the raised-hand icon to ask questions. Gwen acted as the technical supremo, while conference chair Devon Thomas took on the role of moderator, basically checking the chat for questions and feeding these to presenters as and when appropriate, usually at the end of each presentation.

## Day one

### _Time-saving tips_

The first day began with Connie Binder asserting ‘You can do it! Maximize your data-entry efficiency!’ This session was full of practical time-saving tips for freelance indexers. Whether one is paid by the page, the word count or the project as a whole, ‘an easy way to increase your income is to increase your speed. The more work you can do, the more money you make (or the more free time you have!)’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.30#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> The tips were summarized in a useful handout, and as Connie stated at the outset, if participants learned nothing new, then they were already very efficient! For this indexer at least, it was apparent that time spent learning more time-saving techniques would be time well spent.

The presentation was divided into five main sections:

1

_Abbreviations and acronyms_ – set these up for frequently used words and phrases to save an incredible amount of time and keying.

2

_Macros_ – replace a series of keystrokes with a single one.

3

_Bulk imports_ – establish preliminary index entries by importing data from Word files, PDF files or even previous indexes (e.g. tables of contents, glossary, lists of names).

4

_Indexing software junctions_ – become familiar with functions such as autocomplete and using labels.

5

_Keyboard shortcuts_ – learn shortcuts for commonly used functions to reduce the time one’s fingers leave the keyboard.

These various time-saving techniques were demonstrated using the Cindex software tool, but it was pointed out that they are equally applicable to other programs used by professional indexers, such as Macrex and SKY Index Professional, and the handout included some information on both these programs. Throughout the session (and, indeed, throughout the conference) there was a steady stream of comments and questions in the Zoom chat, with some questions being answered straight away directly in the chat.

During the 15-minute break following this session, those remaining at their screens chatted among themselves, one prominent topic proving to be ‘lockdown hair’! Participants who normally met at annual conferences had not seen one another since before the imposition of lockdown restrictions and noted their changed appearance.

### _Indexing without a client_

The next session was a double act with Peter Rooney (indexer) and Julia Rooney (visual artist) presenting ‘Indexing without a client – the Mueller report’. Although slightly marred by bandwidth problems, this was a fascinating insight into a significant indexing project. As readers of _The Indexer_ already know (see [Rooney, 2021)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.30#core-R4), this important document was issued without an index, and although several commercial publishers prepared their own editions, none included proper indexes. Since this was a serious omission for this well-researched and highly detailed report, Peter took the ambitious step of creating and publishing an index on his own account. In this session he outlined the process, including the use of the table of contents to provide a basic framework of entries (as advocated in Connie Binder’s presentation), how to deal with the metatopic (Donald Trump) and the tricky issue of the redacted text (which will inevitably change) and how to reflect this in subsequent editions of the index; this latter issue led to some discussion in the Zoom chat.

Peter also discussed the differences and challenges of an ‘independent’ index (in comparison with a commissioned one) in terms of time frame, budget, indexing guidelines, distribution platform and audience. Briefly taking a more philosophical approach and considering the function of the index, he suggested that each index is an interpretation of the text by that particular indexer. This is somewhat analogous to the art world, where ‘official’ portraits are generally prepared to suit the subject, whereas satirical cartoons reflect the artist’s interpretation of the subject.

The presentation moved on to a demonstration by Julia of the website she had designed,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.30#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> which includes helpful tips on using the index and where the report can also be read alongside the index. The final part of the presentation covered the efforts to publicize this venture (via email, a mailing campaign and some press and media coverage, including a podcast interview with Peter<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.30#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup>) and consideration of possible print options (see [Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.30#F2)), for which Julia had prepared a promotional video. These included a stand-alone version rather like a pocket calendar and a beautiful, hand-illuminated artistic version which very cleverly incorporated allusions to Russian art.

### _A musical interlude_

After another 15-minute break, which included discussion about personal indexing projects for one’s own use and the issue of books published without indexes to avoid the ‘Washington read’,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.30#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup> the final session of the day turned to music, with Daniel Heila on ‘Forget the theme: mind the variations’. Although primarily focusing on classical music, this presentation ranged widely, looking at the elasticity and variation of terms and concepts within musical literature – historical, theoretical and biographical. The handout included a list of useful reference sources.

Daniel began by looking at stylistic eras, showing how they do not always correspond with similarly named artistic eras, especially during the twentieth century, and also pointed out that the work of many composers was not always confined to one era. He gave some interesting examples from minimalism, but sadly the planned audio excerpts to illustrate this and other sections of the presentation failed to materialize, despite having worked perfectly in the rehearsal.

Turning to music theory and notation he outlined the development of the five-line notation and time signatures we are familiar with today, but also included a series of slides illustrating examples where composers had escaped these traditional confines, with scores virtually evolving into visual art. Next he considered ‘the humble triad’, emphasizing the need to be aware of its complexity and variations in different musical modes. And as with any subject involving people, the often tricky issue of names was also touched on. Daniel noted the complex genealogy of, for example, the Bach family, with its large number of Johanns, and issued a warning to be aware of varying spellings of the same name.

The final minutes of this session were devoted to a somewhat rarefied consideration of whether music is simply organized sound, whether sounds led to language, whether writing is organized words, and what, therefore, indexing is.

As a footnote to this session, it is worth mentioning that some of Daniel’s indexing examples led to a somewhat heated discussion in the Zoom chat on the position of ‘and’ in subheadings and the subtle distinction implied by using a comma before it. Perhaps an article on this issue is called for.

### _Happy Hour_

The day concluded with a ‘Happy Hour’: participants were urged to ‘grab your favorite libation and come chat with your fellow indexers. Let’s celebrate the wonder of indexing by sharing some of the favorite things we have learned from our projects. Party hats are encouraged but not required!’<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.30#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup> Many of the participants remaining for this did indeed sport a wide variety of hats; indexers enjoy discussing the finer points of indexing but they do also let their (lockdown) hair down on occasions!

## Day two

### _The history and purposes of indexing_

Day 2 began with a fascinating presentation from Michele Combs, incoming ASI president, on ‘The order of things: indexing then and now’. She prefaced her talk with a warning that it was by no means comprehensive, that it was essentially Eurocentric, and that she was indebted to scholars including Ann Blair, Dennis Duncan and Bella Hass Weinberg for their detailed research on index history.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.30#fn6" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn6">6</a></sup> Nevertheless, she hoped that the audience would find it engaging, inspiring and fun. Judging by the plethora of comments in the Zoom chat, she more than fulfilled her aims; participants thoroughly enjoyed it, one fairly new member of ASI describing it as ‘affirming, inspiring, and motivational’.

In a brief report it is difficult to reflect the breadth of this whistle-stop tour through indexing history, looking at the index as an object (in the form of an A–Z list), as an access tool and as an explosive device, with each section illustrated by many beautiful images. Michele began back in the fourteenth century bc, with the origins of writing and the alphabet (obviously essential for an A–Z list), moving swiftly on to the development of the book by way of the scroll and codex. She emphasized the role of Christianity and ‘natural’, hierarchical order (from God and the Pope down to the meanest peasant) and how the earliest indexes (mostly to religious texts) required users to have considerable prior knowledge of this. This section was illustrated by particularly beautiful manicules from medieval texts.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.30#fn7" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn7">7</a></sup>

It was not until the advent of the printing press and the dramatic increase in the number of books, together with the changing intellectual landscape in which religion was challenged and readers wanted access to _knowledge_, that indexes became more widespread. By the eighteenth century, a period of massive encyclopedia publication, some writers were waxing lyrical about indexes, but they were not without their critics, who regarded indexes with scepticism.

Turning finally to the thought-provoking idea of the index as an explosive device, Michele focused on how it empowers the reader, rather than the author, by presenting information in a neutral manner, determined purely by the accident of spelling. She also referred to the work of Urs [Stäheli (2016)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.30#core-R5) on indexing as the politics of invisibility, and there was some discussion about the use of (biased) algorithms in the way information is presented through Internet searches.

Although the conference programme suggested that after listening to this presentation participants would be able to amaze their friends and family ‘with fascinating trivia!’, this was certainly fascinating but definitely not trivia.

### _Embedded indexing_

After the usual 15-minute break, for the second session of the day we turned to more technical issues with Heather Pendley and Devon Thomas on ‘Embedded indexing: tackling the enigma’, for which a useful handout was also provided. Increasingly indexers are being asked about creating embedded indexes, whether in Microsoft Word and Adobe InDesign, or using mark-up languages, and it is becoming an important skill to offer clients. For anyone unsure where to begin and feeling intimidated by the technical requirements, Heather and Devon explained how embedded indexing differs from back-of-the-book in terms of both the book production and indexing processes. They showed examples of several kinds of embedded indexes and gave a quick overview of some of the tools available to create them, counselling against working in Word or InDesign but instead using add-ons to dedicated indexing software (such as Cindex, Macrex and SKY Index Professional). A short demonstration of the program Index-Manager showed the advantage of using integrated software, which does away with the need to have separate indexing and embedding software.

Heather and Devon asserted that although embedded indexing can be very satisfying, it is important to allow extra time to deal with possible problems developing at a late stage in the process. Other workflow tips included

•

think ahead to save time on editing at a later stage.

However, although the emphasis in this session was on technical practicalities, they stressed that the actual textual analysis and indexing was still the core part of the job.

For learning more about embedded indexing, the ASI Digital Publications Special Interest Group was recommended as a resource, and the workshops and training sessions provided by indexing societies were also mentioned. It was also pointed out that developers of indexing software are always very helpful, with Katharina Munk of Index-Manager running regular sessions for both beginners and more advanced users. As an optional extra, all conference participants were entitled to attend the ‘Software segments’ session on 6 May, where Cindex, Macrex, SKY Index Professional, Index-Manager and IndexExploit were to be covered in more detail and participants’ questions answered.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.30#fn8" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn8">8</a></sup>

This session was ostensibly aimed primarily at indexers needing to find out more about embedded indexing, but there is always more to learn, and undoubtedly the more experienced will also have found it useful. In addition, it provided a great opportunity for the exchange of information as participants pooled their expertise. Amongst the issues raised was publishers’ lack of understanding of embedded indexing and the unsuitability of some of their systems and procedures, due at least in part to the lack of communication between publishers’ software designers and indexers. Despite problems such as these, participants were left with the impression that embedded indexing was something worth getting into, with several indicating that it provided them with a steady stream of work.

### _Marketing, work management and the work-life balance_

During the 15-minute break before the final conference session, participants were invited to unmute and say where they were from (or post this information in the chat). Naturally the majority were from within the US or Canada (several finding that they had connections with the same location), but there were also about half a dozen UK indexers and several from continental Europe. Several participants added interesting domestic details, helping to paint a picture of the varied environment of the freelance indexer.

The conference concluded with a presentation by Nan Badgett, ‘Inside the accidental indexer’, which discussed themes from her ([2015](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.30#core-R1)) book _The accidental indexer_ – including marketing, work management and work-life balance – to help both new and experienced indexers move their businesses forward. The title reflected the fact that around half of freelance book indexers find themselves in the profession almost accidentally, perhaps through having to undertake indexing as part of their paid employment, for example.

In progressing a freelance career, Nan emphasized the crucial role of marketing and the dangers of relying on work from one particular client, since editors come and go and internal reorganization can lead to work drying up. Selling oneself so that one stands out from the crowd may take place through many channels – chance conversations, email campaigns, networking, volunteering, social media, blogs and writing articles – and having a 30-second ‘elevator story’ about who one is and what one does is a useful asset. It goes without saying that indexers need not only to be good at their job but also to convey a professional image (e.g. logo, website), abide by professional codes of conduct and provide a good customer service – saying what they will do and doing what they say.

Effective time and work management are vital skills for the freelancer. In addition to the efficient working practices advocated in Connie Binder’s presentation, Nan urged participants to set realistic goals, adopt schedules that suit their own pattern of working and avoid distractions (emails, phone calls and so on). She recommended the value of ‘ta da!’ lists rather than ‘to-do’ lists, and suggested that procrastination could be due to either the HALT scenario (hungry, angry, lonely, tired) or actually being stuck grappling with a difficult text. The solution to this latter situation is to ask for help or actually take a break, perhaps by going out for a walk to clear the mind.

Turning to the final section of her presentation, Nan talked about the importance to the freelancer of work–life balance, self-care strategies and avoiding burnout. Setting boundaries, scheduling movement/exercise into each day, eating well, taking breaks and ‘getting a life’ should all be essential parts of the indexer’s everyday life.

During each section of the presentation, participants contributed their own experiences and tips in the Zoom chat, confirming and adding to Nan’s suggestions, and the handout provided a useful summary of the main points, together with recommendations of additional resources.

## A conference for all?

Planning an online conference, while in some ways easier than a face-to-face one (see [Kingdom, 2021)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.30#core-R2), also faces constraints. Without setting up breakout rooms to enable concurrent sessions for indexers with different interests and levels of experience, the challenge is to organize a programme that will appeal to both new and very experienced indexers. These two groups may have different objectives in attending a conference. The ‘newbies’ want to learn as much as possible about their new profession, picking up tips on indexing practices and on how to build up a client base, as well as networking with their more experienced peers. For the more experienced, renewing friendships forged over the years is an important aspect, and in terms of professional development, they are looking to hone their existing skills and perhaps branch out in new directions. How did this ASI conference measure up to the demands of these two groups? Did we all get our ‘shot in the arm’ to ready us for another year of indexing?

Judging by the many congratulatory comments in the Zoom chat, the organizers got it about right. For this indexer, nearing the end of her career, there was certainly enough of interest to make it worth attending all six sessions; two days immersed in all things indexing is always an enjoyable experience. One very new indexer, part way through the Society of Indexers (SI) training course, also very much enjoyed it and ‘learnt so much about a range of topics’. She had been worried that she was too inexperienced to attend but was grateful to her SI tutor for encouraging her to do so. She found it useful to put names to faces, of both the UK and international attendees, and ‘felt privileged to have been able to do this so soon into my indexing career’. She felt the conference was pitched at an accessible level for students, commenting,

> although because of time constraints, some of the talks had a lot of information delivered in an hour. For example, the ‘Embedded Indexing’ talk was a speedy baptism of fire! I didn’t know much about embedded indexing, but by the end of the session I’d learnt a lot and I’m now interested in learning more … I found all the talks inspiring and fascinating and the conference provided a good snapshot of what ‘real’ indexers are doing and just how far-reaching indexes can be … I was especially inspired by Michele Combs’s talk about the history and origins of indexing – the concept of indexes as an ‘explosion of books and ideas’ especially resonated. As a beginner, I found some excellent tips on good practice – setting up macros and other time-saving strategies and about optimum marketing as a freelancer.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.30#fn9" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn9">9</a></sup>

In addition to professional development in the narrow sense, one of the benefits of a conference for freelance book indexers working largely in isolation is the chance to meet and network with one another. This is not so easy in the virtual environment, and more opportunities for networking and informal chat in smaller groups might have been welcome. The 15-minute breaks enabled participants to stretch their legs, grab a drink or a snack, and check that the rest of the household was under control, but there was little chance for much interaction. The ‘Happy Hour’ at the end of the first day seemed like a good idea, but after three fairly intense hours of concentration, many participants drifted away and this innovation was perhaps less successful than it might have been.

However, for those of us from the UK and continental Europe this online event was an opportunity to attend a conference that in normal circumstances we would have been unlikely to consider travelling to, given the constraints of distance and cost (constraints that will also have applied to many of those from the US and Canada in relation to face-to-face conferences). This gave the conference a very welcome international feel; the world of indexing is not constrained by national boundaries and for such a small profession the value of such international collaboration should not be underestimated. And as with the COVID-19 vaccination, we will be ready for booster ‘shots in the arm’ in the form of future indexing conferences.
