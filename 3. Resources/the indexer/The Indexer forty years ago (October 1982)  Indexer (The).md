## Abstract

Hazel K. Bell, editor of _The Indexer_ from 1978 to 1995, reflects on the content of the journal 40 years ago. In this issue, she travels back to October 1982. Reflections on past issues are a regular feature in the journal. You can look further back in time with the ‘_The Indexer_ forty years ago’ series, which started in the September 2021 issue, or ‘_The Indexer_ thirty years ago’ series, which was published from 1991 to 2008.

_The Indexer_ issue of October 1982 (Volume 13, number 2) appeared in a significant year: this was both the silver jubilee of the Society of Indexers (SI) and the officially designated Information Technology Year in the UK.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.24#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> SI president Robert Collison made much of these points in his guest editorial. He suggested, ‘We have not given the needs of information technology as much attention as they deserve’, adding, ‘Since the majority of our members index in the area of the humanities, this neglect is to some extent excusable’.

His musings were followed by congratulatory messages on the Society’s 25th anniversary from the presidents of the American Society of Indexers (ASI – Mauro Pittaro), the Australian Society of Indexers (AusSI – Peter H. Dawe) and the Indexing and Abstracting Society of Canada (IASC – M. E. Mercer), and an account of SI’s silver jubilee AGM, complete with photograph of the birthday cake.

At this meeting the second Carey Award was presented by Collison to Leonard Montague Harrod (the first had gone to G. Norman Knight). The beautifully illustrated citation referred to Harrod’s work in developing indexer training and establishing official British and International Standards for indexing, and his 14-year editorship of _The Indexer_. This account was followed by Harrod’s own report of the award of the Wheatley Medal for 1981 to J. Edwin Holmstrom for compiling _The Analytical index to the publications of the Institution of Civil Engineers, January 1975–79_. On the facing page appeared an obituary (by Robert Collison) of Dr Holmstrom, who had died a month after the announcement of this Wheatley award. He was told of it in hospital by his wife, ‘and was, she says, absolutely delighted’.

Next in this issue came a page summarising the newsletters of the four affiliated societies. ASI reported that its membership was ‘450 and growing’ and that a new corporation, ‘Superindex, is merging the indexes of almost 1000 … reference books in science, engineering and medicine’. The SI newsletter reported the death of Richard Haig-Brown, ‘a most dedicated, enthusiastic and thoroughly businesslike member … who wrote the 18-page discussion paper in 1977, _Problems in determining fees for indexers_’.

Then came a report of the IASC 1982 AGM, a photograph of the Society of Indexers’ stand at the London Book Fair, and a report of an SI Brains Trust, which seemed chiefly concerned with indexers’ use of computers. At this, ‘Christopher Gowers pointed out the advantages of self-employed persons renting, rather than purchasing, equipment such as computers and cars, and then setting off rentals against tax’.

So the first ten pages of this 72-page issue were concerned with indexing-society matters. Articles followed on indexing family history and local newspapers; on compiling the first _Fiction Index_ (‘When we finished I had altogether almost a quarter of a million cards and slips. I calculated that if I had laid them out end-to-end they would have stretched for 19 miles’) and the _Cumulated Fiction Index 1975–1979_ (‘Fortunately my printers are happy to work from 5″ × 3″ slips, so no typing of manuscripts is required’); on translation (‘The author prefers indexing his own translations to translating the original indexes’); and a most entertaining article by Paul Barnett, ‘I can’t hear you for the silence’ (‘Some personal experiences … bedevilled by bad indexes … Some really ghastly examples of indexes … examined in excruciating detail’).

Two articles recorded the indexing of public inquiries: ‘Indexing a local planning enquiry: the experience of Belvoir’ and ‘Stansted inquiry: indexing documents using a microcomputer’. This second article included full technical details: ‘An Apple microcomputer was used, with the D.B. Master software package including a Report Generator … There were 8 items of input for each document … and the machine produced 5 index volumes’. This inquiry needed indexes to 1,800 documents in eight locations.

Indexing training was covered by James D. Anderson, who provided an eight-page survey of ‘Education for indexing in North America: course content, emphasis, and approach’.

Further instalments of the various _Indexer_ series continued. ‘Indexes Past’ provided dark examples: two nine-centimetre columns of unrelieved page numbers (in small print) for the entries for ‘Whitehall’ and ‘York, James, Duke of’, in _The diary of Samuel Pepys_ produced by Macmillan and Co. in 1925; and two examples of ‘mini-encyclopedia’ entries ‘designed for more spacious times’. ‘Indexers in fiction’ quoted from P. D. James’s _A mind to murder_, demonstrating ‘to what evil uses our professional labours may be put’.

Of five letters to the editor, four constituted exchanges: one between the critical Helga Perry and the librarian in charge of the _Index of nursing research_, and one between Hazel Bell and Judith Butcher about the reference to the sending of indexes to authors to check in _Copy-editing: the Cambridge handbook_. The fifth letter is a tonguein-cheek report from Dr John Gibson on ‘an epidemic of comma-itis in the country at present … an insistence on the use of commas in indexes in places where they serve no purpose at all’. Amongst the ‘theories of causation’ he discussed were: ‘the first … that it is due to infection by the comma bacillus (there actually is one); the second, favoured by psychoanalysis, that it is a regression to the curved position of the foetus _in utero_.’

‘Indexes reviewed’ comprised three columns of ‘Indexes praised’, four examples of ‘Two cheers!’, two columns of ‘Indexes censured’, two columns of ‘Indexes omitted’, and two addenda. In the 13-page Book Reviews section, 21 books were reviewed by 11 reviewers (five by Mary Piggott) and another 13 listed under the heading ‘Publications received and publications noted’. Earlier in this issue, under the heading ‘D-I-Y indexing’, appeared a hatchet job on Gordon Wells’s _The successful author’s handbook_, which included three pages of advice on compiling the index. In examining the index to this book, the review concluded,

> The quality of this index disastrously demonstrates that the do-it-yourself indexing here advocated simply will not serve.

The indefatigable Mary Piggott provided ‘fillers’ in this issue updating information relating to the National Federation of Abstracting and Indexing Services, the North American Cartographic Information Society, the International Federation of Documentation, the British Standards Institution and the Office of Arts and Libraries. The 14 other fillers included the following:

> I see the indexer, in all her variations (for indexing seems traditionally associated with women), persisting as an usherette in the pages of a book. Just as an usherette’s cinema may be a flea-pit showing a junk film, the poor indexer may be shining his/her light into indifferent material in poor surroundings; but if she’s doing her job, at least she won’t let you trip over a step, sit on someone else’s lap or walk into a wall (Allan Bula).

Three advertisements appear in this issue. On page 79 is a quarter-page notice in small type of COMPUTER-ASSISTED INDEXING ‘to run on microcomputers using the CP/M operating system … Capable … Easy to use … Fast’. For more details readers were advised to contact Hilary and Drusilla Calvert or Transam Microsystems; the system itself, which of course later became MACREX, was not named at this point. On page 119 another quarter-pager advertised INDEXING PROGRAMS FOR MICROCOMPUTERS developed by Dr A. C. Purton. This advertisement was appropriately positioned at the end of an article on ‘Computer-aided indexing with spitbol and textform’. On page 125 was a full-page advert for LISA, ‘A comprehensive abstracting service in library and information science’.

The back cover again showed quarter-page advertisements for the SI Register and the indexing correspondence course of the Rapid Results College,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.24#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> and half a page for _The Indexer_, as all issues of the previous two volumes did.

## Editor’s note

This is once again a significant year for the Society of Indexers, as it celebrates the 65th anniversary of its founding. I was intrigued by the Information Technology Year in the UK mentioned by Robert Collison in his Guest Editorial. However, I found it difficult to find much information about it online. Ironically, the entry in the UK National Archives states that the public document about it has not been digitised and cannot be downloaded! A document available from the Centre for Computing History website reveals that it was a UK nationwide awareness campaign about IT developments. So while technology has come far since 1982, there are still significant gaps in what it can do for us, particularly when it comes to exploring the past. Thank you to Hazel for reminding us of how much has happened not only in _The Indexer_ but also in the world over the past 40 years. The fact that the Society of Indexers is still going strong in 2022, despite the challenges that IT has brought to the indexing profession, is noteworthy.

The Society of Indexers had yet to develop its own indexing course.
