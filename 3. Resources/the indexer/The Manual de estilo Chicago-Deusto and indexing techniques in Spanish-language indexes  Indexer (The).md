## Abstract

### Abstract

Jochen Fassbender reviews the _Manual de estilo Chicago-Deusto_, which is the Spanish translation and adaptation of _The Chicago Manual of Style_, 16th edition. He looks specifically at Chapter 16 on indexes, compares the indexes to the two publications, and discusses how indexing techniques can be applied in Spanish-language indexes.

### Abstract

Jochen Fassbender reseña el _Manual de estilo Chicago-Deusto_ que es la edición traducida y adaptada al español de la 16.<sup>a</sup> edición del _Manual de estilo de Chicago._ Él examina específicamente el capítulo 16 sobre índices, compara los índices de ambas publicaciones y analiza cómo se pueden aplicar las técnicas de indización a los índices en español.

## Introduction

The _Manual de estilo Chicago-Deusto_ (_MeCD_) ([Torres Ripa, 2013](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#core-R17)) is the Spanish translation and adaptation of _The Chicago Manual of Style_, 16th edition _(CMS_ 16) _(Chicago Manual of Style_, 2010).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> According to the _MeCD_ preface by the editor, Javier Torres Ripa, the whole idea for this manual originated in 2011. With the multidisciplinary support of a large team of contributors, translators, and experts from academia and the publishing industry (including the University of Chicago Press), the _MeCD_ was published by the University of Deusto in Bilbao, Spain just two years later in 2013.

## General comparison of the _MeCD_ and _CMS_ 16

Usually a strict Spanish translation from an English text tends to be about 15–20 per cent longer than the original publication ([Perlman, 2006](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#core-R11): 93; [Cronshaw, 2008](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#core-R5): 54). However, _MeCD_ is also an adaptation. This is why comparing their sizes is not a simple matter. The Spanish version has almost 70 pages fewer than _CMS_ 16 (XIX + 956 compared with xvi + 1,026 pages; note that it is Spanish practice to use capital Roman numerals in the front matter). On the other hand, the page format of _MeCD_ is slightly larger (half a centimetre taller than _CMS_ 16), which may compensate somewhat for the difference in number of pages.

The general structure of the _MeCD_ closely follows the English-language original. Like _CMS_ 16, the main table of contents refers to page numbers, while the tables of contents at the beginning of each chapter are more detailed and refer to chapter/paragraph numbers. Altogether there are three parts with 16 chapters as well as three appendices and a bibliography in _MeCD_ (see [Table 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#T1)).

Ten out of 16 chapters have the same or almost the same number of paragraphs in both manuals but some chapters of _CMS_ 16 are considerably more comprehensive than those of _MeCD._ For example, Chapter 5 (Gramática y uso/Grammar and Usage) has 230 numbered paragraphs on more than 100 pages, while _MeCD_ has just 153 on half the number of pages, although there are paragraphs on homophones and paronyms that are lacking in _CMS_ 16. Chapter 4 (Gestión de los derechos de autor/Rights, Permissions, and Copyright Administration) has 101 numbered paragraphs on 44 pages, while the corresponding chapter in _MeCD_ has 75 on 33 pages; obviously, this chapter had to be considerably adapted to cover Spanish legal aspects. On the other hand, Chapter 8 of _CMS_ 16 (Nombres, titulos y otros términos/Names and Terms) has just 78 pages compared to 97 in _MeCD_, even though the total of 197 numbered paragraphs is 12 more than in _MeCD._ All in all there are 1,933 numbered paragraphs in _MeCD_ versus 2,082 in _CMS_ 16. The _MeCD_ has one additional appendix (C), which is 22 pages with hundreds of Latin phrases explained.

The bibliography on indexing in Section 2.5 of the _MeCD_ holds quite a surprise in store. Apart from the six English-language titles listed in the same section of _CMS_ 16 (Section 2.5), there are four Spanish titles by Isidoro [Gil-Leiva (2008)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#core-R6), José Antonio [Moreiro González (2004)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#core-R8), María [Pinto Molina et al. (2002)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#core-R12), and Blanca [Rodríguez Bravo (2011)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#core-R15). Three of these books are published by Trea. The most comprehensive one, the 400+-page book by Gil-Leiva, a professor at the Univeristy of Murcia, is a general textbook on indexing; it does not focus on book indexing. Pinto Molina’s book is about indexing electronic documents.

During the process of adaptation many examples in _MeCD_ were replaced by Spanish ones. The same is true for figures; for example, proofreaders’ marks and sample text are translated into Spanish (paragraph 2.116). Naturally, in some chapters specific aspects of the Spanish language are covered: for example, the difference between the verbs _ser_ and _estar_ (paragraph 5.74), the position of adjectives (paragraph 5.44), or rules on accents (paragraphs 7.67–76). Also, Latin American context has been taken into account.

## Chapter 16 (Índices/Indexes)

Chapter 16 (Índices) was translated by Natalia Pérez Ramos, supervised by no less than three editors. Except for the adaptation of examples, this chapter is a strict translation and in this regard an excellent one. It consists of 145 paragraphs in both _CMS_ 16 and _MeCD_, with about two more pages in the latter (a total of 52 pages). For comparison, the main headings of the table of contents of Capítulo/Chapter 16 of the _MeCD_ and the _CMS_ 16 are listed in [Table 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#T2).

Technical terms and their subtle differences in meaning were taken into account. Thus, for example, terms like _entries_ and _headings_ are distinguished by being translated into their Spanish equivalents _entradas_ and _encabezados_; likewise _subentradas_ and _subencabezados._ A heading is the wording of an entry, while an entry consists of the heading, locators, and _see also_ cross-references (if any); see also, for example, [Mulvany (2005](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#core-R10): 17–18).

Nevertheless, in the section on alphabetizing (paragraphs 16.56 onwards), the users of _MeCD_ might have liked to see some explicit Spanish adaptation here. Even though the terms in the comparison list of letter-by-letter versus word-byword order (paragraph 16.61) are completely replaced by Spanish ones, there is no discussion of the idiosyncrasies of the Spanish alphabet (although, admittedly, from a Spanish perspective there simply are no idiosyncrasies). Traditionally, the letter combinations ‘ch’ (pronounced as in ‘Chicago’) and ‘ll’ (double-l pronounced as the English ‘y’ in ‘yes’) had their own sections in the Spanish alphabet right after the letters C and L respectively. In pre-twenty-first-century dictionaries, for example, this can still be seen. But around the turn of the century this practice was abolished in favour of regular alphabetical order ([Ritter, 2002](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#core-R14): 355; _Chicago Manual of Style_, 2003: para. 10.81; [Cronshaw, 2008](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#core-R5): 53). However, there are 27 letters in the Spanish alphabet, the 15th being the unique Ñ/ñ (N/n with a tilde, pronounced as the ‘ni’ in ‘onion’ or the ‘ny’ in ‘Sonya’) dating back to the twelfth century; it ‘is used in more than 15,700 words’, and Spaniards are ready to defend it, as was the case when the European Economic Community tried to eliminate it in the 1990s ([Lopéz, 2021](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#core-R7)). Outside the Spanish-speaking world this is treated like a diacritic and thus sorted like its base letter, but in Spanish it is a distinct letter of its own and sorted right after N/n in indexes and dictionaries, even within words. Using dedicated indexing software this can be easily done by force-sorting Ñ/ñ with the help of a macro; the ‘ñ’ would be sorted, for example, like ‘nzz’, a letter combination which is unlikely to appear in any Spanish words and which would follow any ‘n’.

Spanish diacritics include all vowels with accents (Á, á, É, é, etc.) as well as the diaeresis ‘ü’ and are sorted as their base letters (e.g. _ungir, ungüento, ungulado_), except in the case of homophones (e.g. _el, él_), when the base letter takes precedence over the diacritic (examples from _PONS_, 2002).

Another lack of adaptation shows the location of the paragraph on indexing Spanish names (16.84) under the section on foreign personal names. This is due to the strict translation but is rather strange from a Spanish reader’s point of view. It is also incorrectly sorted. While in _CMS_ 16 paragraphs 16.83–5 show a correct alphabetical order – Portuguese, Spanish, Thai names – the order of the same paragraphs in _MeCD_ – _antropónimos portugueses, españoles, tailandeses_ – is a victim of strict translation.

The four Spanish titles listed in the bibliography in Section 2.5 of the _MeCD_ (mentioned above) are also mentioned under resources for indexers in paragraph 16.8.

## The indexes to the _MeCD_ and _CMS_ 16 compared

While the indexers of _The Chicago Manual of Style_ are mentioned in the acknowledgements (Margie Towery in the 15th (2003) and 16th (2010) editions; Do Mi Stauber in the 17th (2017) edition), the indexer of the _MeCD_ remains a secret. In his preface, Javier Torres Ripa says, ‘El libro concluye con un completo índice de materias que remite al apartado donde se expone cada una’ (‘The book concludes with a complete subject index that refers to the paragraph/section where each subject is discussed’). Despite the fact that all the other people involved in each chapter and appendix are meticulously referred to in the _Agradecimientos_ (Acknowledgements), the indexer is not included.

The index in the _MeCD_ is called ‘Índice de marterias’ (Subject index) and has a length of 34 pages. In total, the _MeCD_ has 826 indexable pages. This accounts for an index of 4.1 per cent. In contrast, the index of the _CMS_ 16 has a length of 102 pages. Based on the 876 indexable pages in the _CMS_ 16, this means the index is a whopping 11.6 per cent, which is almost three times the size of the Spanish index. The larger index in the _CMS_ 16 is appropriate for a big handbook with myriad details, so this huge discrepancy in index length is disappointing.

There are other differences between the indexes. For example, Appendix A (Producción y tecnología digital/Production and Digital Technology) and Appendix B (Glosario/Glossary) are indexed in _CMS_ 16, the latter one by using page numbers as locators; however, Appendix B is not indexed in the _MeCD._

Like its American counterpart the Spanish index has two subentry levels, the first being indented and the second run-on. There are cross-references but far too few for an index to a handbook like this (for more on this see below). The main locators are also chapter/paragraph numbers along with some figure numbers. The so-called ‘Chicago comma’ before the first locator is used, too.

Ranges are rare in the index; in fact, many subentries have just one locator. Interestingly, it is Spanish practice, as explained in paragraphs 6.74 and 16.100, to use the _guion_ (hyphen) as a concatenator in ranges – i.e. 135-42 – instead of the en dash in English-language indexes.

The numbered paragraphs are the indexed locations in the book. The combined chapter/paragraph numbers are shown in the margin of the book and instantly catch the eye (they are called ‘números de parágrafos’ in the index headnote). If we take the total of paragraph numbers (see [Table 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#T1)) and divide it by the number of indexable pages, we get about 2.33 numbered paragraphs per indexable page on average in both the _MeCD_ and the _CMS_ 16. A numbered paragraph can be more than one paragraph of text, and may be even longer than one page, but it is often much less than a page, and thus more granular, its number being more useful as a locator.

As for expressing main headings in plural form, the index to the _MeCD_ is somewhat inconsistent. On the one hand, there are entries like ‘diálogos’, ‘ilustraciones’, ‘listas’, ‘nombres’ (names), and ‘publicaciones’; on the other ‘abreviación’, ‘bibliografía’, ‘índice’, ‘preposición’, ‘revista’ (journal), and ‘tabla’ (table), which should be put into plural form as well.

A big disadvantage of the index to the _MeCD_ is the lack of (_continued_) lines at the top of columns that indicate when entries continue from the previous column. This makes it difficult to navigate within the index, even though the _MeCD_, like the _CMS_ 16, recommends the use of such lines in paragraph 16.139. This is especially true for pages 926–9 in the _MeCD_ index (main entry ‘bibliografía’, extending over more than three and a half index pages), 930–1 (main entry ‘citas’ (quotations), over two pages), 939–40 (main entries ‘idiomas extranjeros’ (foreign languages), over two pages), and 942–3 (main entry ‘índice’, two and a half pages), where index users easily become lost because it is not clear which index level is shown. There is one monstrous subheading ‘citas autor-año’ (author-date reference system), with numerous sub-subentries spanning one index page (931). The corresponding entry in _CMS_ 16 is a main entry of its own of about half the length.

And there are a few glitches. For example, there is no blank line between the U and V entries. This probably happened because the respective column would otherwise end with the first V entry and it is good typesetting practice to avoid such orphan entries at the end of a column. Even so, there should have been a different solution to justify both columns on this index page. And some of the alphabet sections in the index are very small. While there are no K entries and just the entry ‘web’ under W (these letters are mainly used in Spanish for foreign words), it is suspicious that there are only three H entries and two J entries, which are by no means uncommon letters in Spanish. Even the B section consists of just four entries, although they extend over three and a half index pages due to the enormous entry ‘bibliografía’.

As for alphabetizing, the only two main entries beginning with ‘ll’ are sorted regularly among the L entries: that is, not following the old practice mentioned above. There are a number of main entries (see, for example, ‘coma’ (comma)) with subheadings beginning with the definite articles _el, la_, and _los_, as well as prepositions like _antes_ (after), _con_ (with), _en_ (in), _entre_ (between), _para_ (for), and _y_ (and). These are not ignored in sorting, as is done in the _CMS_ 16 index, even though paragraph 16.68 in the _MeCD_ recommends ignoring them. It might be an indication that no dedicated indexing software was used in preparing the index to _MeCD._

At least six and a half empty pages following the index are a waste of space. But these alone would not make up the difference in index length shown above. In any case, the Spanish index should be much larger to accommodate the richness of the _MeCD_.

### _Comparison of the_ ‘ilustraciones’ _and_ ‘illustrations’ _entries_

The randomly chosen main entry ‘ilustraciones’ has 21 subentries including ten sub-subentries with a total of 35 locators with almost no overlap, spanning about one column. The same entry in _CMS_ 16 (‘illustrations’) has 23 subentries, including 58 sub-subentries with a total of 117 locators with some minimal overlap, taking almost twice as much space by extending over almost two columns. There are also six _see also_ cross-references, which are missing in the Spanish entry.

Obviously, there is considerably more depth of indexing for the entry in _CMS_ 16, despite the fact that Chapter 3 (which covers illustrations and tables) is the same length in both books (about 45 pages and 85 numbered paragraphs).

There is quite a number of different indexing mistakes in the ‘ilustraciones’ entry, the most striking being the repetition of the main heading in no less than 11 subheadings, for example (indents and line breaks are as shown in the original):

> ilustraciones, 1.37, 1.99, 2.23, 2.112
> 
> comprobación de las ilustraciones,
> 
> 2.63
> 
> …
> 
> lista de ilustraciones: acorta la extensión
> 
> de los pies de foto, 3.39;
> 
> lista de ilustraciones de una
> 
> galería, 3.38, fig. 1.6
> 
> numeración de ilustraciones, 2.25
> 
> …
> 
> reproducción de ilustraciones, 2.44
> 
> tipos de ilustraciones y sus partes,
> 
> 3.3
> 
> …

Note that the main heading is even repeated in one of the sub-subheadings. These repetitions are annoying, making reading the headings more difficult, and needlessly taking up a lot of space, along with articles like las, _los_, and _una._ On top of that, many subheadings are copied as a whole or in part from the paragraph titles themselves, often further extending the length of subentries. For example, the subheading ‘imágenes de tono continuo e imágenes tramadas (medios tonos)’ is the complete title of the respective paragraph (3.3) and feels like an eternity to read.

There are only two subheadings, ‘créditos’ and ‘definición’, without the repetition of the main heading ‘ilustraciones’. The readability of this entry could have been much enhanced if this mistake had been avoided by keeping the subheadings compact and neat:

> ilustraciones, 1.37, 1.99, 2.23, 2.112
> 
> comprobación, 2.63
> 
> créditos: …
> 
> definición, 3.1
> 
> …
> 
> lista: …
> 
> numeración, 2.25
> 
> …
> 
> reproducción, 2.44
> 
> tipos y partes, 3.3
> 
> …

Without doubt, Spanish-language index users would understand these compact subheadings and thus benefit from much easier wording. For comparison, this is the ‘illustrations’ entry in _CMS_ 16:

> illustrations, 3.3–45
> 
> …
> 
> definition, 3.1
> 
> …
> 
> manuscripts and editorial concerns: …
> 
> numbering: …
> 
> …
> 
> parts, identification of, 3.12, 3.24, fig. 3.7
> 
> …
> 
> reproduction of: …
> 
> …
> 
> types: …
> 
> _See also_ … credits and credit lines; lists of illustrations and tables; …

Another mistake in this Spanish main entry is four ‘numeración’ subentries which should be unified. One of these is even sorted in the wrong place (maybe the failed attempt of a last-minute manual tweak?).

An even more serious mistake would be the omission of indexing some content about illustrations. As Do Mi Stauber put it in her famous first rule, ‘Each entry must be complete’, or, ‘If you’re picking it up, pick it up’ ([Stauber, 2004](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#core-R16): 116). At first sight the locators 3.15–20 dealing with ‘material gráfico’ (artwork) and 3.21–7 dealing with ‘pies de ilustración’ (captions) seem to be missing under ‘ilustraciones’. However, the reviewer later found the main entries ‘material gráfico’ with five subheadings and ‘pie de ilustración’ with seven subheadings, so these parts were indexed after all. What is missing here is the correct technique of connecting these entries by a _see also_ crossreference from ‘ilustraciones’ to both of these more specific entries. Even so, there are obviously other locators missing. A quick look at the locators of the corresponding entry ‘illustrations’ shows that while the subject is mainly covered in Chapter 3, locators from Chapters 4, 8, 14, and 16 are not indexed under ‘ilustraciones’.

As for the four undifferentiated locators after the main heading ‘ilustraciones’, 1.37 should read 1.38, which belongs to the subheading ‘lista’. And 1.99 is not correct either; instead, 1.100 covers illustrations in journal articles and should be an additional subheading. Also, 2.23 should be another subheading, as it deals with separate files for illustrations. Finally, 2.112 belongs to the subheading ‘comprobación’ (checking). There is really no need for these kinds of undifferentiated locators after the main heading. The exception would be to indicate the main discussion about illustrations by a locator range (3.3–45), as was done in this entry in _CMS_ 16.

Checking whether the subheadings of ‘ilustraciones’ are correctly flipped to the corresponding main headings shows another poor result. Although the subheading ‘comprobación’ with its locator 2.63 (which should have 2.112 as well) has a corresponding main heading ‘comprobación’ and subheading ‘ilustraciones’, there are incomplete flips like the subheading ‘lista’ (the corresponding subheading ‘ilustraciones’ under the main heading ‘listas’ has completely different locators, thus resulting in the serious mistake of information scattering) or no flips at all, like the subheading ‘créditos’ (crediting).

As stated above, the main entry ‘illustrations’ in _CMS_ 16 is more comprehensive. It is also flawless. There is no repetition of the main heading, nor are there several identical subheadings or undifferentiated locators. The wording of subheadings is neat and tidy. There are _see also_ cross-references to more specific and related entries. No missing flips of subheadings could be found either. The subheading ‘galleries’ has a corresponding main heading with sub-subentries turned to subentries including all locators. Perfect flips can be seen of subheadings like ‘pagination’, ‘symbols’, ‘tables’, and ‘fair use’. The subheading ‘documentation’ is not flipped, but under the main heading ‘documentation’ there is a general cross-reference ‘_See also specific items to document_ (e.g., books; newspapers)’. Subheadings like ‘definition’, ‘examples’, and ‘types’ are not flipped, as they do not suit as main headings.

### A look at some other entries

Are the indexing mistakes to be found under ‘ilustraciones’ limited to this entry? Unfortunately, this is not the case when having a closer look at some other entries in the _MeCD._

The repetition of the main heading in its subheadings occurs throughout the _MeCD_ index. For example, in ten out of ten subheadings of the main entry ‘listas’ the main heading is repeated; nine are even put to the fore of those subheadings. The same is true for the main entry ‘nombres’, with 21 repetitions on the subheading level, or the main entry ‘edición’, with 13 out of 16 subheadings, almost all being put to the fore. Other extreme examples are the entries ‘conjunción’, ‘marcado’, and ‘notas’. To be fair, there are also some entries where this mistake is well avoided, for example, ‘coma’ and ‘dos puntos’ (colon).

The important technique of flipping main and subheadings is often missing or incomplete throughout the index. In contrast, all kinds of flips were employed in the index to the _CMS_ 16, including direct ones as well as indirect ones. For example, indirect flips such as these were used:

> apostrophes
> 
> in foreign languages: German, 11.43
> 
> German language
> 
> punctuation, 11.43–44

The flipped locator is included in a range and ‘apostrophes’ is subsumed in the broader term ‘punctuation’.

### Cross-references

As mentioned before, there is a huge lack of cross-references in the _MeCD_ index. The Spanish cross-reference words _véase_ and _véase también_ are italicized in indexes, as are their English equivalents _see_ and _see also._ This reviewer could not find any _véase_ cross-references, which is very regrettable. These are important for referring, among other things, from synonyms, from abbreviations to full forms or vice versa, and to entries consisting of two equal elements, like ‘debates y entrevistas’ (discussions and interviews):

> entrevistas. _Véase_ debates y entrevistas

Or alternatively as a double entry, since this example is a simple entry with just one locator:

> debates y entrevistas, 13.46
> 
> entrevistas y debates, 13.46

There are some _véase también_ cross-references but far too few. For example, the main entry ‘puntuación’ should have _see also_ cross-references to specific punctuation entries like ‘coma’ and ‘dos puntos’. The corresponding entry in the index to _CMS_ 16 has no less than 15 _see also_ cross-references to more specific entries.

More cross-references are needed when we consider typical aspects of Romance languages, such as the reverse order of compound terms that reflect a different kind of thinking. For names and abbreviations of organizations and countries like the Organización de las Naciones Unidas (ONU) (UN) or the Cruz Roja (Red Cross), or for acronyms like OTAN (NATO) or Estados Unidos (United States) and its abbreviation EE. UU. (US – the double letters indicate plural), it is not necessary to include them in reverse order because Spanish-speaking people know these organizations by their Spanish names as given. However, it does become necessary to include them both ways if both Spanish and English names/abbreviations of the same organization are mixed up in an index ([Cronshaw, 2008](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#core-R5): 53). For example, in the _MeCD_ index there are three synonymous entries ‘International Organization for Standardization’, ‘ISO’, and ‘Organización Internacional de Normalización (International Organization for Standardization, ISO)’ with different locators. There should be one entry only with all locators gathered, and _see_ cross-references from the alternatives to that entry, for example:

> International Organization for Standardization. _Véase_ Organización Internacional de Normalización
> 
> ISO. _Véase_ Organización Internacional de Normalización
> 
> Organización Internacional de Normalización (ISO), … \[locators\]

The question of how to deal with Spanish compounds becomes even more serious when there are adjective-noun compounds which are not proper names ([Cronshaw, 2008](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#core-R5): 54). This is especially true if one element is of a rather vague nature, like ‘system’ in ‘nervous system’. Here the modifying adjective makes it specific enough to give this compound enough meaning. No one in their right mind would add a _see_ cross-reference from ‘system’ to ‘nervous system’ in an English-language index. However, in Spanish the corresponding entry would be ‘sistema nervioso’, the modifying element being put at the end. Here a _see_ cross-reference from ‘nervios’ would call an index user’s attention to an entry called ‘sistema nervioso’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> Thus there are cases where a cross-reference makes perfect sense in Spanish but does not make sense in English.

In the _MeCD_ index there are entries such as ‘idiomas extranjeros’, ‘expresiones matemáticas’, ‘propiedad intelectual’ (intellectual property), ‘ritos religiosos’, ‘términos militares’, and ‘términos religiosos’. Most of them should be controlled by _see_ cross-references, for example:

> matemáticas. _Véase_ expresiones matemáticas
> 
> militar. _Véase_ términos militares
> 
> religión. _Véase_ ritos religiosos; términos religiosos

Why is there no cross-reference from ‘idiomas extranjeros’ or ‘propiedad intelectual’? Probably because it would not make much sense to refer from ‘intelectuales’ to ‘propiedad intelectual’. So some common sense and enough feel for the Spanish language are called for when deciding when to cross-refer to entries consisting of a compound term.

Of course, if there were an entry like ‘matemáticas’ with locators, the crossreference would become _véase también._ And there is such a case in the _MeCD_ index that perfectly demonstrates this scenario by referring to a more specific entry:

> compuestos
> 
> …
> 
> _Véase también_ palabras compuestas

But the entry ‘matemáticas’ is missing. There is ‘música’ and the question is: why are there no entries for other subject areas? There is an entry for ‘remisiones’ (crossreferences), but no cross-reference from the missing synonym ‘referencias cruzadas’, and its locators do not cover the chapter on indexes.

### Classified subheadings

There are no entries for other index-specific topics like ‘entradas’, ‘subentradas’, or ‘encabezados’. Or are there? Well, not as main entries. Here we are facing another serious flaw in this index: the classified order of subheadings. An example is the entry ‘idiomas extranjeros, específico’ (foreign languages, specific), with individual languages as subentries. Of course, this arrangement is possible and not at all wrong per se, but if it is done, all of these languages have to be posted as main entries as well. This is true for all subentries which constitute a specific concept of their own (see the technique of flipping main and subheadings as explained in context of the ‘ilustraciones’ entry), including this scenario where there is a hierarchical relationship between a main heading and its subheadings. All individual languages are narrower terms of ‘idiomas extranjeros’, but none of them can be found as main entries. The right technique this time would be to half-flip them: if a narrower term becomes a main heading (e.g. ‘italiano’), its broader term (here ‘idiomas extranjeros’) must not become a subheading, as it would make no sense at all. So the classified order itself is not the mistake but the missing half-flips is.

It is very important that all concepts discussed in a book can be instantly found in an index. This can only be ensured if all concepts are put on the main heading level and not hidden as subheadings under other main headings instead. There is wisdom from the field of information architecture: ‘You can’t use what you can’t find’ ([Morville, 2005](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#core-R9): 111). And an index just consisting of classified ordered subentries would indeed be unusable.

Another problem in this entry is the combination of two equal elements in one subheading like ‘chino y japonés’ (Chinese and Japanese). While this might be acceptable in a relatively small entry, the latter element can be easily overlooked when browsing the subheadings of a large entry like ‘idiomas extranjeros, específico’. Moreover, the locators of the subentries of this entry only cover Chapter 11, even though there are plenty of other chapters dealing with foreign languages (for example, names in Chapters 8 and 16). There are two main entries, ‘idiomas extranjeros, general’ and ‘idiomas extranjeros, específico’, which seem to be force-sorted; it is understandable that the general entry precedes the specific one. Apart from the major flaw of incomplete locators this is good indexing technique, if not for the missing languages as main entries. There are three corresponding main entries in _CMS_ 16: ‘foreign-language materials’, ‘foreign-language names’, and ‘foreign words and phrases’. In the first one a classified order of languages was avoided completely; instead, there is a general cross-reference, ‘_See also individual languages_’, giving index users a general hint to look up specific language entries. The second main entry, ‘foreign-language names’, does have a classified order of languages on the sub-subentry level, but all those locators are given under the respective main entries of each language as well. Some other large main entries in the _MeCD_ index have a classified order of subentries without their half-flips: for example, ‘abreviación, especifica’, ‘bibliografía’, ‘índice’, ‘nombres’, ‘terminología científica’ (scientific terminology), where subject areas such as ‘astronomía’, ‘geografía’, ‘medicina’, specific languages as shown above, and other specific concepts are hidden.

### Other good techniques and something not yet realized

But all is not lost. It is good to see that specific concepts of other areas like grammar (Chapter 5) or punctuation (Chapter 6) – for example, ‘adjetivo’, ‘preposición’, ‘verbo’, ‘coma’, ‘dos puntos’, and many others – are posted as main entries. There are also good examples of distinguishing a homonym by use of qualifiers in the two entries ‘artículo (determinado e indeterminado)’ and ‘artículo (revista)’, although both entries should be in the plural. Also on the plus side, no incorrect sorting of main headings could be detected. It is good to see entries within quotation marks like «ídem» and «op. cit.» correctly sorted by ignoring the opening quotation mark. (Note that Spanish always uses guillemets as quotation marks.)

Apart from the full version of _CMS_, the University of Chicago Press also publishes the chapter on indexes as a booklet, including its own index. This is quite easily done by extracting entries just pertaining to this chapter from the main index. The chapter/paragraph numbers are helpful in this process, too. Of course, cross-references belonging to this chapter must not be forgotten either. But since indexing of Chapter 16 in _MeCD_ is incomplete, largely due to the classified order of subentries, such a booklet in Spanish would currently not be possible.

## Conclusion

Overall the _MeCD_ is an excellent Spanish-language reference work on all publishing areas. It may be potentially as influential in the Spanish-language world as is _CMS_ in North America and beyond. The translation and adaptation are well done (kudos to the editor and all who were involved) and the size of the _MeCD_ is similar to its American counterpart. The University of Deusto deserves full praise for being first to publish the _CMS_ in another language.

Unfortunately, the quality of the index is not up to the standard of the rest of the book because of various shortcomings. Major flaws are the missing or inconsistently applied technique of flipping main headings and subheadings, as well as the closely related classified order of subheadings without their half-flips. Other major flaws are the lack of (_continued_) lines at the top of columns, numerous repetitions of main headings in subheadings, and the lack of cross-references. However, as can be seen in a number of entries with some of these techniques correctly applied, there is no excuse that it cannot be done in Spanish indexes as well. Even so, these entries and a few cases of other good indexing techniques cannot compensate for the major flaws.

We can only speculate about the reasons for these shortcomings, but perhaps it is the lack of experience in indexing such large and complex manuals and/or the lack of a good indexing tool.

But one also has to take into account that traditionally many books in Spain (as in France) have no index at all, but a more detailed table of contents called an ‘index’ (!) instead. It is even common practice to also have a table of contents at the beginning of each chapter ([Cronshaw, 2007](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#core-R4): C3, 5). Maybe the index to the _MeCD_ to some extent still reflects this way of thinking, as can be seen by the classified order of subheadings.

Translating indexes should generally be avoided because usually page numbers would have to be adapted and different synonyms and cross-references considered as well. Some entries may even not be translatable. This is also true for Spanish-to-English translations, especially if a good translation takes cultural differences into account ([Cronshaw, 2008](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#core-R5): 54–5). However, the _MeCD_ and _CMS_ 16 are well-structured books that use paragraph numbers as locators, and these are not affected by any page breaks. So the interesting question arises whether index entries to chapters with an equal number of paragraphs at least could have been based on the respective entries in the _CMS_ 16 index. But again, a good tool like dedicated indexing software would be necessary to try this path. Access to the English index and a locator-ordered view of entries would also be essential.

As for index length, even though repeating main headings in subheadings considerably lengthens index entries, missing or incomplete flips of main entries and subheadings, the classified order of subheadings, and the lack of cross-references are major factors in substantially contributing to the much smaller number of main headings in the _MeCD_ index compared to _CMS_ 16, and thus the large discrepancy in index length.

As for indexing techniques in Spanish-language indexes in general, all can be applied correctly, as in English-language indexes. Two idiosyncrasies of the Spanish language do not pose a real challenge when it comes to indexing: (1) by force-sorting the distinct letter Ñ/ñ it would always follow the regular N/n, and (2) compound terms can be handled by additional cross-references.

Bigger challenges include indexing Spanish names ([Cronshaw, 2007](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#core-R4)); the elegant wording of headings, which ‘is more difficult to achieve’ than in English; and the large number of words for the same concept in different Spanish-speaking countries ([Perlman, 2006](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.37#core-R11): 93). The latter two aspects call for a good command of the Spanish language.
