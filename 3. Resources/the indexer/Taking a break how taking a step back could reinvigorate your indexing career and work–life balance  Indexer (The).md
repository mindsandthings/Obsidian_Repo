## Abstract

Freelance indexers, usually working from home, have a responsibility not only to run their businesses efficiently but also to take care of their physical and mental health. For any number of reasons they may at some point be forced to take a break from indexing. The latest in our series of occasional articles focusing on the working lives of individual indexers looks at how one indexer dealt with the challenges this posed and explains how taking a break and reassessing priorities can help to both reinvigorate one’s career and improve well-being. It concludes with some reflections on the implications of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, living and working under lockdown, and the ‘new normal’.

> Why do you go away? So that you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colours. And the people there see you differently, too. Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving.

## Introduction

During the 2019 Society of Indexers (SI) conference in London, I attended an excellent workshop on time management led by Tanya Izzard (see Kingdom, [2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.28#core-R3): 105). Towards the end of the afternoon, after a general chat amongst the group about work–life balance, Tanya asked, ‘Has anyone taken time off?’ ‘Yes, me’, I replied … ‘and it was the best thing I could have done’. It was suggested that I might share my experience through the pages of _The Indexer_, so that other indexers might benefit from learning about how one indexer dealt with a family crisis and why taking a break can prove to be so beneficial. Mulling this idea over, I found myself inspired by the conference theme – ‘Investigate, Invigorate, Innovate’, which seemed to sum up what my ‘time out’ had been about.

### Crisis management

In 2014, our younger teenage daughter developed serious mental health problems, which had a profound effect on our family and work lives. Over the next five years she needed a huge amount of support and care, especially as she needed to be tutored at home through the school’s Medical Needs Service. My office became the ‘schoolroom’, so once again I became a ‘kitchen-table worker’. As the main carer, I needed to assess how I was going to continue to work at my indexing business. Our older daughter had started university but also needed both emotional and financial support. Losing my income was not a favourable option and I did not want to lose the business I had built up, as it gave me a positive focus, intellectual fulfilment and social contact through SI local groups, through conferences and online. This really felt like crisis management.

The first step was to rearrange my working day, making good use of early mornings, evenings and weekends, when my husband could take over care duties. I decided to reassess what work I could take on, opting for longer deadlines and shorter projects. As a welcome break from working alone at home, I had been doing voluntary work at Bletchley Park and was involved with the Society of Indexers Executive Board. Unfortunately, I eventually had to give up this up as I could not commit the time both activities deserved. My fellow board members were very supportive and understanding. One of the other downsides was that I struggled to attend my local SI group meetings, and I did feel the loss of the social and professional contact.

By 2018, I was really beginning to notice the effects of ‘digging deep’, juggling my work hours and feeling ‘compassion fatigue’ – so common amongst carers. It is easy to underestimate the emotional and mental toil a loved one’s illness can have on the carer. I felt jaded, tired and concerned about my own mental and physical health too. Our older daughter had finished university and moved back home, our younger daughter’s health was much improved and I saw that taking a short break was now a viable option financially. I had struggled through my last few indexing jobs and worried that I would begin to make errors. So, before my relationship with indexing turned ‘toxic’, I took a step back and decided to block out the diary as ‘busy’ for the next six months. I did not tell any publishers that I was not working; I left myself an ‘opt-in’ clause if I felt I wanted to go back to work. I also wanted to know if I missed indexing, or whether it was time to start a new chapter doing something else.

## Investigate

I needed to make sense of the past five years and think about what the next steps would be. So I decided to do a course of counselling sessions, which were very helpful in getting some perspective and gave me somewhere to dump all my frustrations and worries. My counsellor introduced me to a Tree of Life project<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.28#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup> and the Life Compass,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.28#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup> which are useful therapeutic techniques for prioritizing the areas that need working on. I was also encouraged to create a vision board,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.28#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup> which encouraged me to think about where I wanted my future path to go. I used _Pinterest_ for this, pinning useful affirmations and ideas. A mind-map, a list or writing a journal would be equally effective. It might sound a bit ‘hippy-dippy’, but a mental pat on the back is always welcome.

As my eldest daughter was job hunting, I also spent time studying the job market for myself, but I gradually came to the conclusion that nothing else really offered the flexibility, intellectual challenge and diversity of work that indexing gave me. Being freelance had worked very well for us as a family and still continued to. So I resolved to spend some time revamping my business.

## Invigorate

### Getting my house in order …

I decided at the beginning of my break to tidy up my business administration and do any filing, so when I came back to it, everything was up to date and organized. My older daughter, fresh from completing a fashion degree and waiting to start work, happily set about redesigning and updating all my business stationery, giving it a fresh, modern look. It made me feel revamped as well and it was nice to have that support from her.

### Clear your clutter; clear your mind!

I had felt very overwhelmed by my backlog of professional reading (e.g. _The Indexer, SIdelights_, various textbooks, etc.), so I tackled that by just keeping the articles I really wanted to read and recycling the rest. I filed these away in folders, such as business of indexing, technical skills and subject areas, and gradually worked through them. Rather than tackle a whole book, I just earmarked the chapter(s) I felt would be most helpful to me. This also helped to rekindle my love of indexing, consolidating my knowledge and picking up some useful tips along the way.

## The great outdoors …

> It does good also to take walks out of doors, so that our spirits may be raised and refreshed by the open air and fresh breeze …
> 
> Seneca<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.28#fn6" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn6">6</a></sup>

There is a great deal of evidence that contact with nature can have an incredible therapeutic effect on us. The Japanese have a process of relaxation known as _shinrin yoku_ – forest bathing. We had acquired a dog at some point in my daughter’s illness as a kind of ‘therapy dog’, but Maisie also became my therapy as well as we went on long walks in the nearby woods and country parks. That still continues; if I hit a ‘wall’ when indexing, I walk Maisie and use that ‘time out’ to refresh and get my perspective back. There is also research to suggest that owning a dog may lead to a longer life.

I also spent a great deal of time sorting out our garden, enjoying the contact with nature and the physical exercise, which is a good balance to the intellectual exercise of indexing. Scientists believe there is a natural antidepressant in soil, which may stimulate serotonin production, which makes you relaxed and happier. Whether it was that – or the sun and fresh air – it certainly helped me and the garden looked a lot tidier!

Healthwise, I started reflexology, used aromatherapy and other herbal remedies, alongside antidepressant medication, as a holistic approach. I found that, in conjunction with the counselling, this approach worked for me. Having suffered back problems for a number of years, I also continued with regular Pilates classes. This helps keeps my back tuned up and loosens up all those tight muscles from sitting for too long in front of a screen. The time out to reconnect with how my body is feeling has mental benefits too. Running, swimming, yoga or simple stretching can all be very therapeutic too.

### Social media …

It is quite common to hear about the evils of social media, and it can be a huge source of negativity. But I also found having that connection with friends and family very useful. It helped me feel less socially isolated and I was able to share my worries and frustrations with a couple of very close friends. It also gave me a much-needed good laugh once in a while …

And if all this sounds like I was rushing around keeping very busy, I did also spend a great deal of time in a deckchair with a cup of tea, reading or doing my crochet or knitting. (I got a lot of blankets made for friends and relatives.) The repetitive actions associated with handicrafts have been shown to release serotonin, a natural anti-depressant – and you don’t have to be ‘old and grey’ to knit. Young and old, male and female can benefit from getting some wool and needles out (or indeed any craft).

I have also found a lot of support in my local ‘Knit & Natter’ groups – we meet at pubs, the local library or a coffee shop. It gives me social time outside indexing and a chance to reconnect with people from all sorts of ages and backgrounds. We craft, talk and put the world to rights. I have also educated them about the world of indexing, which luckily they find fascinating!

One of my best memories of my ‘time out’ was running a project at my local library’s Knit & Stitch Group to create a Crocheted Christmas Tree, a project that eventually involved the whole family. It was huge fun being part of a community project and was so successful that the group was interviewed by our local radio station. It was also a great opportunity to keep up my project-management and team-building skills, whilst enjoying my hobby.

## Innovate

Once I felt the urge to get back to work, I started a marketing drive to new publishers and contacting existing clients with an updated indexing resumé. Unlike someone building up an indexing business from scratch (see e.g. Millis, [2010](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.28#core-R4); [2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.28#core-R5)), I was confident that my ‘back catalogue’ was strong and that I had extensive indexing experience in a number of areas. I revamped my LinkedIn profile after attending an inspiring workshop by Ruth Ellis (SI Internet director) and updated my entry in the SI Directory of Professional Indexers. I also signed up for the 2019 conference, keen to do some workshops, and reconnected with my local SI group. I also linked up with the local group of the Society for Editors and Proofreaders (now the Chartered Institute of Editing and Proofreading) and attended one of their meetings. Luckily, I have now been working steadily, have picked up some new clients and am getting a good rate of pay.

On a voluntary basis, I offered to index the annual _Transactions_ of our local history society. That has helped on a number of levels: I gained a rich understanding of the history of the community I live in, kept my ‘indexing brain’ tuned up between paid commissions and got a lot of personal satisfaction from the project. I am also working on a group project to transcribe the Victorian school logs for a local primary school that began life as a National School; the entries I am working on are sad, funny and fascinating in turn. And I am in the process of setting up a book club, meeting once a month at our local country park – a chance to socialize with like-minded people in a beautiful setting.

Most important of all, I have learnt to take time out. I am more aware of listening to myself for warning signs of overload. The odd ‘duvet day’ or ‘mental health’ day has become very important to me, and I can return to my desk feeling restored and in a better frame of mind.

## Conclusion

Taking a break was the right thing for me to do, and was made easier through the support of family and friends. If taking a block of time out is not a viable option, I would still urge you to do the following if you are feeling jaded, tired and overwhelmed.

### What worked for me …

•

Have one day a week that is down-time – have a complete break from work.

•

Book regular annual holidays into your year. If this is not possible, have a ‘staycation’ and visit local attractions.

•

Eat well – resist ‘comfort eating’ or skipping meals.

•

Drink plenty of water and other fluids.

•

Connect with the outdoors and nature – even if you just take a tea break in the garden. Visit your library or local well-being service to ask about organized ‘health walks’.

•

Find opportunities to get involved with your local community. People can be very understanding and supportive.

•

Stress, anxiety, isolation and loneliness are debilitating, so do not be afraid to ask for help. Talk to someone – friend, relative, fellow indexer or counsellor.

•

Think about balance – it is so important to guard your mental and physical health. Think of it as an investment in your indexing business.

•

Connect with your local/regional indexing group – they are in a good place to understand the stresses and worries of an indexer’s life.

•

Get a dog, offer to walk/dog-sit a neighbour’s/friend’s dog for them or volunteer as a dog walker at a rescue shelter. A dog or cat, or any other pet, is good company if you live/spend part of your day alone.

•

Do a practical craft or hobby – this can trigger different working parts of your brain … and could have a positive effect on your indexing

•

Cultivate a sense of humour …

## Postscript

> One day this will all be over. And we will be grateful for life in ways we never felt possible before.

> Matt Haig<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.28#fn8" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn8">8</a></sup>

I started writing this article at the beginning of 2020 and could not have envisaged that we would now all be in the strange situation of being socially isolated and, for many, becoming carers for sick loved ones due to COVID-19 and lockdown. Social distancing, quarantine, shielding and #StayAtHome/#StayAlert are the buzzwords at the moment, but for many people this means the pain of being unable to be with loved ones, losing loved ones and being on furlough with reduced earnings, and many vulnerable families and individuals are struggling to cope. Working practices have had to rapidly adapt, with homeworking and homeschooling becoming the ‘new normal’. These events will have a huge impact on our lives, economically, emotionally and psychologically, for years to come.

Writing from the UK, I am aware that there are indexers around the world who have been in lockdown for longer. Coping with enforced isolation has come as a shock to many, and it certainly took me a while to feel on a steady footing again. Even more so as I felt I was beginning to be able to get back out into the world again after my period of time caring for my daughter.

Like the families of many home-based freelancers, we found ourselves faced with a number of challenges: how to organize our household, how to give each person both ‘work’ and ‘relaxation’ space, and dealing with basics like shopping for food and ensuring vulnerable relatives were safe and provided for. At times we all found ourselves going through a range of emotions, sleeping a lot, feeling drained, unmotivated and overwhelmed by news and social media. Eventually we settled into a routine, accepting the ‘new normal’ as our way of life for the present. Everyone had found their space and how they were going to deal with lockdown. It was tough, being cut off from our usual ‘nature’ spaces that we used to drive to with our dog, but luckily we have fields and woods to walk to from the house. The ‘hour of exercise’ became a ‘sanity hour’ to reconnect with the outside world, waving at familiar faces from a distance.

I had finished an index just before lockdown, but then found myself with no work after that. I contacted some publishers, but there was nothing available at that moment. I decided to keep myself busy doing my voluntary indexing work for the local history society until something turned up. I did check up on the forums on the SI website and kept in contact with our local group. Eventually, at the beginning of June, I had two pieces of work land in my inbox on the same day and that kept me busy until the end of the month.

It seemed important to spend a great deal of time keeping in contact with family and friends via Skype, Zoom and Demio. My local Knit & Natter groups went digital, so although my friends and I were physically isolated, we didn’t feel emotionally isolated and were able to give a great deal of support to each other. Our house is on the junction of two cul-de-sacs so we feel that we have our own little community here, and it made sense to form a community hub Facebook group. This worked well, keeping in touch with each other and helping out with any needs. We have a number of key workers living here, so the ‘Thursday night clap’ became very personal. Some of our older residents felt much supported as others did shopping and small jobs for them. One of my neighbours who had a leaking water tap was delighted to discover another neighbour who is now a teacher was, in a former life, a qualified plumber! It is amazing the life skills that become so important in times of crisis.

> One of the extraordinary features of the response to COVID-19 is that, during this self-isolation, some people – especially elderly people – feel less isolated than they have done for years, as their neighbours ensure they are not alone. (Monbiot, [2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.28#core-R6))

As always, doing craft has proved therapeutic for all the family. I crocheted two ‘Rainbows of Unity’ to put on the front door and side window, to cheer up the postman and neighbours. My younger daughter and I also volunteered to help sew scrubs bags and headbands for the NHS, which helped us to feel that we were helping to make a difference in some small way. We even got my husband to do some machine stitching too!

And while people worked hard at being in lockdown and trying to make it into a positive time and a time of respite from a hectic world, it was also important to acknowledge that this has been new territory for all of us and has been a rollercoaster of emotions. I had days when I felt focused and determined to get through this crisis. I also had days when I felt angry, tired or sad – all natural reactions to this strange situation we find ourselves in. What made this ‘enforced isolation’ different to my previous period of ‘isolation’ with my daughter is that as a family we are now all older and wiser. We have learnt how to deal with triggers to poor mental health and how to put things in place to help with recovery. We are kinder to ourselves and accept that at times it is OK not to be OK. Also, having a strong community around us and a shared grief lessened that sense of isolation. Whilst times are tough and uncertain, we know that with patience, understanding and fortitude, this too will pass and life will get better. I wish all indexers and their families, wherever you are in the world, health and happiness, and look forward to better days as we adjust to life in the ‘new normal’, whatever that may prove to be.

> If you’re tapping into fresh reservoirs of strength and inspiration, celebrate that. You can use your energy to help others, too. But if you’re really struggling as you watch it all unfold, feeling fear as this thing marches closer, or mourning your own real losses, that’s a normal reaction.
