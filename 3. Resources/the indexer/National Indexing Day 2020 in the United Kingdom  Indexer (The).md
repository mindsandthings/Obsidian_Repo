## Abstract

On National Indexing Day (#indexday), now seen as a regular event in the annual indexing calendar, the Society of Indexers expected to concentrate its efforts on an event for publishers and editors in London. However, as COVID-19 gradually put a stop to normal life, the Society had to rethink the day and come up with novel ideas to engage its target audience. This short article gives a flavour of how the day was celebrated in the online environment.

In early 2020, with COVID-19 apparently a newly identified virus that the British need not worry about, the Society of Indexers (SI) began planning a half-day event for editors and publishers for National Indexing Day ([Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.30#F1)). This was to be along similar lines to those held in 2018 and 2019 (see Ellis et al., [2018](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.30#core-R2); Kingdom, [2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.30#core-R3)), with a series of presentations on good indexing practice, how indexing software is used, and the impact of digital developments and embedded indexing. The event space at London’s Foundling Museum had been booked for 31 March, presenters began to revise their presentations and bookings began to trickle in. But as the weeks went by and the virus continued its inexorable march across the globe, it became obvious that normal life was going to be put on hold sooner or later. Organizations throughout the world began cancelling events as travelling and meeting in large groups became less and less desirable and more and more people began working from home. In early March the decision was made to cancel, the venue was rebooked for 2021, and the Society’s plans for marking the day had to be adapted to meet the new situation, by promoting indexing and indexers online.

A week after the imposition of ‘lockdown’ regulations, and with the mainstream media focusing on the developing pandemic situation, there was no chance of receiving the kind of coverage the first National Indexing Day had enjoyed in 2017, when again it had essentially been an online event (Ellis, [2017](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.30#core-R1)). However, by highlighting new material (rather than just promoting clicks to existing website pages) on the Society’s Facebook and Twitter accounts, considerable interest and interaction was generated. In addition to launching the latest SI online workshop, Indexing for Editors, on the day itself, a few days earlier a competition for amateur indexers was announced. Amongst those tweeting about it, SI president Sam Leith urged his followers,

> Use your isolation wisely! Make an index! @indexers shows the way with this competition for Tuesday’s #indexday.

The task was to index the SI booklet for editors and authors commissioning indexes, _Last But Not Least_, which was available on the website. The prize was free access to the Society’s Indexing Basics online workshop. Although there were not a great many entries by the 3 April deadline, a winner was identified and gained access to the course.

Searching for last-minute inspiration, Ruth Ellis, SI’s social media manager, who was coordinating the day, came up with the idea of a fun quiz, as a novel way of highlighting indexing and indexes. The challenge was to identify the subject of a biography from snippets of the index. Choosing suitable snippets was easier said than done. After ransacking her bookshelves, looking for biographies with reasonably decent indexes, Ruth found it quite difficult to choose sections that did not name the subject, since the subjects’ initials were widely used in sub-entries. She also had to choose subjects who were well known internationally. Five books ticked all the boxes (biographies of David Attenborough, Charles Dickens, Queen Elizabeth I, T. E. Lawrence (‘Lawrence of Arabia’) and Nelson Mandela) and the resultant quiz led to considerable interaction on social media.

As National Indexing Day dawned, the volume of posts increased. Caroline Wilding struck the first topical note:

> #indexes have never been more important … to tell the difference between Corona, virus and Corona, beer #indexday

Capitalizing on recent news items that had captured the public imagination, SI chair Nicola King regretted,

> We probably can’t make #indexday as exciting as the goats of #Llandudno

with a reference to the wild Kashmiri goats taking advantage of the lack of people and traffic to venture down from the hills of the Great Orme.

Former SI president and current CIEP president, the linguist David Crystal, pointed out the inaccuracy of the term ‘social distancing’, which

> seems totally wrong to me. It’s ‘physical distancing’ we need to be practising. We need social solidarity, not distancing, at this time

prompting Nicola King to wonder when we will start indexing the term.

Still on recent topical themes, and showing how the pandemic had dramatically changed MPs’ priorities, the House of Commons Library reminded those following #indexday that there is a team of indexers working to tight deadlines to index parliamentary proceedings and responding to changes in what is being talked about ([Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.30#F2)).

Throughout the day, official posts from the Society’s social media accounts drawing attention to the services provided by the Society were interspersed with those from indexers mentioning the wide variety of fascinating texts they were immersed in, and pointing out that #SocialDistancing and working from home (#WFH) were nothing new for freelance indexers.

SI secretary Philippa Jevons impressed her colleagues by taking up the challenge to describe her job using only the ‘ten hundred’ most-used words – not as easy as it sounds:

> My job is to help people find things in books. I read what the book will say and I write down the names of important ideas, things and people it talks about (in order of the letters that you write them with), together with the places they are at in the book. When the book is made my work goes at the back, so that people can look there to find where (or whether) it talks about the idea, thing or person that they are interested in. Sometimes it is not simple to do: the ideas can be hard to give good names to, or there can be many parts to them, or the book might talk a lot about one thing or person, and I have to think about how to help people find exactly what they need as quickly as possible.

Humour is always a great way of attracting interest; various posts highlighted unusual and intriguing index entries and amusing juxtapositions, while Philippa Jevons spotted a series of lonely ‘Q’ entries themselves practising self-isolation ([Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.30#F3))!

Humorous indexes are dear to the heart of SI’s marketing director, Paula Clarke Bain, who chose National Indexing Day to share ‘some of the best and funniest index entries I know’ on her blog, [https://baindex.org/blog/](https://baindex.org/blog/). There was even a musical interlude later in the day, with a link to ‘The indexer’s lament’ on YouTube written by a former editor of _The Indexer_, Hazel Bell. Readers were also reminded that there was another chance to hear Ruth Ellis being interviewed in 2019 for [bookcareers.com/LIVE](http://bookcareers.com/LIVE).

Contributions from outside the core indexing community included the _Literary Review_ on the joy of indexes, and the fun of reading in reverse (much appreciated from the other side of the world by Sydney University Press), York University’s Borthwick Institute on indexes to historic archives, and Royal Museums Greenwich on indexes to the Dreadnought Seamen’s Hospital admissions.

And of course this journal’s Twitter account (@The\_Indexer) was also active during the day, reminding its followers that every year Liverpool University Press makes one issue free for anyone to download and delighting the Borthwick Institute by retweeting its tweet with an appropriate index-finger emoji!

From an analysis of Facebook posts for #indexday it was obvious that the competition and the quiz were the clear winners in terms of user response and interaction, showing how vital it is to have new material for users to interact with. Similarly, as shown through Google Analytics, there was considerable additional traffic to the SI website on both 26 March (the announcement of the competition) and 31 March (National Index Day itself).
