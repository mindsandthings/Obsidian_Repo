## Abstract

The American Society for Indexing’s 2022 virtual conference focused on the future of indexing and the effect of technological changes on the publishing industry. Eight sessions were held over two days (29–30 April) and a pre-conference workshop for new indexers was offered the day before (28 April). Over 120 participants from around the world joined the conference online. The programme included presentations on practical topics (indexing the metatopic, editing an index, updating an existing index, marketing), indexing in various formats (children’s books, ebooks), and the role of indexing (both historical and in the modern world). Generous break times and a final happy hour enabled participants to chat and network informally, while for those on the other side of the world the availability of recordings of all the sessions enabled them to benefit without having to stay up half the night.

The American Society for Indexing (ASI) held their 2022 virtual conference, ‘The Future of Indexing: A Mix of Art & Technology’, on 29–30 April. It followed two successful online conferences in 2019 and 2020, and this format proved once again to be an attractive offering. Over 120 participants registered for the conference. While most were from the United States, there were a number of participants from other countries, including Australia, Canada, China, Egypt, France, Germany, India, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

Conference registration included eight sessions held over two days (29–30 April). Each session was followed by a 15-minute break and there were longer 30-minute breaks mid-programme. Although there were no break-out sessions in smaller groups, participants took the opportunity for some networking during the breaks and many also joined the happy hour at the end of the first day to chat and connect informally with colleagues. Gwen Henson (ASI executive director) and Devon Thomas (ASI past president) once again kept the programme ticking over and cheerfully introduced the speakers and moderated the Q&A sessions. It was particularly effective the way Devon Thomas interacted with several speakers in a conversational manner when they paused for questions, helping to counteract the sense of isolation associated with a virtual conference.

The event was presented live via Zoom and the sessions were all recorded. However, in order to encourage open participation, the organisers chose not to record the Q&A period at the end of each session. Registered participants were given access to the recordings for one year following the event. This was particularly helpful for participants for whom the timings were not ideal, notably those from Australia and New Zealand, but was also useful for anyone who had to dip in and out of the conference for any reason, or felt the need to watch some sessions again to gain full value from them.

The conference was bookended by optional extras. Fred Leise taught a pre-conference workshop for new indexers on 28 April that was designed for people considering a career in indexing and provided an introduction to the art and science of indexing and running an indexing business. A bonus ‘Software Segments’ programme was offered free to all conference participants on 4 May. Vendors and users were invited to mingle, share tips, and discuss updates on CINDEX™, Index-Manager, SKY Software and Macrex.

## Day one

### Index, a history of the: _a history of the index to (Paula Clarke Bain)_

In this opening session, participants were treated to a fascinating insight into the indexing of the book that has taken the publishing world by storm. As one participant commented in the Zoom chat, ‘What has been fun with this book is how non-indexing friends have all mentioned it to me, saying “ah, that’s what you do” … it has brought amazing PR for the indexing profession!’ Receiving rave reviews on both sides of the pond, Dennis Duncan’s _Index, a history of the_ propelled its indexer, Society of Indexers’ member Paula Clarke Bain, into the limelight. Appearing alongside Dennis in podcasts and interviews, Paula and her index also featured on the back-cover blurb of the American edition; this must be a first for an indexer, a far cry from our usual anonymity.

Originally conceived as an academic monograph on a niche area of interest, with a limited print run and a high price, Dennis Duncan’s book caught the attention of the trade press, achieving a much wider readership. Without sacrificing the academic content, it is written in an accessible and engaging style and Dennis wanted a serious, scholarly index that was also lively and playful, and reflected the personality of the indexer. This was certainly an unusual situation for an indexer to find herself in and Paula was the obvious choice; she had met Dennis at several indexing conferences and was well known for her interest in humorous indexes.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.22#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> She and Dennis found that they shared a similar sense of humour and knew they could work together. Paula also enjoys working directly with authors, which she had talked about at a live National Indexing Day online event earlier in the year.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.22#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup>

In addition, Dennis was also keen to demonstrate the superiority of the human indexer by including an extract from a computer-generated index to the book. Clearly showing the failings of what was effectively a concordance based on word-spotting, this inevitably came in for a number of derogatory entries in Paula’s index.

In preparing the index, Paula was very conscious that the readership would range from academics and indexers to the general public. She made two passes through the text, concentrating first on the serious, basic index and then adding the creative, humorous aspects, including some that would particularly appeal to indexers.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.22#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup> She was given an ‘amazing brief’, with free rein to ‘play’, and discussed her ideas for indexing wit with Dennis over several Zoom calls. As a crossword-setter-in-training, Paula loves wordplay and used acrostics, anagrams and word golf (_à la_ Lewis Carroll) here and there throughout the index. She was also not averse to breaking indexing ‘rules’ to make a point, especially in relation to cross-references, and was keen to ensure that the first and last index entries were memorable (‘a, a, a’ and ‘z, z, z’). Paula’s inventiveness was also on display in her presentation, with the inclusion of an index to her slides in her handout for attendees ([Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.22#F1)).

Not only did the index reflect the indexer’s personality, allowing her to interject comments (indicated by \[PCB\]), such as ‘Hi colleagues’ under Society of Indexers, but the indexer herself appeared in the index. As Paula explained, this was a very self-referential, ‘meta’ process: ‘I’m a book indexer, and I’m indexing a book about book indexes and now I’m talking to a bunch of book indexers about that’. Equally strangely, she found herself indexing the index and the index also refers to itself and to the automatically created index, entries that sadly do not work in the US version due to pagination changes in the endmatter. As Paula emphasised, do not accept the publisher’s word that no text has been moved – always check revised proofs. On a more positive note, she mentioned that in the Italian edition Chiara Baffa had done a great job of translating much of the humour.

This was a dream job for Paula, but she also confessed to suffering from imposter syndrome, concerned that she could be laying herself open to criticism by her professional colleagues. She need not have worried; numerous comments in the conference Zoom chat showed how much the audience loved the index, the book itself and Paula’s presentation, which made a great start to the conference. It very clearly demonstrated how much Paula had enjoyed preparing this index and was a great example of a successful working partnership between author and indexer. \[_Editor’s Note: See also Paula Clarke Bain’s article on pages 189–204 in this issue about working with Dennis Duncan and their conference presentations._\]

### _Where do you fit? The art of indexing in the age of automation (Joshua Tallent)_

We then leapt from the past into the future as Joshua Tallent considered the role of indexers in the modern age. Joshua’s background is deeply rooted in ebook development, metadata and other publishing technologies, and he is currently the director of sales and education at Firebrand Technologies.

The presentation started with an explanation of the modern publishing process from the initial idea for a book through to distribution and marketing. Joshua noted that print books are still in strong demand and that online book sales are predominant, particularly as an after-effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that indexers will still be in demand, but he also noted the effects of technology.

Joshua last spoke at an ASI conference in 2013, and he reflected that ebooks had not changed much since that time. However, they are ‘on the cusp’ of change and he stressed that indexers should be ready to adapt rather than trying to predict what that change will be. He suggested becoming experts in hyperlinking and embedding indexes in ebook formats and ‘preaching’ to publishers about the possibilities for doing this. He also noted the possibilities for including indexes in audiobooks using time stamps or other locators.

Looking beyond the subject index, he noted that the ability for publishers to sell books online from the backlist (over one year old) has increased and that metadata are very important for discoverability in this context. However, there are not many people who can do the keyword creation required. Joshua suggested that indexers should look beyond their current role and market their skills at understanding the concepts in a book to publishers in order to become involved in this work.

Overall, Joshua emphasised that change is inevitable, challenging indexers to ‘boldly go where no indexer has gone before’! His talk certainly inspired some discussion in the Zoom chat, with indexers asking more about metadata creation and how to explain the value of indexes to publishers. Participants also appreciated his positive outlook, particularly given the last few years of anxiety over potential loss of indexes in ebooks. Interested readers might want to tune in to Joshua’s BookSmarts Podcast to learn more about the publishing industry and his take on where it is heading.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.22#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup>

### _Marketing for freelance book indexers (John Coe)_

John Coe, president of B2B Marketing, LLC and author of _The fundamentals of business-to-business sales and marketing_ (2003), shared his experience on how solo practitioners can find, sell and grow business. Devon Thomas and Gwen Henson had briefed him on the situation, capabilities and budgets of freelance book indexers, and his talk was thus tailored specifically for this audience. John covered the four important elements of a successful marketing campaign and also uploaded a detailed marketing programme handout for participants to download from the conference website.

John’s advice for finding new business included targeting potential clients (such as editors, packagers and authors) using first-party data (gathered directly during communications with potential clients) and third-party data (using databases or lists such as LinkedIn, NextMark or Literary Marketplace). When communicating with potential clients, he advised indexers to use a blended approach of email, mail and phone. He suggested focusing on the ‘offer’, or what the person is responding for: ‘What’s-In-It-For-Me (WIIFM)’. He noted that while initial sales calls are not commonly used today, a phone call to follow up prior communication by email or mail can be useful. He offered tips on designing letters and emails, but cautioned that finding the best person to contact at a company can be difficult. Even if you know who to contact, it can take several emails or letters to get a first response. John suggested using a ‘straight-talk’ strategy that involves writing deductively. Start with the strongest benefit of the service you offer and attempt to answer whatever questions you think the client might have right at the start.

John’s advice for keeping current clients was to provide great service and a personal touch. His emphasis on ‘growing’ current clients was also interesting. As he noted, it is always easier and less expensive to generate business through current clients than to find new ones. A big part of this process is keeping them satisfied and willing to refer their colleagues to you. He explained that decisions are often emotional and that random acts of thoughtfulness and kindness can be helpful to build a good indexer–client relationship. In other words, giving a bit extra will often help you get a bit more in return. Indexers contributed some ideas for doing this in the Zoom chat, including sending holiday cards to clients or sending reviews of books to authors when they see them.

### _Laying the ground for the future: improving your index-editing process (Fred Leise)_

On the twentieth anniversary of his first ASI conference presentation, award-winning indexer Fred Leise shared his knowledge yet again as he explained the steps in his ‘simple yet exhaustive’ index-editing process. Fred has been indexing since 1995 and has a long history of involvement in the indexing community as an ASI board member, indexing course instructor and founding member of the Institute of Certified Indexers. He has also published several articles about the indexing process in _The Indexer_.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.22#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup>

Fred’s presentation was aimed at both beginners and experienced professionals. His emphasis was on using a checklist of quick steps that could be used with every index to improve its features and tighten its overall structure (see [Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.22#F2)). He advised letting the index ‘rest’ for a day before editing and then allowing plenty of time for the editing process (at least a full day for larger texts). His checklist was not sequential but combined similar tasks and assumed that multiple passes through the index would be necessary, concluding with a final read-through of the whole index. Fred provided useful examples of each step in his recommended process but also suggested that indexers find combinations of tasks that are most comfortable for them. The tasks ranged from the obvious steps of doing a spellcheck and ensuring that the index matched the required style to more involved editing of headings and subheadings.

The Zoom chat during Fred’s session was also a goldmine of advice, with many indexers offering suggestions about editing processes and checklists that they use as well as specific methods using various software.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.22#fn6" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn6">6</a></sup> The discussion extended to methods of backing up work and how printing out the index for a final review in hard copy is not only easier on the eyes but also gives the indexer a better idea of the reader’s experience.

## Day two

### _Indexing the metatopic: bridging the gap across the pond (Melanie Gee)_

The second day began with another presentation from the UK. Describing herself as a ‘metatopic muser’ on LinkedIn, Melanie Gee began by mentioning some of the sources that had influenced her thinking, in particular Do Mi Stauber’s _Facing the text_ (2004) and a number of articles in _The Indexer_, including [Towery (2017)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.22#core-R5) and [Mertes (2018)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.22#core-R3). Prior to 1997, when Stauber coined the term ‘metatopic’ to represent the subject of the whole book (in her ‘Facing the text’ workshop), it had not been discussed specifically and indexing it was generally frowned upon. As Janet Perlman noted in the Zoom chat, ‘Many years ago, before Do Mi’s book and her articulation of the concept, it was definitely never done. It was considered terrible form, historically. This is a recent development, in the history of indexing. Thanks, Do Mi!’

In recent discussions with long-experienced practitioners who had begun indexing before 1997, Melanie had learnt that it had definitely influenced their approach, and although students on the SI training course were warned about the obvious danger of adopting a classified approach and ending up with an index within an index, the course allowed that a short entry under the metatopic can be useful. Indeed, although there is serious lack of research on user behaviour, anecdotal evidence suggests that readers, especially less experienced index users, do expect to find an entry for the metatopic. Melanie also suggested that it can help to give an index coherence and may have a marketing role.

In an attempt to discover whether indexers think about the metatopic, whether they explicitly formulate it (and actually write it down), whether or not they index it, and how, Melanie had conducted short surveys of UK and US indexers and these results informed her presentation, along with reflections on her own practice. Thinking about the metatopic can help the indexer understand the structure of the text and it seems that most indexers do certainly think about it. And, from these surveys at least, there was little evidence to back up the assertion that UK indexers were much less likely to index it than those in the US. Generally it was _not_ indexed if it was felt to be too broad to be useful, or if there was no general information about it but only specific aspects, which would be indexed separately.

Respondents to Melanie’s surveys had sent her examples of metatopic indexing and she used these and some from her own indexes to illustrate types of metatopics and how indexers were approaching them. These were supplied in a useful handout for conference participants to refer to during the presentation. She began with what she thought of as a single, simple metatopic, but pointed out that indexing it might not necessarily be that simple. She briefly discussed examples of minimal treatment, fuller treatment and heading clusters, before moving on to more complex examples – multiple and multifaceted metatopics. (Some books, of course, have nebulous metatopics that cannot be indexed, or they might have no metatopic at all.) She also included several examples showing how cross-references from the metatopic to major topics play a useful role in helping readers to navigate the text, with only general aspects (such as ‘definition’) appearing under the metatopic. She felt that readers would find it helpful if qualifiers were used to confine the scope of the metatopic heading; this was corroborated by Jochen Fassbender’s comment in the Zoom chat, suggesting that one criterion for metatopic subheadings would be those that cannot be ‘flipped’ into main headings.

The metatopic can be a tricky thing to index, even for the most experienced indexer. This thought-provoking presentation certainly demonstrated that and generated lively discussion in the Zoom chat, with participants exchanging experiences about particular books and how they identified and visualised metatopics – spider-web diagrams and mind maps were popular devices. In preparation for an article in a forthcoming issue of _The Indexer_,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.22#fn7" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn7">7</a></sup> Melanie was keen for indexers to contact her with their own thoughts on the metatopic, and in particular whether they felt that the idea of multifaceted metatopics chimed with their own experiences, or whether it just over-complicated things.

### _Indexing children’s books: the future is now! (Connie Binder)_

Having indexed hundreds of children’s books on a wide variety of subjects for over 20 years, Connie Binder was ideally placed to introduce conference participants to the art of indexing this particular genre. Another eminently practical session, this not only covered the actual indexing process but also touched on business practices. Connie explained at an early point that she was not talking about textbooks, which ‘take the most fascinating information and just dull it down’. However, with set formats that are easy to follow and quick to index, she admitted that textbooks can be a lucrative part of one’s indexing repertoire.

Children’s books, which range from board and picture books up to young-adult and reference books, are great fun to read, and those designed for younger readers help children to learn about book conventions and structure and find their way around them. Indexing children’s books might seem an easy and enjoyable option, but they do present some unique indexing challenges. On the upside, they are usually interesting and well written, and do not require detailed subject knowledge. However, although it is easy to fit these small books into one’s schedule, their size is also a drawback. Remuneration for each individual project is on the low side and indexers need to adopt efficient and streamlined working practices in order to achieve a reasonable hourly rate. For Connie, they form between a quarter and a third of her workload, but less in terms of income.

Turning to the actual indexing process and best practices, Connie emphasised the need for simplicity and the importance of maintaining consistency within a series. Decisions on what to index, and in what depth, will often be limited by the space available, with terms from the glossary being a good starting point. It is vital to remember that the index is for the child, not the parent, and indexing conventions that are normal in adult books will be completely incomprehensible to younger readers. It is essential to use the words that are actually in the text, to avoid subheadings and cross-references for younger children, and never to elide page ranges. (Many children will interpret 21–7 as 21 minus 7.) One surprising tip was that ‘poop’ should always be indexed, if it appears in the book, reflecting children’s fascination with such topics!

Connie noted that indexers have a huge responsibility to get it right, helping to turn children into lifelong index users, but she also raised the possible conflict between putting things where children will actually look and establishing best practice for future index use. For example, should headings be inverted or not? On this and other issues, the publisher may have guidelines.

Connie concluded by considering how to find work in this area and returned to the importance of streamlining one’s business and indexing practices to compensate for the low per-project fees. Using email templates for client communication and indexing software templates for each publisher or series, and avoiding over-indexing, are good practices for all indexers, but for these small projects they are particularly important. Her handout included a range of useful resources on best practice and obtaining work, which amplified the points she had made.

### _Using a classic to create a contemporary masterpiece: ‘on upcycling last edition’s index to create the index for a new edition’ (Maria Sullivan)_

Indexers are often asked to create an index for a subsequent edition of a publication. They can be faced with a choice between indexing the text again from scratch or updating the previous index. Maria Sullivan, who has been creating and updating indexes since 1988, considered the pros and cons of reusing an existing index and explained creative ways of manipulating that index in dedicated indexing software.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.22#fn8" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn8">8</a></sup>

Maria stated in her conference biography that she ‘hates to see anyone duplicate effort and thoroughly enjoys a good creative challenge’, but she also cautioned in her presentation that the process of reusing in index is best suited to publications that are highly structured, such as textbooks, manuals and reference books. Maria stressed that managing client expectations about this type of work is important and suggested that the first step should involve vetting the old index and ensuring that both the indexer and their client have a ‘thorough understanding’ of what is involved. She then walked through examples of comparing content from editions, converting locators and updating index entries.

Maria was very positive overall about reusing an index but noted significant pitfalls to watch out for, including attempting to work with too many changes or a badly structured index. She also cautioned against attempting any language translation and stressed that an index for a translated book should be created from scratch.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.22#fn9" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn9">9</a></sup>

This topic generated much discussion in the chat, not only about reusing indexes but also about how to use the processes for team indexing or projects that naturally involve indexing sequential issues (such as legal publications in a loose-leaf format). Several indexers talked about using similar processes for dealing with changes in page numbers after indexing has already started, particularly how to compare PDFs or versions of the text. This segued into a discussion about how indexers might handle locators in ebooks that are not page numbers, such as paragraph or section numbers.

### _EPUB is essential: it’s for more than just trade books (Bill Kasdorf and Caroline Desrosiers)_

Bill Kasdorf, principal of Kasdorf & Associates, LLC, and Caroline Desrosiers, founder and CEO of Scribely, spoke about the EPUB format for ebooks. Bill has been active in various publishing communities, including the Book Industry Study Group (BISG), Publishing@W3C, and the DAISY Consortium. The company that Caroline leads, Scribely, specialises in helping providers of digital media create accessible content for blind and visually impaired people.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.22#fn10" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn10">10</a></sup>

Bill led the way, noting that EPUB 3 has become a universal format for ebooks because it is also the standard format for accessibility. He believes that ebooks should have the full functionality of a print book; however, that is not the case when indexes and image descriptions are not included in them. Bill explained the use of page-break markers in the EPUB format, which mark where each page in the print book begins and provide the page numbers. Locators in an ebook index can be linked to these markers. Judging by the comments in the Zoom chat, many indexers in the audience already knew about and understood this concept. They wondered, though, about the implantation of these links using embedded indexing and whether it could be taken a step further: for example, using highlighting to indicate the range of relevant content for the reader after they click from a hyperlinked index locator into the text. Others noted that publishers are reluctant to provide embedded indexes and simply want to put in the page locators with no additional features. The EPUB 3 index specifications and the work currently being done by the W3C EPUB 3 Virtual Locators Working Group were mentioned.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.22#fn11" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn11">11</a></sup> Bill reiterated that it was ‘really important work’ that ‘is finally starting to bear fruit’ but noted that implementation of this work is still in the early stages.

Caroline explained the principles of writing good ‘alt text’ and extended descriptions for images. She suggested that indexers would be ideal at providing this service for publishers because of their ability to understand and describe concepts. Her suggestion echoed Joshua Tallent’s comments in his presentation that indexers should consider how their skills can expand into other areas, such as metadata creation.

## A positive take on the future of indexing

Overall, the presenters at the ASI conference offered a positive take on the future of indexing. The popularity of Dennis Duncan’s book (and Paula Clarke Bain’s index to it) has certainly brought indexers into the limelight, but it was the opportunities to take the indexing role into new realms that really resonated. Hearing about the innovative ways that indexers are already using technology in their daily practice and the possibilities for expanding the role of indexers beyond the creation of book indexes was inspiring and heartening.

The ASI conference and others like it are particularly important for new indexers, who are the future of the profession. One of the side effects of the COVID-19 pandemic has been the mushrooming of online events and the ease with which an international audience can participate. This is particularly valuable for members of niche professions with small national organisations, and for newer members it provides a golden opportunity to interact with and learn from their peers and feel that they are part of an international community. The experience of Susie Marques-Jones, who is currently studying the Society of Indexers training course, exemplifies this:

> Despite work and family commitments, I booked for the North American conferences as I think they’re so important and I knew I’d learn a lot. I also feel that I’m building up networks and friendships around the world already! The ASI conference was particularly good this year. It felt professional but also relaxed and there was plenty packed into all the talks. Gwen Henson and Devon Thomas were excellent hosts and made it all run so seamlessly (although I had problems with my camera at home). There was a diverse range of topics covered, too, and also a good mix of indexing and marketing/business sessions, which I found particularly useful as a student indexer.
> 
> I think that Paula’s and Melanie’s presentations were excellent. I had attended the SI conference, so I thought the sessions would be similar, but there was so much new information in there (along with a good dose of British humour shining through from them both!). It was interesting to see Melanie address some of the nuances in indexing practice between the US and UK in indexing the metatopic. It also reminded me that although as a student I’d like some hard-and-fast rules for indexing the metatopic (and everything else), indexing isn’t a binary endeavour and it always ‘just depends’ on a whole host of factors. My favourite session was Fred Leise’s talk, and he made editing indexes look so easy – I’ve already used his ‘Checklist’ to adapt my own practice.
> 
> I struggled to stay awake towards the end of each day, but so much extra information tends to come in the Zoom chat from all the attendees that it felt important to stay as long as possible to get any extra titbits of information. The only thing missing was smaller groups or ‘breakout rooms’ to chat more informally with others. This aspect is important, given that we’re not meeting in person, and staring at a computer screen can be a bit isolating. On the other hand, with my camera not working and feeling so tired, it was also good not to feel pressured into doing ‘30-second introductions’ of who I was and the fact that I’m still too new to make any significant contribution to group chats! It also meant that there was more time for presentations, which was a good thing. Also, either Devon or Gwen were available on screen during the breaks, and it was possible to chat then or in the ‘Happy Hour’ at the end.
> 
> Even though money is tight, I’ve found all the indexing conferences really useful so far, both in learning about indexing and meeting other indexers around the world, and if they can, I’d urge any students and new indexers to attend as many as possible.
