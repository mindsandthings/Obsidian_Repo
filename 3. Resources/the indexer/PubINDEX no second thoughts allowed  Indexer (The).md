## Abstract

PubINDEX is an indexing module from PubHub Tech that is intended to speed up the creation of embedded, hyperlinked indexes in Microsoft Word documents. However, it operates in a purely mechanical way and has no semantic analysis capabilities. In this review, Jon Jermey concludes that while PubINDEX could certainly help users to generate simple indexes and word lists, it does not appear to be a useful tool for professional indexers.

## Introduction

PubINDEX is one of several ‘productivity’ modules offered by PubHub Tech under the name of ‘PubSuite’. Their stated aim is to replace ‘outdated, error-prone and recursive processes’ in the publishing industry and thereby speed up production. Part of this service involves the imposition of centralized control over document production. Each step can be centrally monitored for completion. The other modules in the suite – ‘coming soon’ at the time of writing (May 2021) – are PubLEX for imposing consistency on documents, PubPACE for ‘picture analysis and conversion’, PubREF for creating standardized references, and PubALT for the creation of Alt-text in online documents. No information is given on pricing for these, but PubINDEX is available as a separate unit under various price options. In US dollars, these are $150 for a single use on _one_ index, $45 per month for a single user paying annually, and $135 per month for a group of up to five users paying annually. These figures are doubled for a month-by-month subscription.

So PubINDEX is not particularly cheap, and, as is the trend with modern software, you never actually own it; you only rent the right to use it. This is emphasized by the fact that it is necessary to log in online in order to use the software at all; it simply will not work without an Internet connection. You also, obviously, need Microsoft Word on your system, since PubINDEX operates by hooking into Word documents with various macros.

Assuming you can afford it, is it any good?

It certainly _looks_ good. Of the indexing add-ons to Word that I have tried, PubINDEX has the simplest and most uncluttered interface. It starts up as a stand-alone program window into which you drag and drop the Word document in question to identify it. You then supply details of what to call it, who it is by and whether you want to produce a single index or a dual index – e.g. author and subject. Unfortunately the simplicity of its operation comes at a heavy cost.

## Installation

A trial copy of PubINDEX can be downloaded from the PubHub site at www. pubsuite.tech/pubindex. Users must set up an account and log on to the site in order to use the software. The installation software defaults to a non-standard directory, and when I chose to install it in the standard program directory instead I was unable to run the program properly because of file access permissions. I had to uninstall it and reinstall it in the default directory.

It is not disclosed on the site, but although the free version is marketed as a two-week trial, you can use it for only _one_ index. If you want to test PubINDEX on jobs of different types, you will need to pay for a subscription, or create several PubHub accounts under several email addresses. PubHub should allow for more comprehensive trials if they want to win friends in the indexing community.

Once installed, the user must log in online each time they want to use the program.

After the login screen, the user either opens an existing index project or identifies a new Word document to use. This then appears in a panel on the left of the display, with an additional ‘PubINDEX’ item in the Word main menu. Unlike some similar programs, this is not a permanent feature, but disappears when you run Word normally outside PubINDEX. Selecting the options in the PubINDEX menu divides the screen, with a PubINDEX working area at the right, while the document remains on the left.

## Getting started

The first step towards indexing is to set up ‘exclusion areas’ – e.g. the preface and the references section. The user drags over these and gives each one a name to prevent it from being searched during the indexing process. This may include prefatory or end matter, tables and figures, financial reports or any other part of the document to be excluded from indexing. Once this is done and finalized, these exclusion areas cannot be altered.

A second button in the PubINDEX menu then moves the user into indexing mode. From this point on, the user can save their current work and return to an index in progress at any time.

Simple entries are added to the index panel by highlighting words or phrases in the Word document and dragging them to the right – not into the actual panel, which would seem obvious, but the area above it. PubINDEX then displays the number of times that text appears in the document and gives you an option to proceed with ‘indexing’ it. If you choose to do so, PubINDEX will scroll through the document and show you each location (other than in the exclusion areas) where that text appears. For each appearance you can choose whether or not to include it in the index. Hyperlinked page numbers appear as you add entries to the index.

The introductory video on the website naively claims that an entry which appears ‘too many’ times in a document should not be included. Often it should, but it should be included _selectively._ Unfortunately it is not possible to cancel or terminate this trip through the document; having decided to include at least some of the 62 occurrences of, say, ‘policy’ in your index, you are obliged to go through and vet them all. This is a typical feature of creating word lists, but not indexes.

Nor is there any option to search for multiple forms: if you want to include, say, ‘Joe Lyons’, ‘Joseph Lyons’ and ‘Lyons, J.’ in your index, then the only way is to search for ‘Lyons’ and manually skip the references to his wife Enid. But if you want to pick these up later, you had better hope that they all appear in some unambiguous form like ‘Enid Lyons’, as you cannot search for ‘Lyons’ as such a second time.

‘Concepts’ – i.e. ranges – can be added by opening a different tab in the right panel, typing in the name for the entry and highlighting the text block in Word before clicking an ‘Add’ button. The selected area must contain only plain text, with no external images or objects like tables. It can include text from excluded areas. The entry then appears in the index panel. At first sight, it is not a difficult operation, but it is distractingly different from the drag-and-drop method used for simple entries. And it becomes troublesome if you want to use a concept a second time. This is possible in principle, but the suitable existing concept must first be found. The concepts are not arranged alphabetically, but in the order of their first appearance. This means that finding it takes time. It is not possible to enter a concept a second time and use it immediately; if you try, an error message appears.

Terms selected for indexing are indicated by a light green outline in the document. ‘Concept’ areas are highlighted in yellow.

Index entries in the panel can be dragged on top of other entries to turn them into subheadings (only one level of subheading is permitted) and back again to return them to heading level.

At first glance, creating a subheading sounds simple. But be clear: only an existing main entry can become a subheading of another entry, and at that moment it loses its main-entry property. To create a subheading, the following steps are necessary:

•

Mark any piece of text that should serve as a ‘hook’ for a subheading and move it to the PubINDEX area.

•

Wait until PubIndex has determined the number of instances.

•

Decide whether the term should become an entry (i.e. a main entry).

•

If yes, accept one of the offered instances.

•

Deselect all other instances, so that the selected text becomes exactly one main entry.

•

Grab this main entry and move it to another existing main entry; this will assign the new entry to the first one as a subentry.

•

Since the selected text was only used as an auxiliary term to create the subentry, it must be edited.

•

Finish the editing process by pressing Enter.

•

Only now is the subentry complete.

The possibility of creating subentries quickly and specifically is one of the most important functions of a real indexing program. With PubIndex, however, the procedure is far more complicated and time-consuming than in any other software. As long as it is only about the creation of main entries, PubIndex may do a passable job. However, the result is not an index, but a word list.

As a consequence of the subheading problem, PubINDEX is also oblivious to the concept of double entry. If I want ‘Hughes, Billy’ with locators both as a main entry and as a subheading under ‘prime ministers’, it simply cannot be done. I can make a cross-reference from a subheading by bringing in some dummy term from the document, dragging it over ‘prime ministers’ to make it a subheading, editing it to say ‘Hughes, Billy’, and then making it a _see_ cross-reference to the main heading, but this is cumbersome, to say the least. And there is no way whatsoever to have an entry appear more than once, say as a heading and a subheading, or as two or more subheadings under different headings, _with the same string of locators each time._ I suspect that this will be a deal breaker for most professional indexers.

Entries – whether main entries or subentries – _cannot be copied._ Entries can be right-clicked for editing, deletion or conversion to _see_ and _see also_ references. To facilitate making cross-references, a drop-down list of headings and subheadings that already exist in the index is displayed. Edited entries are reshuffled automatically into alphabetical order.

Speaking of alphabetical order, PubIndex does not offer any possibility to influence the sorting of entries.

As a simple index-term editor, PubINDEX is tidy and effective, but there is no way to alter or delete the index locators once they have been created. You can change ‘Billy Hughes’ to ‘Hughes, Billy’, but if you decide that the reference to Hughes on page 37 was really just a passing mention, bad luck; there is no way to remove it from the generated index. Nor can you add new locators to a finished heading. Dragging an entry for ‘Hughes’ into the index and then editing it to ‘Hughes, Billy’ will simply add a second, unique item to the index under that heading.

With the ‘dual index’ option selected, the mark-up process is similar, but users click a tab each time to select which index they want to add the term or concept to.

The user can generate an index at any time, and view it at the end of the Word document. The already limited number of formatting options provided by Word are further reduced, to number of columns, letters as alphabet separators, and run-on or indented subheadings. Existing indexes can be edited and reworked – within the limits of the program – up until the moment when the final index is ‘submitted’ to a central control site, whereupon it is locked. After this a completed Word document, with the index attached, can only be downloaded from that site. (But subscribers to the ‘free trial’ cannot do that either.)

Presumably a user who was familiar with indexing in Word could then go back and edit a ‘finished’ document to remediate some of the flaws caused by the PubINDEX workflow, but it is hard to see that this would be any better than starting with Word itself or one of the alternative indexing systems which are more forgiving of the need to correct and revise.

## Problems

There are other, more minor, annoyances too. Cross-references _to_ subheadings do not show the main heading at all; they say ‘Hughes, Billy _see_ Hughes, Billy’, when what they mean is ‘Hughes, Billy _see_ Prime Ministers: Hughes, Billy’. The hyperlinked reference works correctly, but the text is misleading. Keyboard and mouse use could be made more efficient in various ways: for instance, default names could be supplied for exclusion zones and concept areas, and the program should not have to ask whether you want to include a specific term when you have already said you want to index it and there is only one occurrence. There are some noisy pop-up windows which tell you when processes are completed and need to be acknowledged with a button click. These are mostly unnecessary, since you cannot do anything else until then anyway.

A serious problem is data protection. It is not really clear where the data of the index document and the index itself are located: only on the local computer or also in the cloud? What happens to the data in the cloud after a project is completed? Are they deleted or do they remain there? Can I as a user insist that they be deleted in any case? Who owns the copyright to the index? There are no clear statements on this in the general terms and conditions. The privacy policy is only about data security, not data protection.

The PubINDEX website is glossy and corporate, with the usual stock images of happy smiling professionals, and the brief video tutorials that it provides are excellent, but there is relatively little content, and only two testimonials from users, only one of whom is said to be a professional indexer. The blog contains only two blog entries, and these are undated, although one does link to the American Society for Indexing (ASI) website. And, as mentioned above, the planned companion software modules do not appear to have materialized yet.

## Summary

PubINDEX has a slick and user-friendly interface which, despite a few odd quirks, can be mastered and used fairly rapidly, built over an indexing system which misses two of the most fundamental purposes of indexing – creating subentries straightforwardly and giving different points of access to the same material. As with so much of the software advertised for ‘indexing’, PubHub seems to have taken a superficial view of the processes involved, and sought to mechanize them without considering why they are being done in the first place.

It is possible that if you are working on small, well-structured documents, indexing only unambiguous names and other proper nouns, and eschewing subentries, crossreferences and double entries, then PubINDEX, despite its limitations, could speed up your workflow. Provided, that is, you never make a mistake in selecting a locator – or, more realistically, that your clients are prepared to tolerate mistakes. And if PubHub can keep their attractive interface while rebuilding the macros underneath it to avoid its limitations, then it may have a future in other indexing work too. But its fundamental flaws, coupled with its premium pricing, will keep it out of the hands of professional indexers for now.
