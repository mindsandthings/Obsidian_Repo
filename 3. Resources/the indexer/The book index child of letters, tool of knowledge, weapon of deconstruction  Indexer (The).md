## Abstract

The humble book index has a long and distinguished history, intertwined not only with the development of alphabetical order and the codex, but also with the evolution of a new worldview based on rationalism rather than divine order – one in which reader is coequal with author in the freedom to analyse, synthesize and connect ideas. Drawing on the work of a number of scholars, Michele Combs traces this fascinating genealogy, showing that the index can be seen not only as an artifact and a reference tool but also as an explosive device.

The modern back-of-the-book index is so ubiquitous these days that it’s hard to imagine a time without it, and yet it is a relatively new invention, coming some 3,000 years after the alphabet. On the surface it is an unremarkable thing, but it is more important than its simple appearance (single words or phrases), humble location (at the end, in smaller type) and anonymity (indexers are usually uncredited) might suggest. Indexes are connected not only with the physical history of the book, but also with the evolving worldview and ongoing conversation of the mind that is the basis of scholarship. Because of this, the index can be seen as an object, as a tool, and as an explosive device.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup>

## Index as object: the alphabet and the codex

In its most simple form, a typical back-of-book subject index is simply a list of _terms_, in _alphabetical order_, with _locators_ directing the reader to the place(s) in the text where the term is discussed. These terms may be names (Churchill, Winston), concrete nouns (dogs), abstract concepts (loyalty), or anything in between, from ‘civil marriage’ to ‘social media’. Alphabetical order is simply the familiar sequence of A to Z. Locators are most frequently page numbers, though they may be paragraph numbers, section numbers, or something else. In the following paragraphs, when we refer to _the index_ or _indexes_, it is this constellation of features to which we refer.

What, then, were the material prerequisites for this object? First, writing. Because an index requires the ability to direct the reader to a specific place in a narrative, any flow of spoken words – a folktale told by a grandmother, an orator’s speech on the floor of the Senate, a series of news broadcasts – is _non-indexable_ unless and until those spoken words are fixed in some persistent form. Systems of knowledge transmission that relied on the oral tradition are thus non-indexable by their very nature.

There are many types and forms of writing, of course. There is pictographic, in which a symbol is a stylized picture of the thing it represents – the WALK/DON’T WALK symbols at a street crossing, for example. There are ideographic systems, in which a symbol represents an idea or concept comprehensible across languages – a knife and fork with a red slash indicating ‘Eating is not permitted here’. There are logographic systems, in which a character represents an entire word or morpheme (meaningful unit): Egyptian hieroglyphics, for example, or Chinese. There are syllabic systems, in which a character represents a syllable; examples of this include Cherokee, and Japanese katakana and hiragana. Alphabetic systems are unique in that the individual characters have no inherent meaning whatsoever, and each character represents a single sound.

Many of these other systems have existed far longer than the alphabet, but are ill-suited to the creation of indexes for two reasons. First, all of the nonalphabetic systems require hundreds, if not thousands, of characters (Mandarin Chinese, for example, has more than ten thousand, though not all are in regular or current use). Second, because characters in nonalphabetic systems are tied to units of meaning (ideas, words, morphemes), they have no fixed order. The index as we know it today thus required a particular _kind_ of writing – specifically, an alphabetic script with a fixed order ([Beare, 2007](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R1): 257). For this reason, any discussion of the development of the index (as we are defining it here) will of necessity be somewhat Western-centric.

Judith Flanders, in her book _A place for everything_, says that while writing originated perhaps three times in human history, the alphabet arose only once, among Semitic tribes in what we now call the Middle East ([Flanders, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R13): xviii). All known alphabetic scripts today are its descendants. And the evidence strongly suggests that from the alphabet’s earliest days, it had a fixed order that was commonly known and accepted. One of the earliest pieces of evidence for this comes from modern-day Syria in the form of an ‘ABC’ of the Ugarit script dating from the fourteenth century BCE ([Berger, 2006](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R2): 95). Interestingly, from its earliest days alphabetic order was used to indicate _sequence_. Archaeologists have found tiles and wooden beams inscribed with letters of the alphabet to indicate the order in which they were to be assembled, and names carved on columns in alphabetic order ([Flanders, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R13): 12). But the idea of using the alphabet to _sort_ things was still many centuries away.

Another physical barrier to the index as we know it today is that all early writing was done on scrolls – continuous strips, read by unrolling one side and rolling it up on the other side, rather like reading a roll of microfilm. This physical limitation meant that indexes as we know them today would not have been practical. Although only nine to ten inches wide (about 25 centimeters), scrolls could be unwieldy in length – up to 30 feet (nine meters) ([Stockwell, 2001](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R18): 31). One of the largest extant scrolls is the Great Isaiah Scroll (734 cm or 288 inches). Its 54 columns contain all 66 chapters of the Hebrew version of the Book of Isaiah.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> While it might perhaps be possible to indicate that a desired topic appeared at a particular place in a scroll, it would be cumbersome and time-consuming for the reader to get to that location – they could not get to, say, Isaiah 45:12 without first passing through the preceding 44 chapters and 11 verses. In other words, a scroll is not a ‘random-access’ technology that allows the reader to go directly to a particular location.

The final material development necessary for the index as we know it, then, was the codex, consisting of pages bound together along one edge – in other words, a book ([Witty, 1973](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R21): 196). The codex was important because it was _addressable._ That is, a reader could open directly to the desired location. The oldest known evidence of the codex comes from the first century CE, a tiny fragment known as De Bellis Macedonici ([British Library, 2015](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R8)). Scholars believe it was part of a codex because it has text on both sides in the same orientation, which would not have been the case with a scroll. In contemporary writing of the time, there are occasional mentions also of parchment notebooks being particularly popular with travelers, as they were more easily transportable than bookrolls.

In addition to being addressable, the codex was also portable and durable. For these reasons the transition from scroll to codex is intimately linked with the rise of Christianity; as an evangelical but often persecuted religion, its adherents took immediately to a technology that was easy to carry, easy to use, and easy to hide (see [Lerner, 2009](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R16): 23; [Duncan and Smyth, 2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R12): 266; [Flanders, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R13): 25).

With the codex the index became possible – but it was by no means inevitable. Scribes did not suddenly begin indexing their books; kings did not create alphabetic indexes of their taxpaying subjects; bishops did not start listing where in the Church Fathers one could find mention of whales, wine, and women. Christianity might refer to Christ as ‘the Alpha and Omega’, but as a method of arranging the world alphabetical order was only one of many, and was far from the most popular or common. Religion infused everything, and with it the belief – derived from classical Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle – that there was a natural hierarchy to the world and everything had its place. God presided at the top with the various kinds of angels just below, followed by humans, then animals, then plants, and finally minerals. This hierarchical worldview, being divinely ordained and immutable, was far more important and meaningful than the random order produced by a simple coincidence of letters.

Each level had its own internal hierarchy, too – for humanity, this meant the Church at the top and the lowest peasant at the bottom. The organization of documents consciously reflected and perpetuated this worldview, in both secular and religious contexts. The Roman scholar Cassiodorus (fifth century CE) developed a classification system for his library according to how close each item was to God’s truth: the Bible came top, followed by the Church Fathers, later/lesser commentaries, and finally Greek and Latin poets and orators ([Wright, 2007](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R22): 87–8). Scholars structured their work by it; Alexander Neckham’s eleventh-century proto-encyclopedia _De naturis rerum_, for example, begins with the creation of the world and ends with society and sin, while Bartholomew de Glanville’s _De proprietatibus rerum_ was ‘arranged in the systematic order of most such medieval writings – beginning with God and the angels and ending with weights, measure, numbers and sounds’ ([Stockwell, 2001](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R18): 40–1). The _Liber feudorum maior_, a cartulary from twelfth-century Aragon, contains copies of more than 900 documents necessary for the administration of the kingdom.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup> The documents are organized hierarchically by fief or region of control (county, viscounty, given castle or estate) and within that chronologically ([Friedrich, 2018](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R14): 22). Not only was this arrangement relevant to the user of the document, whose primary interest was administrative, but it also reflected the relative positions and importance of the various regions and, of course, their rulers.

Alphabetical order was used occasionally, of course, but more often as an organizational principle for a book as a whole rather than as a method of access to a corpus of documents or to content within a single volume. Herbariums in particular seem to have employed alphabetical order in their arrangement of articles. (Medical texts, on the other hand, were often organized _a capite ad calcem_, moving ‘from head to heels’, another type of hierarchy; see [Flanders, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R13): 88–9.) But for most people in most situations, alphabetical order was considered random and therefore meaningless. Ordering information hierarchically was more natural, given the world in which they lived and their perceived place in it.

When we do begin to see indexes, they are often in a form that requires or assumes prior knowledge on the part of the reader in order to be useful. For example, the _Sermones de tempore et de sanctis_ (fourteenth or fifteenth century CE) is a large volume of sermons organized by the date of the saint’s feast. A _tabula_ or ‘table’ at the front lists various topics in alphabetical order, and each topic directs the reader to one or more sermons. Thus, looking in the table under ‘_Virtutes_’ (virtue) the reader is directed to ‘St Andrew’. To find the relevant sermon the reader would need to know that St Andrew’s festal day is 30 November, and therefore near the end of the volume ([Weinberg, 2007](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R20): 249–50). This index also refers the user to an entire sermon on a given topic, not to a specific line or page where a topic is mentioned or discussed. In that sense it is more analogous to journal indexing, though of course without the benefit of a controlled vocabulary.

We do begin to see the identification of specific points (topics) within the text as important in medieval illuminated manuscripts in the form of ‘manicules’, small drawings of a hand with the first finger (or occasionally the second) extended pointing to a word or line – a kind of medieval Post-it note (see [Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#F1)). It is no accident that the Latin word _indicō_ (point out, indicate, show) is also the origin of the word ‘index’, thus connected with both the pointing finger and that at which it points. Some scribes went a step further: rather than just draw a pointy hand, they actually wrote in the margin the topic of interest. The Beinecke Library at Yale holds one manuscript from about 1260 CE in which the scribe not only jotted topics in the margin, but also added a page number in the upper right corner. These words could then be transcribed onto separate pages in alphabetical order. And in fact if one turns to the end of this volume, one can see the index pages where the scribe has compiled these entries under their appropriate letter.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup>

The medieval universities, with their ‘renewed interest in theology, philosophy, and law, and particularly the passion … for scholastic disputation … \[which\] require\[d\] ready reference to the authorities’, no doubt encouraged the creation of personal indexes by students and professors ([Witty, 1973](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R21): 197). Nevertheless, as we near the end of the thirteenth century the index remains the province of a select few, still uncommon enough to require explanation. In one copy of _Summa confessorum_ (c.1297), which contains one of the earliest-known subject indexes to a book ([Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#F1)), the scribe has included a head note explaining what he’s doing:

> Hie nach volget das Register über das buch/gena\[nn\]t Sum\[m\]a Iohan\[n\]is Nach ordnung des Abc etc.
> 
> Hereafter follows the Register of the book/called Sum\[m\]a Iohan\[n\]is in order of the Abc etc.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup>

In the body of the index (or Register), the topics appear alphabetically beginning with _abschlossen_ (absolution), but note the order of the subheadings:

> Warvon ein bapst gemeeynlich den menschen müst ablösen
> 
> Wavon ein ba\[p\]st besund\[er\] ablöset de\[n\] menschen
> 
> Wavon ein bischoff gemeinlich müst ablösen
> 
> Wavon ein bischoff besunder ablöset den me\[n\]schen
> 
> Was ein pfarrer ablösen müst von was nit
> 
> Ein pfarrer mag ablösen von alle\[n\] sünden
> 
> Wavon ein fremder priester müst ablösen
> 
> What a pope must absolve a person from in general
> 
> What a pope must absolve a person from in particular
> 
> What a bishop must absolve from in general
> 
> What a bishop absolves a person from in particular
> 
> What a pastor doesn’t have to absolve from
> 
> A pastor may absolve from all sins
> 
> What a foreign priest must absolve from.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#fn7" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn7">7</a></sup>

We begin with the pope, then move down through bishops and pastors, finishing up with foreign priests. Once again, the hierarchical worldview imposes itself onto the structure.

In the index to the Bible in [Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#F3) (_c_.1480 CE), we see topics organized alphabetically, but as with the _Sermones_ the work shows an assumption of prior knowledge on the part of the user. Because the index creator has chosen to use books and chapters of the Bible as locators, the reader would need to know where in the Bible a given book falls. (Since most literate people at this time were associated with the Church, this was a reasonable assumption.) For example, under ‘draco’ we find the entry ‘Draco dicit rex egypti’, whose locators include Ezekiel 29, with an ‘a’ appended. At this point the Bible had been divided into chapters but not yet into verses, so the indexer has used the letters a through g to indicate roughly where in the chapter to look. And indeed, if one goes to the beginning of Ezekiel 29, one finds this: ‘Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great _dragon_ that lieth in the midst of his rivers’ (Rosenthal 90, Beinecke Library, Yale University).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#fn8" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn8">8</a></sup>

With the advent of the printing press in 1440 (moveable type had been in use in China and other parts of Asia for two centuries, but hitherto had been unknown in Europe), printers sometimes took the initiative to add indexes when they reprinted classical or religious works. Still, they did not necessarily expect their readers to know how to use them. In Caxton’s fifteenth-century printing of _Legenda aurea sanctorum_, a thirteenth-century collection of legends concerning the saints, the printer helpfully added an index – but felt it necessary to include this explanatory prologue:

> And to thende eche hystoryy lyf & passyon may be shortely founden I have ordeyned this table folowyng / where & and in what leef he shal fynde suche as shal be desired / and have sette the nombre of every leef in the margyne. (quoted in [Duncan and Smyth, 2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R12): 271)

At this point we are 1,400 years beyond the building blocks of writing, alphabet, and codex. All the pieces are in place. And yet as late as 1501 only 10 percent of printed books contained indexes ([Flanders, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R13): 114). Why are they still so rare?

## Index as tool: a changing intellectual landscape

Consider the intellectual landscape at this time: books are utilitarian, serving an administrative or religious function. The primary readers are Church prelates or royal functionaries, who generally already know where to look to find what they need. And the prevailing worldview is deeply hierarchical, from God to the divine right of kings down to the peasant in the field. Everyone knows his or her own place and expects to stay in it. Anyone seeking knowledge beyond the position into which they are born is viewed with skepticism, if not hostility. What need for indexes in a world like this?

But we are at an inflection point. Gutenberg’s printing press enabled the rapid production of books, cheaply (and with consistent pagination!); by 1460 there were presses in Italy, Spain, France, and England, and by 1490 more books had been produced in the elapsed fifty years than in the preceding thousand ([Flanders, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R13): 108). Beginning in 1517 the Reformation shattered the hegemony of the Church in Western Europe, removing its aura of infallibility and introducing the idea that an individual could – indeed, should – interact directly with texts, holy and otherwise. In the 1500s and 1600s Renaissance humanism rediscovered classical and ancient writings (which had survived largely thanks to Arab and Islamic scholars) and created a community of students eager for knowledge, many of whom began to create their own indexes to important texts and to print and circulate them as standalone publications ([Conrau-Lewis, 2018](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R10)). And in the 1700s the Enlightenment shook the foundations of ‘natural hierarchy’ by proposing the radical idea that knowledge was valuable for its own sake and ought to be available to everyone. The intellectual landscape at the end of the eighteenth century was wildly different than it had been at the end of the fifteenth.

With these important changes we at last begin to see the rise of the index as we know it today. No longer is the index a one-off, tied to a particular handwritten text, for private use by scholars and those with prior knowledge. It becomes a generalized information access tool – something widely accepted, desired, even expected. (Although as late as 1584, the compiler of a French bibliography in his preface apologized to the king for ‘the impropriety of having thus observed an alphabetical or A, B, C order’, admitting that it violated the natural way of things because it meant that entries for lesser men might appear before those of their superiors ([Flanders, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R13): xxii)).

The story of the _Schedario Garampi_ exemplifies this transformation. Giuseppe Garampi (1725–92) was an Italian scholar and prefect of the Vatican Archives for some twenty years. Among his planned projects were several massive Church histories, and to help him in his work he created his own index consisting of thousands of tiny slips of paper, on each of which was written a topic and an archival reference. Garampi was diverted into diplomatic work and died before finishing his books, leaving behind his boxes of slips – some say 800,000, others estimate 1.5 million. The boxes sat undisturbed for decades until the Vatican opened its libraries to researchers in the nineteenth century, at which point archivists realized what a treasure they had in these minuscule paper scraps. They pasted the slips into 124 volumes, creating a monumental reference work which is still used by researchers today. What began as one man’s idiosyncratic pursuit in support of his own writing became a general-purpose access tool used by thousands ([Burns, 2000](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R9): 61–5; [Friedrich, 2018](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R14): 58).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#fn9" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn9">9</a></sup>

As with any innovation, however, not everyone was happy with the growing prevalence of indexes. Some feared that readers would simply skim the index and disregard the rest of the text; others sneered at those who ‘confuse\[d\] the map for the territory’. Detractors were vocal through the years. Galileo mocked readers who chose not to pursue real-world knowledge of ‘ships or crossbows or cannons, but retire into their studies to glance through an index or a table of contents to see whether Aristotle has said anything about them,’ while Jonathan Swift scathingly referred to ‘Men who pretend to understand a Book, by scouting thro’ the _Index_, as if a traveler should go about to describe a _Palace_, when he has seen nothing but the _Privy_’ ([Duncan and Smyth, 2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R12): 272).

But the index, once started, would not be halted. By the end of the seventeenth century, indexes were so familiar that authors could employ them as a vehicle for pointed humor, knowing that readers would get the joke. In early 1699 Richard Bentley, an English classical scholar and theologian, wrote a small book exposing the _Epistles of Phalaris_, allegedly dating from the sixth century BCE, as fakes created some 800 years later. Dr Charles Boyle, the original editor of the _Epistles_, was not happy, and published a rebuttal of Bentley’s work which concludes with ‘A Short Account of Dr. Bentley, By way of INDEX’. This index contains such gems as ‘His \[Bentley’s\] familiar acquaintance with Books that he never saw’, and the main entry ‘His Ingenuity in’, which includes the subentry ‘transcribing and plundering Notes and Prefaces of’ with seven sub-subentries. Perhaps the most scathing, however, is ‘His modesty and decency in contradicting great men’, whose 15 subentries begin with ‘Plato’ and end with ‘Everybody’ ([Boyle, 1698](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R7)).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#fn10" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn10">10</a></sup>

The eighteenth-century Age of Enlightenment could also justly be called the Age of the Encyclopedia. Between 1646 and 1829, dozens of these repositories of knowledge were created, published, and circulated in Europe and America. Behind each of these ventures was the belief that all knowledge could be collected, and that it should be available to everyone. These were not the first encyclopedias – they had been known in China, for example, and ancient Rome – but these were the first that were mass-produced by printing and explicitly intended for use by everyone, not just the elite or scholars.

Many of these projects were, once again, structured on hierarchical principles rather than alphabetic, but because they were so huge the editors recognized the need for an index. The _Pseudoxia Epidemica_, for example, published in 1646 and one of the first in what was to become a veritable flood, was organized by categories, such as ‘THE SECOND BOOK BEGINNING THE PARTICULAR PART CONCERNING MINERALL AND VEGETABLE BODIES’, but it also had an index.

This firm belief that the general public should be able to find out anything about everything (or everything about anything), and do so outside the paternal guiding hand of the Church, made some people, particularly those in power, nervous – in fact, the famous French _Encyclopédie_ (1750) of Diderot and D’Alembert was at first banned and later heavily censored by the French government. And that bring us to our final perspective.

## Index as explosive device: the atomization of knowledge

In 1902, Lord Campbell proposed that British authors who failed to include an index should be deprived of copyright to their work and fined. Another fiery indexophile advocated that ‘the man who published a book without an index ought to be damned ten miles beyond Hell, where the Devil could not get for stinging nettles’ (quoted in [Beare, 2007](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R1): 261). While some indexers lamented that they were underappreciated and underpaid (_plus ça change_ …), noted man of letters Isaac D’Israeli was full of praise for their work: ‘I for my part venerate the inventor of Indexes; and I know not to whom to yield preference, either to Hippocrates, who was the first great anatomiser of the human body, or to that unknown laborer in literature who first laid open the veins and arteries of a book’ (see [Duncan, 2021](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R11): 164–5; [Stäheli, 2016](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R17): 17)

What these three statements have in common is a clear acknowledgment of the value of the index to the reader. Two of them argue that the rights of the reader are equal, if not superior, to those of the author or publisher, and the third explicitly recognizes that the value of the index lies in its _deconstruction_ of the text. We have traveled a long way indeed from the ancient idea of the universe as an organic, unchanging, divinely ordained whole.

The index is in fact unique among the parts of a book in that it purely and solely serves the reader. A table of contents or list of figures repeats titles the author has composed, in the order the author placed them in. An abstract condenses the author’s argument or thesis. Endnotes support the author’s claims (by citing other authors). The index, on the other hand, disregards the author’s carefully planned narrative entirely. More, it literally explodes the unity that is the book, transforming a carefully structured narrative into isolated pieces. It then places these pieces in order not by sense or meaning or innate qualities or how they relate to one another, but purely by the accident of spelling. The reader may then access at will any piece – any atom – of information they wish. To find a desired topic requires no prior knowledge of the domain or the text, only the memorization of 26 characters and their order. The alphabet – the key to the index – is neutral, the ultimate in democratization.

That said, there is also a hidden political aspect, with ‘political’ being defined in the broad sense of ‘the organization and operation of power’. As mentioned above, the index removes power from the author and bestows it on the reader, but part of that process involves the indexer’s exercise of power in creating the index. Urs Stäheli, a professor of sociology at the University of Hamburg whose research focuses on systems theory, sociocultural theory, and connectivity, explored the politics of indexing in a fascinating article in 2016. He points out that ‘list-making is not only a problem of selection, but it is also a transformative and performative practice; it produces the items which the list will comprise … The politics of lists starts with techniques to isolate such items’ ([Stäheli, 2016](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R17): 14–15). He also suggests additional reasons, other than those discussed above, why the index produced anxiety:

> It is precisely because … \[it\] is neither simply a representation nor an add-on that it entails a political dimension: it produces new forms of knowledge and control that are often seen as a threat to the integrity of the text to be indexed; and it points at the unease which the invisible work of the indexer produces because the rules which govern the indexing are often hidden from any public conversation. (Staheli, 2016: 16)

If this does not immediately make one think of the mysterious proprietary algorithms of Google and Facebook, it should; it also goes a long way towards explaining the paradox of both liberals and conservatives claiming that social media oppress them and favor their opponents.

That said, an index is neutral in the sense that it can help in locating things, but not in understanding them. It has ‘abandon\[ed\] any ethical, historical, or argumentative ordering principle in order to be usable’ (Staheli, 2016: 18). The index thus empowers the reader, enabling them to use, reuse, break apart, and reconnect ideas however they wish, both within and among texts. As Stäheli observes,

> An index produces not only an urge towards order, but also the urge to create new connections … What the index announces is a new mode of control of knowledge – a control that does not primarily rest on the question of which users have access to the index, but instead concerns how the index transforms existing knowledge and the dreams of total knowledge the index generates. ([Stäheli, 2016](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R17): 22, 19)

Although the index is, at first glance, simply no more than a collection of pointers – a static access tool to a fixed text – it is in reality much more. By breaking a text into its component concepts, it frees readers to do as they wish with those concepts. Like splitting the atom, an index releases power, converting a finished product (a book) into the raw material of new ideas, new connections, and new conclusions.

## Footnotes

1

The development of the index has received considerable recent media attention beyond the academic and indexing communities following the publication of Dennis Duncan’s acclaimed _Index, a history of the_ (2021). Aspects of that history have already been covered in the pages of this journal, and in the academic literature. In addition to the books and articles cited in the text, the work of [Ann Blair (2000](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R4); [2010](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R5); and on _Fivebooks.com_), and [Bella Hass Weinberg (1999)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R19) have been particularly useful in the preparation of this article and the conference presentation on which it is based.

[Hurwitz (2008)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.2#core-R15) notes that indexing ‘slips’ were still being used in the early twentieth century and were even referred to in the late 1970s, although by then they had largely been superseded by the index cards familiar to library users throughout the century.
