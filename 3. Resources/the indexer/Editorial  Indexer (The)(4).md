Publication: The Indexer: The International Journal of Indexing

Volume 38, Number 4

It is not often that book indexers are the subject matter of history, so I hope that you enjoy this issue, which is chock-full of intriguing tales of indexers past and present. How can indexers in the present time be history, you ask? Well, as John Gardner notes, ‘History never looks like history when you are living through it. It always looks confusing and messy, and it always looks uncomfortable.’<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.34#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup>

Messy and uncomfortable certainly applies to our life now in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ann Kingdom documents the challenges for freelance book indexers navigating this uncertain period with her report on a global survey. Thank you to everyone around the world who participated. The responses certainly reflect mess and discomfort but also surprisingly positive impacts, such as indexers who are busier than ever with work and a publishing industry that is getting used to the ‘new normal’. While it may be a long time yet before we are able to feel tidy and comfortable again, it is good to know that not all is doom and gloom.

But if you prefer your history a bit more comfortable, I suggest you read Nicola King’s fascinating account of the term ‘indexer’ in British census returns between 1851 and 1911. This history is certainly messy, as you will see from the many and varied terms used to describe the work of indexers, but Nicola has done a fabulous job of digging into the records and giving us intriguing glimpses of their lives. Ann Hudson also brings indexers of the past into the light with her history of the Society of Indexers (SI) training course, which started with a series of evening lectures in 1958 and is now in its fifth edition, launched in July 2020. As you can imagine, the course has been through many transformations during those 62 years. Ann takes us on an entertaining journey through its evolution, including first-hand accounts from students and instructors.

Book indexing continues as the focus in this issue. You will find the next part of Walter Greulich’s excellent series on how to do embedded indexing using Word, Stephen Ullstrom’s careful unravelling of that common bit of advice ‘do not rewrite the book in the index’, and a review of the fourth edition of Hazel Bell’s _Indexing biographies_.

It is nice to see the conference calendar starting to fill again, though mainly with virtual events. However, the Berlin international conference has been postponed for a year in the hope that by 2022 indexers will be able to travel and meet in person again. But we have been able to include some good news with a report on the winners of several recent indexing awards in the US, the UK and Canada. Although meeting up in person is some time in the future, I hope that through the pages of _The Indexer_, as well as a variety of online events and forums run by the indexing societies, you feel connected to the international indexing community and ongoing developments in our profession.

As this is the last issue for 2020, I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to _The Indexer_ over the past year, including authors, reviewers and our lovely staff at the Society of Indexers and Liverpool University Press. I appreciate your efforts to keep the journal going through uncertain times. And I wish all of our readers a more comfortable, less messy, and happy new year!
