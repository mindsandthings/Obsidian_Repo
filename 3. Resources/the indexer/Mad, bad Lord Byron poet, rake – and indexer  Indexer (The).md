## Abstract

Was the English poet Lord Byron an indexer? Hazel Bell examines the index in the 1926 edition of _The poetical works of Lord Byron_, which is written in a provocative style that reinforces the opinions expressed in the notes that accompany Byron’s poetry. Sadly, the indexer is not named. Whether or not it was written by the poet himself, it is a fascinating index that has sadly been omitted from a later edition.

I considered the subject indexing of poetry in this journal ten years ago ([Bell, 2011](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.26#core-R1)), and found then a varied assortment of volumes, from the eighteenth century on, that included such indexes. I concluded that purported ‘subject indexes’ to volumes of poetry often proved to be merely classifications of collections of poems, while subject indexing proper presented great difficulties, and might provide entertainment, whether by inadvertent absurdity or deliberate wit.

Now I have come across a copy of Oxford University Press’s 1926 edition of _The poetical works of Lord Byron_ (thus designated on the title page: on the front cover \[calf-bound\] it is presented as _The poems of Lord Byron_, and on the spine as _Byron’s complete poetical works):_ the tenth reprint of an edition first published in 1904. The volume comprises ten pages of prelims and 840 pages of poems (some with long prose prefaces), followed by notes (which include a four-page Appendix to ‘Marino Faliero, Doge of Venice’) on pages 841–903 and a 19-page index.

No editor is named in this edition, and the 62 pages of notes, unattributed, are written with strong feeling, often in the first person, clearly by Byron himself for early editions of his poems, acting as his own editor – witness the note to his poem ‘To the Duke of Dorset’:

> In looking over my papers to select a few additional poems for this second edition, I found the above lines, which I had totally forgotten, composed in the summer of 1805, a short time previous to my departure from Harrow. They were addressed to a young school-fellow of high rank, who had been my frequent companion in some rambles through the neighbouring country: however, he never saw the lines, and most probably never will. As, on a reperusal, I found them not worse than some other pieces in the collection, I have now published them, for the first time, after a slight revision.

Was he his own publisher as well as editor? And to ‘Elegy on Newstead Abbey’:

> As one poem on this subject is already printed, the author had, originally, no intention of inserting the following. It is now added at the particular request of some friends.

There are some other highly personal notes in this volume. This is a note to the poem ‘On the death of a young lady’:

> The author claims the indulgence of the reader more for this piece than, perhaps, any other in the collection; but as it was written at an earlier period than the rest (being composed at the age of fourteen), and his first essay, he preferred submitting it to the indulgence of his friends in its present state, to making either addition or alteration.

And this to ‘Oscar of Alva: A Tale’:

> In the above little piece the author has been accused by some _candid readers_ of introducing the name of a lady from whom he was some hundred miles distant at the time this was written …

Note to ‘Lachin Y Gair’:

> I allude here to my maternal ancestors, “the Gordons,” many of whom fought for the unfortunate Prince Charles …

Note to the opening of ‘The Giaour’:

> The attachment of the nightingale to the rose is a well-known Persian fable. If I mistake not, the “Bulbul of a thousand tales” is one of his appellations.

Following the notes, beginning on page 905, comes the index. This is headed simply ‘Index’, in Gothic type. The note beneath the heading states:

> The title of the principal pieces are printed in small capitals, and the first line of every distinct piece, and of every canto, in _italics._

The index to a volume of poetry might be supposed to contain entries of no other than those two types, but this one includes besides many entries in roman type, such as might be found in any book of narrative text, and several with subheadings, indexing the content of the notes as well as the poems.

Let us examine some sample entries in the index. Punctuation and layout for the index entries are as in the original text: the entire volume – poems, notes and index – is set in double columns. Quotations from the poems within the entries are within quotation marks, as in the original. Page numbers higher than 840 refer to the notes. My own comments are interpolated, following the relevant quotations from the index.

> Agrarian Laws, simile drawn from the, 767. Tiberius
> 
> Gracchus’s demand for their execution, 900.

On page 767, in Canto X stanza XXV of _Don Juan_, we find these lines:

> Death, the sovereign’s sovereign, though the great
> 
> Gracchus of all mortality, who levels,
> 
> With his Agrarian laws, the high estate
> 
> Of him who feasts, and fights, and roars, and revels

What the indexer has chosen to draw attention to here is the simile – Death as Gracchus. Might it be more fitting for the index to a textbook on English literary terms? Page 900 falls in the pages of notes, and is straightforward explanation, as in any textbook.

> "Ambition’s honour’d fools," 182; "steel’d thee" (Napoleon) "on too far," 208. "Vile ambition," 232; "forsook his crown to follow woman," 58."Ambition in his humbled hour," 331. "Glorious ambition," 599. "Ambition was my idol," 649. "Blood only serves to wash ambition’s hands," 761.

This smacks rather of a classification of poems referring to ambition.

> Angling, "that solitary vice," 804.
> 
> Annuitants, alleged longevity of, 657.
> 
> Argus, Ulysses’ dog, modern contrast to, 676.
> 
> Athens, apostrophe to, 190. On the removal of its sculptured remains, 191, 859. Its situation, climate, &c., 863-4.

On page 190, Canto II/II of _Childe Harold’s pilgrimage_ opens thus:

> Ancient of Days! August Athena! where,
> 
> Where are thy men of might? thy grand in soul?

On page 191, the Poet is sitting ‘upon this massy stone’ contemplating the site of the temple in Athens. Stanza XI runs:

> But who, of all the plunderers of yon Fane On high – where Pallas linger’d, loth to flee The latest relic of her ancient reign –
> 
> The last, the worst, dull spoiler, who was he?
> 
> Blush, Caledonia! such thy son could be!
> 
> England! I joy no child he was of thine:
> 
> Thy free-born men should spare what once was free;
> 
> Yet they could violate each saddening shrine,
> 
> And hear these altars o’er the long-reluctant brine.

On page 859 we find nearly a full-page note (in tiny print) naming and denouncing Lord Elgin and his deeds – supplementary information, subjectively expressed.

> Augustine, Saint, and his confessions, 632. His dictum on the impossible, 827. His youthful irregularities, 895.
> 
> Avarice, "a good old-gentlemanly vice," 649. Byron’s panegyric on, 784, 785.
> 
> Boleyn, Anne, remark of, on the scaffold, 880.
> 
> More, Sir Thomas, on the scaffold, 880.

Page 880 contains only notes; under the heading ‘Page 283, col. 2.’ a nine-line note quotes ‘Till even the scaffold echoes with their jest!’ and muses on fashionable _mots_ as legacy, citing these two examples. Following the trail back to page 283, column 2, one finds Canto II/XIII of _The Corsair_:

> Strange though it seem–yet with extremest grief
> 
> Is linked a mirth–it doth not bring relief–
> 
> That playfulness of Sorrow ne’er beguiles,
> 
> And smiles in bitterness–but still it smiles;
> 
> And sometimes with the wisest and the best,
> 
> Till even the scaffold echoes with their jest!

But who would think of searching for Anne Boleyn or Sir Thomas More in a volume of the poems of Byron?

> Bullfight, description of a, 186. Inveterate rage for the amusement in Spain and its results, 187.

This is valid, but certainly not an objective indication of the matter of the poem. The following sequence of entries might well come from a biography:

> Byron, Augusta (the poet’s sister). See Leigh.
> 
> Byron, Augusta Ada (the poet’s daughter): paternal apostrophes to, 203, 219.

Canto III/I of _Childe Harold’s pilgrimage_, on page 203, opens thus:

> Is thy face like thy mother’s, my fair child!
> 
> Ada ! sole daughter of my house and heart?

(This last line despite ‘His daughter Allegra’ in the entry below for Byron, Lord. Allegra, alas, was illegitimate.)

> Byron, John, Commodore, afterwards Admiral (grandfather of the poet), incident of the destruction of his dog, 656. Further references to "my grand-dad’s" narrative, 656.

Page 656 contains nine stanzas of _Don Juan_, concerning a shipwreck, during which

> A small old spaniel – which had been Don Jose’s,
> 
> His father’s, whom he loved, as ye may think,
> 
> For on such things the memory reposes With tenderness – stood howling on the brink …
> 
> And Juan caught him up, and ere he stepp’d Off threw him in, then after him he leap’d.

The term ‘my grand-dad’ does not appear.

> Byron, Lord: His ancestry, their exploits, &c., 3, 4, 29, 30. (See Biren.) His daughter Allegra, 46. His fondness for the sea, 244. His poetic eulogium on Jeffrey, 765, 766. Autobiographical notes by him, 841, 885. His animosity against Jeffrey, 847, 848.

Page 46 offers the last four stanzas of ‘To the Earl of Clare’, and ‘Lines written beneath an elm in the churchyard of Harrow’. I can see no reference to Allegra or to a daughter on that page. The ‘Autobiographical notes’ on page 841 include the first three quoted above.

> Byron, Mrs. (the poet’s mother): "Childe Harold had a mother," 177

The relevant lines are

> Childe Harold had a mother – not forgot,
> 
> Though parting from that mother he did shun.

That’s all! There is no entry for mothers in the index (except for Mother Church); but nine stanzas of the first canto of _Don Juan_ give a detailed description of Juan’s mother, who makes further appearances later in the poem. Strangely selective indexing!

> Christianity quoted to sanction negro slavery, 902.
> 
> Curtis, Sir William, "in a kilt," 173. Harsh lines on him, 774.
> 
> Damaetas, 15. A portrait of the author’s self, 841.
> 
> English people, consequences of the beef-eating propensities of the, 667.
> 
> Enthusiasm, "a moral inebriety," 797.
> 
> Firmness, obstinacy, and pertinacity, convertible terms according to circumstances, 814, 815.
> 
> Gazelle, the, and its eyes; Oriental compliment deduced therefrom, 175. \[From To Ianthe\]
> 
> Hannibal: His exclamation on the successful march of Nero the Consul, 885.
> 
> Harvey’s odd mode of exhibiting his liking for Virgil, 852.
> 
> Jeffrey, Francis Lord, Edinburgh Reviewer, 112, 117. His duel with Moore, 117, 844, 848. "Pertest of the train," 117. "Literary anthropophagus," 124.
> 
> Poetic expression of Byron’s later feelings regarding him, 765, 766.
> 
> Julius Caesar, his baldness and means of concealing it, 239, 874. "Had Caesar known but Cleopatra’s kiss," 346. "The black-eyed Roman," 597. Suitor of love, 672.

On page 239, Canto CXLIV of _Childe Harold’s pilgrimage_ includes the lines

> The garland-forest, which the gray walls wear,
> 
> Like laurels on the bald first Caesar’s head;
> 
> Lawyers behold the baser side of life, 766.
> 
> Leigh, Hon. Augusta (Byron’s sister), verses addressed to ("The castled crag of Drachenfels"), 210. Stanzas to her, 88. Epistle to her, 89.
> 
> Martial, epigram from, 106. "Those nauseous epigrams," 631.

On page 631 we find stanzas from Canto 1 of _Don Juan._ An account in verse of the censorship to which all books studied by young Juan were subjected concludes:

> And then what proper person can be partial To all those nauseous epigrams of Martial?

Followed by stanza XLIV (which should much interest readers of this journal):

> Juan was taught from out the best edition,
> 
> Expurgated by learned men, who place Judiciously, from out the schoolboy’s vision,
> 
> The grosser parts; but, fearful to deface
> 
> Too much their modest bard by this omission,
> 
> And pitying sore his mutilated case,
> 
> They only add them all in an appendix,
> 
> Which saves, in fact, the trouble of an index;

The note to this final couplet reads:

> Fact! There is, or was, such an addition, with all the obnoxious epigrams of Martial placed by themselves at the end.
> 
> Mussulwomen, unintellectual condition of the, 622.
> 
> Obstinacy and firmness, convertible terms according to circumstances, 815.
> 
> Oysters, "amatory food," 668. "May be cross’d in love," 814.
> 
> "Pasiphae promoted breeding cattle," 667. .
> 
> Pertinacity. See Firmness.
> 
> Shaving, an entailed curse, 808.
> 
> Smoking, eulogy on, 347.
> 
> Vaccination, 640.

There is much fortuitous topical interest in that last entry! On page 640, canto CXXIX of _Don Juan_ proclaims:

> Vaccination certainly has been A kind antithesis to Congreve’s rockets,
> 
> With which the Doctor paid off an old pox,
> 
> By borrowing a new one from an ox.

But there is no note on Congreve’s rockets, for which a need might be felt.

> Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, Duke of. "His nose the hook where he suspends the world," 171.
> 
> Sarcastic allusions to him, 745, 753, 755, 786.
> 
> Extravagant title bestowed on him, 855.
> 
> "Wives in their husbands absences," 676.
> 
> Wordsworth, William, "mild apostate from poetic rule," 114. "Vulgar," and "simple," 122. His official employment, 626. Sharp remarks thereon,
> 
> 894\. His "Excursion", 625. "A drowsy, frowzy poem," 685. "Crazed beyond all hope," 648. His "Waggoners," 685. "Poet Wordy," 698. His genealogy of Carthage, 740, 899. See also 636, 650.

Sharp remarks on Wordsworth’s employment are indeed found on page 894, in a note on stanza VI of the dedication to _Don Juan:_

> Wordsworth’s place may be in the Customs – it is, I think, in that or the Excise – besides another at Lord Lonsdale’s table, where this poetical charlatan and political parasite licks up the crumbs with a hardened alacrity; the converted Jacobin having long subsided into the clownish sycophancy of the worst prejudices of the aristocracy,
> 
> Worms, "sad hungry Jacobins," 719.
> 
> Wrinkles, "the d---d democrats, won’t flatter," 767.

This is a fascinating index to read. Equally fascinating is the question – who compiled it? My eager attempts to discover the name of the indexer have all failed.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.26#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> Clearly, Byron himself wrote the notes, and no editor to the volume is named. Might we suppose that Byron himself devised the terminology for indexes to early publications of his poems, which were then repaginated for new editions through the subsequent century? (Byron died in 1824.) The index in the 1926 edition does show signs of being an author’s subjective index, with deliberately provocative style and assertions, and reinforcement there of the opinions expressed in the text.

I also possess the 1952 edition of Oxford University Press’s _The poetical works of Lord Byron._ This, too, names no editor – unlike all other Oxford Standard Authors volumes of poetry that I have seen. It has a note on the reverse of the title page:

> This edition of the Poetical Works of Lord Byron was first published in the Oxford Standard Authors series in July 1904; reprinted 1906, 1909, 1911, 1912, 1914, 1917 1921, 1923, 1926, 1928, 1929, 1933, 1935, and 1939. This reset edition was first printed in 1945, and reprinted in 1950, and 1952.

The reset edition preserves all the content of the original, including the notes, with different pagination – except that it omits the original index. It has an index of only five pages, headed INDEX OF TITLES AND FIRST LINES, with note, in parenthesis: _(The titles are printed in italics.)_, and contains entries of no further types. What a loss to the world of literature, to discard this truly fascinating index!

Despite contacting a number of Byron scholars, and the Byron Society, it has not been possible to ascertain who might have compiled this index.
