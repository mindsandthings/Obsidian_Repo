## Abstract

Indexes in ebooks can be ‘active’, with hyperlinks into the text. Should these links go to the page, paragraph, line or word level? This is a complex question, but the main concern may be the user interface in ebook reader applications. In this third article of a four-part series, Mary Coe and Jan Wright report on their investigation of how active ebook indexes are handled by applications on tablet devices. They conclude that ereader apps on tablet devices offer as much variation as browser-based reading apps and lack the consistency seen with dedicated ereader devices. (See the first article in this series in _The Indexer_ **37**(2), 125–40, for more on Web-based browser ereader applications, and the second article in _The Indexer_ **38**(1), 29–44, for more on dedicated ereader devices.) Due to the variety of operating systems, devices, and app versions on tablets, there were also many variables that could affect the ability of users to navigate within ebooks on tablets, and in particular to access the index.

## Introduction

Locators are fundamental components of indexes. In book indexes, they are usually page numbers, which means the reader must search a page’s worth of text to find the information; however, in ebooks, entries can be hyperlinked to the page, paragraph, line or word. When creating these active ebook indexes, what is the best practice for linking? Should we link entries to the page, paragraph, line or word level? This is a complex question for many reasons.

•

_Index users_ Until we have usability studies, we really do not know which location users would prefer, or whether they will notice the differences between these levels of precision. And, as we will see, users may have trouble predicting where the index links lead to in the text.

•

_Publisher and author preferences_ Publishers may dictate where the entries may be placed and may not understand the differences. Authors and editors may prefer to have entries placed in front of a term, only to find during revisions that it is hard to work around the index entries. Translators may also find it hard to work around coding that is placed in the middle of sentences and would prefer paragraph-level entries. The software prescribed by the publisher for indexing the book and placing the codes may not give the indexer a choice.

•

_Devices and ebook display software_ Perhaps most importantly, the devices and applications that we are using to read ebooks may not display our hyperlinked indexes in the most useful way for users.

Ebooks can be viewed on a stand-alone ebook reader, such as a Kindle or Nook, but they might also be displayed on another device, such as a personal computer (PC), tablet device or smartphone. Some ebooks are in a reflowable format, such as EPUB, which means that they adjust to fit the size of the screen being used. This is a useful feature, but it creates problems for the concept of a ‘page’. Obviously, a ‘page’ will not look the same on the small screen of a smartphone as it will on the large screen of a PC, nor will it have precisely the same amount of text as the print version. And, in order to read a book on any of these devices, the user will need an ebook reader application, which might display ‘pages’ differently. This might seem like a good argument for linking the index to a level other than the ‘page’ (such as to the paragraph, line, or word) as long as ebook reader applications recognize these subtle differences.

To test how ebooks are displaying targeted information from hyperlinked indexes, we created an ebook in Adobe InDesign Creative Cloud (CC) 2018, and converted it to EPUB2 with Calibre 3.37. We then created an Amazon Kindle-compatible file by using Amazon’s KindleGen. The public-domain books both have a hyperlinked index that is linked to several levels (page, paragraph, word). The first third of the book has entries linked to the top of the page’s display in print format, the second third has index entries linked to the beginnings of paragraphs, and the third part of the book has entries linked to the terms directly. Thus the index locators, when clicked, will take readers to less targeted or more targeted views of the wanted text, at least in theory. The ebook is a reflowable format, so the ‘page’ level was arbitrary and based on the presentation of the ebook in InDesign before it was converted to the EPUB and MOBI formats. We then tested the EPUB and MOBI files on several dedicated ereader devices to find out how they would handle the index links at various levels.

In the first article in this series (Coe and Wright, [2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#core-R1)), we looked at the entries as they were in the files that created the ebook and at how they displayed in personal-computer ereader applications and in Web-browser-based applications. In the second article, we looked at dedicated ereader devices (Coe and Wright, [2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#core-R2)), and in this third part, we will tackle tablet device applications.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> We originally planned to look at mobile devices (tablets and smartphones) at the same time, but the wide variety of applications and devices available led us to the conclusion that there was too much material for one article. Therefore, we will look at ereader apps on smartphones later in a fourth part to the series.

Focusing on tablet applications for ereading led to as much variation in display as the browser-based reading applications discussed in our first article. Due to the numbers of operating systems, devices and app versions, there are many variables that affect the performance of ereader apps. We found several apps that did not work, displayed the index poorly, and had navigational issues that would severely impact the user. We also found several apps that worked beautifully. For that reason, we have commented more on how the index was displayed, how it can be accessed, and general navigational issues with the apps discussed here.

Here are some of the navigational tools and features available to users in ebook reading apps on tablet devices:

•

_Page scroll_: buttons, swipe motions or taps that allow the user to move between pages.

•

_Table of contents (ToC)_: this can be produced in two ways:

1.

As a reproduction of the book’s ToC pages, i.e. if the book’s designer included a set of ToC pages, these are often reproduced in the ebook, and sometimes hyperlinked.

2.

If the book’s designer built the metadata for a ToC file (a special file that ereader apps can display independently of the ebook’s normal pages), this can be displayed quickly by a special feature in the app, usually by touching an icon.

•

_Search_: full-text search function, accessible by a special feature in the app, usually an icon. Some searches take the reader, location by location, through the text, but the most helpful search functions will display a screen with a snippet of text showing the context of the term at that location, allowing the reader to choose the most appropriate location.

•

_Index_: if the publisher includes a set of pages containing an index, it can be displayed in the ebook. If the publisher hyperlinks the index, it can act as aid in navigation. If not hyperlinked, the index can only suggest terminology for searching. A specially coded alphabetical navigation bar may also be displayed within the index that allows the user to jump to other sections of the index quickly.

•

_Progress bar_: a quick way for a reader to navigate to not-very-specific areas of the ebook. This is a good way to move around the book and could be used to get to the index at the back of the book quickly.

•

_X-ray features_: an Amazon feature on Kindles and Fires that can display either rudimentary search terms, or, if the publisher takes time to build metadata for X-ray, more nuanced and descriptive searching for a character or city. For more information about this feature see Wright ([2012](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#core-R3)).

•

_Bookmarking_: a way for the user to mark specific text of interest so that they can return to the section. In ebooks without metadata ToC, the user could build their own. The user could also bookmark the index or the reproduced ToC. Ereaders usually display the bookmarks as a list accessible from any screen.

•

_Last-visited page display_: a feature that allows the user to instantly return to the last page they viewed, potentially making it easier to navigate back to the index, particularly when following multiple locators.

•

_Hyperlinks_: found in the ToC and the index, these allow the user to quickly access specific portions of text.

Several of the applications we used on tablets did not display the metadata ToC (when one had been created), making it harder to access the index quickly. This fault forced us to use the page-scroll or progress bar to get to the back of the book instead. At least one app did not display a progress-bar feature, leaving us with only paging to get to the index. Small(ish) screen apps with differing features and navigational implementations mean relying on the metadata ToC very heavily to get to and from the index. Having a last-page-visited hyperlink also facilitates the use of the index. Snippets of text displayed in the Search feature allow not only text in the book to be found and analysed by the user, but also snippets of text in the index with the searched-for term to be found easily and judged.

## Index entry locations

To get a good idea of exactly where the entries are in the original files for the book, [Figures 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#F1) to [3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#F3) show the exact location of the entry codes (or markers, as they are called in InDesign). Markers in InDesign look like small blue arrows, allowing one to identify their location.

### Page level

This index entry for Joseph Acosta was linked to the top of the print page, right after the word ‘Chocolate’ in the title ([Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#F1)). This is page 15 in the book’s file. We are not using the page 16 hyperlink in this test.

> Acosta, Joseph, 15, 16

### Paragraph level

This index entry about the colour of roasted beans was linked to the beginning of the paragraph, in between the words ‘after’ and ‘roasting’ ([Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#F2)).

> cacao beans, colour of, roasted, 118

### Term level

This cocoa tea index entry was linked directly to the words in the text, right after the words ‘cocoa tea’ ([Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#F3)).

> cocoa tea, 147

## Tablets

We tried several ereader apps on an Apple iPad Mini, an Amazon Kindle Fire and an RCA Voyager. Overall, the Apple iPad Books app and the Kindle had the most navigational features available compared with the others we tried.

One thing that seemed to be a particular issue with the tablet displays was the index entry embedded at the page level at the end of a heading in the text (‘Derivation of chocolate’). In some cases, the heading was not displayed at all, and it is possible that embedding the entry at the beginning of the heading would solve this problem if displaying the heading is required, but this will require further testing. We note that the same heading was consistently displayed in the ereader and Web browser software on a PC and also in the dedicated ereader devices.

### Apple iPad Mini

We tried two apps specifically designed for use on Apple devices on an Apple iPad Mini running OS 12.4.60. Neither app handled the active locator links well. The Kindle for iPad app was haphazard about where it led users from the links into the text, and Apple iPad Books consistently displayed entry locations further down the screen, not at the top. And at the page level, neither of the apps displayed the relevant heading in the text in which the index entry was embedded.

We also wanted to try using the PocketBook app on the iPad Mini, but unfortunately it would not let us load the book. Its automatic scanning function did not find the files, and there was no manual way to load ebooks.

#### Kindle for iPad (version 6.22.0.100)

The Kindle for iPad app does use the metadata to build an easily accessible ToC available on every screen, making index access easy.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> The search shows snippets of text for the reader. It does not display a way to get to the last page visited. The index keeps the indents for second-level heads but loses them for the third. And, unfortunately, the app, unlike its dedicated ereader brethren, is haphazard about what it shows when one clicks the links.

The first locator in the Acosta index entry is linked to the _page level_, and the text as displayed in the Kindle for iPad app is shown in [Figure 4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#F4). Remember that the entry is embedded at the end of the ‘Derivation of chocolate’ heading, which does not appear on the screen; however, Acosta’s name, which was the relevant target for the entry, does appear. It is possible that embedding the entry at the beginning of the heading would solve this problem and display the heading if that were a relevant target.

The locator (118) in the following index entry is linked to the _paragraph level_; [Figure 5](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#F5) shows what is displayed in the Kindle for iPad app. This text is after the actual entry, and the entry location is on the previous screen.

Again, the app has shown text after the actual entry’s location, which is on the previous screen.

#### Apple iPad Books

The iPad Books app consistently displayed entry locations further down the screen, rather than the top. This will present a problem for users, who would have to scroll up a screen or read to the bottom of the screen to find the relevant information. iPad Books presents a nice metadata ToC, as well as bookmark finder, search with snippets of text showing, and notes finder. It does not display a way to get back to the last page visited.

The first locator in the Acosta index entry is linked to the _page level_, and the text as displayed on the iPad Mini is shown in [Figure 7](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#F7). Note that Acosta’s name does not appear on the screen. The iPad Books app displays the entry locations towards the bottom of the screen, not at the top. Embedding the entry in the heading ‘Derivation of chocolate’ causes the actual text reference to be hidden on the next screen, since the entry is not right next to the text that it refers to.

> Acosta, Joseph, 15, 16

The locator (118) in the following index entry is linked to the _paragraph level_; [Figure 8](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#F8) shows how the iPad Books app displays the text. The app tends to display entry locations slightly lower down on the screen, not at the top. This entry is embedded in the ‘After roasting’ paragraph. Having the entry closer to the text reference means that it is displayed, unlike the first example, but perhaps due to luck.

#### Amazon Fire tablet

The Amazon Fire tablet reads the standard Amazon MOBI and AZQ files. The images shown here are from a Kindle Fire 10 opening files in the native Kindle app. The Kindle Fire builds a ToC, it offers text snippets with search results, and it also displays a small icon offering the option to go back to the last viewed page. Overall, the app leads the user to an acceptable point in the text. The only problem appeared to be with the index entry that was embedded in the heading.

The first locator in the Acosta index entry is linked to the _page level_, and the text as displayed on the Fire tablet is shown in [Figure 10](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#F10). Remember that this entry was embedded in the heading, which is not displayed. Acosta’s name is about one-third of the way down the screen, but if the indexer was relying on the heading where the entry was actually embedded being shown, this would be disappointing. Also missing is the picture that follows Acosta’s entry.

### RCA Voyager Android tablet

The Voyager tablet runs Android 8.1.0. We downloaded four apps to view the book and the index: PocketBook, eReader Prestigio, AIReader and FullReader.

#### PocketBook (version 4.21)

PocketBook was the best reading experience on the Android tablet, but not perfect. It featured full-text search but did not show snippets, a metadata ToC, proper display of the index, or good navigational features that let users explore the book easily.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup> It displayed a quick way to get back to the last page visited. However, margin controls were missing, leaving the reader with the sense that the pages were cut off. Notice in the lower left of the images below that there is a large link that returns the user to their last viewed page, in this case, the index, allowing easy navigation.

For the most part, text was displayed from the locator links. However, we note that the heading containing the embedded locator at page level was not displayed and that the paragraph containing the paragraph-level entry was displayed in the middle of the screen, rather than at the top. The term-level entry was displayed near the top of the screen, but not exactly as the first line on display.

The first locator in the Acosta index entry is linked to the _page level_, and the text as displayed on the Android tablet is shown in [Figure 13](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#F13). Remember that this entry was embedded in the heading, which is not displayed. Acosta’s name is nearly at the bottom of the screen.

#### eReader Prestigio (version 6.3.4)

Prestigio displayed the metadata ToC, and the heading that contained the embedded locator at page level (unlike other apps, as we have noted above). Its full-text search showed snippets of text. Unfortunately, eReader Prestigio lost all indents in the index, which made it hard to use. However, it highlights the link one touches in color, which is a very nice feature not available in any other apps we have reviewed.

The first locator in the Acosta index entry is linked to the _page level_, and the text as displayed on the Android tablet is shown in [Figure 16](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#F16). Remember that this entry was embedded in the heading, which is displayed. Acosta’s name is above the picture.

#### AIReader (version 1.931910300)

AIReader was the most buggy of all the apps we investigated. It lost all indents in the index, and the book display was divided into an upper and lower screen, as shown in [Figure 19](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#F19). This made using the index nearly impossible. Search was available, but no snippets of text. A metadata ToC was displayed.

The first locator in the Acosta index entry is linked to the _page level_, and the text as displayed in the AIReader app is shown in [Figure 20](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#F20). Remember that this entry was embedded in the heading, which is not displayed. Acosta’s name is right above the picture.

#### FullReader (version 4.2.2)

The FullReader app made use of the metadata ToC, displayed the index properly with indents, but had a search that did not make use of snippets to help the reader, displayed ads in annoying places and froze the reader into a zone where no navigation was possible, forcing reboots.

The first locator in the Acosta index entry is linked to the _page level_, and the text as displayed in the FullReader app is shown in [Figure 23](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#F23). Remember that this entry was embedded in the heading and Acosta’s name is above the picture.

## Conclusion

As we have noted in previous articles in this series, although indexers have the capability to create hyperlinked indexes to various levels of text in an ebook, until ebook reader apps can handle these subtle differences, it can be a pointless exercise. The variety of displays in the ereader apps on tablets means that indexers cannot predict where on the screen their entry text will be displayed. In some cases, accurate locations were ignored and the text was not displayed at all. In many cases, mid-screen was the default. Indexers also cannot predict if the index will be preserved and displayed correctly, particularly in terms of indented heading levels. The navigational features available in ebooks on tablets may also directly affect the user’s ability to access the index. Features such as a metadata ToC, a last-page-visited hyperlink and index text displayed in search-result snippets give users ways to get to and from the index more easily. Overall, we have found that browser-based and tablet ereader apps showed wide variation in how the links from active ebook indexes are displayed. Dedicated ereader devices offered more consistency.

In the next article, we will investigate ebook reader apps on smartphones. In the meantime, we encourage you to use our active book index prototype with your own software and devices and let us know what you find.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.26#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup>

## Footnotes

2

Although we say that accessing the index through the table of contents was ‘easy’, we would still prefer to see an icon in the ereader app that would allow the user to go directly to the index. If anyone has seen such an icon, please get in touch!

3

PocketBook on the iPad Mini has all of these features too, but unfortunately we were not able to load the book to test it.

4

Note that the displayed text contains a hyphen (‘co-coa tea’) which has been inserted by the app. It disappears if the font size is changed. The justification of the text is also an app setting, and the user can adjust what they see.
