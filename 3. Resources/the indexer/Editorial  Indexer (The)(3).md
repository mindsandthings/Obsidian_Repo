Publication: The Indexer: The International Journal of Indexing

Volume 39, Number 3

I heard the sad news of Drusilla Calvert’s death just as this issue was going to the production team at Liverpool University Press. Drusilla and her husband, Hilary, designed and managed the MACREX indexing program, which has been a valuable tool for professional indexers for 40 years. Drusilla also played a key role in the Society of Indexers (SI) for many years, and was the driving force behind the original SI website. She will be missed by many in the indexing community worldwide. While we did not have time to include an obituary, we hope to include one in the next issue. If you would like to spend a few minutes reflecting on Drusilla’s contributions to the indexing community in the meantime, I recommend Geraldine Beare’s interview with her in the April 2004 issue of _The Indexer._<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.22#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup>

We started the last two issues with obituaries – Douglas Matthews (March 2021, **39**(1)) and Gale Rhoades (June 2021, **39**(2)) – and I cannot help but wonder if we are coming to the end of an era. These ‘indexers extraordinaire’ will be missed, but I am heartened to see many still going strong, such as Hazel Bell, who was editor of _The Indexer_ from 1978 to 1995. She has generously offered to reprise a regular feature that ran from 1991 to 2008 called ‘_The Indexer_ 30 years ago’. The series will start again in this issue but with an update as ‘_The Indexer_ 40 years ago’. I enjoyed Hazel’s look back at the content of the journal in October 1981, when indexers were entering the brave new world of the computer. This would have been about the same time that Drusilla and Hilary Calvert were creating the first version of the MACREX program. While we have come a long way since then with professional indexing software, many of the other articles in that issue will still strike a familiar chord. Hazel has also been busy examining the index to a 1926 edition of _The poetical works of Lord Byron_ and contemplating whether the poet was also the indexer. I hope you enjoy travelling back in time with Hazel in this issue, and I look forward to bringing you more from her in future.

Also in this issue, Melanie Gee and Paula Clarke Bain report on the peer review exercises run by the Society of Indexers, with Paula also including reflections on the role and purpose of indexes in more unusual texts like novels and comic fiction. In addition, Walter Greulich concludes his series on embedded indexing with Word, Max McMaster ponders how journal editors use indexes, and Jon Jermey reviews the PubIndex program. The indefatigable Ann Kingdom comes up with the goods yet again with detailed reports on National Indexing Day in the UK and the American Society for Indexing (ASI) conference. And you will find a report on the Association of Southern African Indexers and Bibliographers (ASAIB) conference and details of the Ewart-Daveluy Indexing Award presentation from the Indexing Society of Canada/Société canadienne d’indexation (ISC/SCI). Congratulations to Stephen Ullstrom for winning this award. He is also an active member of ISC/SCI and has contributed articles to this journal over the past couple of years. It is wonderful to see this next generation of indexers taking the helm.

Hazel Bell’s reflection on the October 1981 issue of the journal prompted me to pull out my print issue of it to have a closer look. The detailed index to that volume amazed me, and it was a timely reminder that we could do more with the index to _The Indexer_. I will be thinking more about this over the coming year, but for now I hope you will find the title and author indexes and list of ‘contents by category’ on _The Indexer_ website useful.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.22#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> A big thank you to Helen Taylor for keeping these updated as each new issue is published.
