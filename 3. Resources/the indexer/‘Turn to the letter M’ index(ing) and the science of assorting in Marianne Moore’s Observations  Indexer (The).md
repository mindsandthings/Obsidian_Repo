## Abstract

Readers and critics rarely consider the end-pages of texts, skipping over the indexes and flyleaves in favour of the poems themselves, and the same is true of the poet-authored index to Marianne [Moore’s 1924](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r32) _Observations_. To overlook Moore’s index, however, would be to (dis)miss its playful self-referentiality, the manner in which it works to simultaneously focus on, and distract from, the poems themselves. Taking Moore’s ‘Index’ to _Observations_ as a starting point for thinking about both the poetry and the problematics of Moore’s indexical experiments, the article begins by asking how the process of reading Moore’s index might simultaneously inform and distort the experience of reading _Observations_ itself, both for the reader and for Moore. In so doing, it considers the overlapping roles of reader and self-editor Moore that begins to play through the process of composing an index, revealing the manner in which (for reader and writer alike) the process of reading becomes one of selecting. Yet this process also becomes a process of dismantling and – implicitly – metonymizing, until the question becomes as follows: if poems are anatomized into a collection of constituent parts, can part lead back to whole? Far more than a marginal textual supplement, the index of _Observations_ forms a fundamental, if ultimately abandoned, part of Moore’s poetic experimentation, and one that allows us to reconsider the trajectory of Moore’s poetic career.

In the spring of 1925, readers of _The Dial_ magazine might have been forgiven for experiencing a sense of déjà vu. Between the months of January and April, four successive editorial ‘Comments’ turned to consider not new material, but rather Marianne Moore’s _Observations_, the newly published winner of the 1924 Dial Award ([Leavell, 2007](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r26): 71). The preoccupation was, of course, a mode of editorial practice-cum-promotion; as publisher of the collection, it was in the best interests of Scofield Thayer, editor of _The Dial_, to cement the connection between Moore and the magazine (see [Bazin, 2018](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r4)). _Observations_, Thayer remarks, presents ‘a literary species hitherto unrecorded’ – and, more particularly, ‘the literary species, the footnote species, of further aesthetic unfoldment’ ([Paul, 2002](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r38): 152). Within the pages of _Observations_, he theorizes, the form of the footnote is rendered not paratext but part of the poetry – a mode of ‘further aesthetic unfoldment’ – and since this initial remark, much has been made of the relation between Moore’s poetry and her ‘Notes’ (see, for instance, [Peterson, 1990](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r40); [Bazin, 2010](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r3)). It is perhaps unsurprising that Thayer chose the ‘Notes’ as his focus, given that it was due to his fervent encouragement that Moore chose to include them at all (Thayer, 1924, cited in [Schulze, 2002](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r44): 436). Yet in considering the plethora of paratextual manoeuvres found in _Observations_, Thayer ignores perhaps the most interesting of them: the 504-entry ‘Index’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup>

Skimming through the pages of _Observations_, it’s not hard to see how Thayer might have overlooked the ‘Index’, tucked as it is on the margins of the text between the ‘Notes’ and the end-pages. Yet to skip over Moore’s indexes as Thayer does would be to miss their playful self-referentiality, the manner in which they work to simultaneously focus on, and distract from, the poems themselves. Turn to H, for instance, and the reader finds:

> Habakkuk, 29
> 
> Hardy, Thomas, 48, 298
> 
> Hartman, C.B., 304
> 
> Harvard, glass flowers at, 71
> 
> Hawkins, Sir John, 78, 307<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup>

At first glance, the indexing seems relatively unremarkable – alphabetically ordered references to authors, places and prophets. Beneath this apparent uniformity, however, lies a latent eccentricity. At times, the outlandish juxtapositions of this alphabetical ordering create an acute comic edge, with philosophers such as ‘Bacon, Francis’ bookended by rather more practical ‘badger\[s\]’, ‘bat\[s\]’ and ‘baby rivers’ (_Collected Poems_, p. 81). Briefly commenting on some of these oddities in a review, Edward [Allen (2017b)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r2) concludes that ‘\[i\]t’s all the stuff of linguistic accident’, and it certainly seems so on the surface. Examine the ‘Index’ closely, however, and some of these instances begin to seem not so much accidental as intentional. Why, for instance, is ‘To a Prize Bird’ indexed under both ‘BIRD, TO A PRIZE’ and, later, under ‘PRIZE BIRD, TO A’,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup> when convention dictates that entries should be alphabetized according to the first letter of the main noun – in this case, bird (_Collected Poems_, p. 81)? It’s a small but telling inconsistency, and looked at in this light, it is difficult to avoid the sense that the ‘Index’ is founded upon deliberate oddities. Why bother indexing such a small moment as ‘blue jay’, a reference to a single line in ‘An Octopus’, particularly when the equally insignificant ‘harebells’ six lines earlier receive no such mention (_Collected Poems_, p. 75, ll. 146–52)? And likewise, why is the quotation ‘accessibility to experience’ indexed under the quotation itself, as opposed to its ostensible source: Henry James (‘Notes’, _Collected Poems_, p. 301)?<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup> Just like the seemingly demure ‘Miss Moore’, the ‘Index’ of _Observations_ belies its unassuming exterior to reveal a wry interior, a prismatic maze defying any hope of ‘neatness of finish’ (_Collected Poems_, p. 77, l. 206).

The fact that the present article is able to scrutinize the precise minutiae of _Observations_ at all is worthy of comment. Historically, Moore studies have been marked – and, arguably, hampered – by a distinct lack of textual resources; readers of Moore have long been limited to _Complete Poems_ (1967), an (in)famously _incomplete_ volume which omits nearly half of the poems Moore published prior to 1951 and forgoes _Observations_ entirely ([Paul, 2006](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r39): 429). Yet as Elizabeth Gregory and Stacy Carson Hubbard confidently asserted in 2018, recent years have heralded the blossoming ‘of a Moore renaissance’; and the publication of several scholarly editions which foreground the early publication history of Moore’s work has begun to correct this critical omission ([Gregory and Carson Hubbard, 2018](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r20): 2). Linda Leavell’s publication of a scholarly edition of _Observations_ in 2016, for instance, rendered a collection once largely unavailable accessible once more to the general reader.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup> Such a reissue owes much to Robin G. Schulze’s _Becoming Marianne_ [_Moore: the early poems, 1907–1924_](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r32) (2002), which reproduces facsimiles not only of _Observations_, but also of [Moore’s early poems published in little magazines, offering access to the multiple variants of poems written between 1907 and 1924](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r32) ([Schulze, 2002](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r44)). It is an insight into what Schulze calls ‘Moore’s poetics of radical instability’, and accordingly this focus on the evolving corpus of Moore’s work has necessitated a close paratextual focus ([Schulze, 1996](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r43)). Edward Allen’s recent article, ‘“Spenser’s Ireland,” December 1941: scripting a response’ (2017a), for example, scrutinizes unpublished letters and a series of reading scripts in order to consider the importance of ‘breath marks, slurs, inflections, caesura’ in the margins of ‘Spenser’s Ireland’, reading Moore’s revisionary tendencies as a type of vocal improvisation. This paratextual trend pervades recent criticism, underpinning Fiona Green’s treatment of Moore’s dyscalculia in her article ‘Moore’s numbers’ (2018) and Tara Stubbs’s lexicographic considerations in ‘Briefer mentions and lyrical lexicons: Marianne Moore’s responses to dictionaries in _The Dial_ and _Observations_’ (2020). For both Moore and the Moore scholar, poetry begins to blur into paratext, until considering one necessitates discussion of the other.

Despite the curious self-consciousness that echoes throughout the ‘Index’ to _Observations_, its contribution to the paratextual manoeuvres of Moore’s work has so far remained largely unscrutinized. So too has its contribution to the development of modernist poetry: Moore’s poet-authored ‘Index’, as Angela Carr notes, seems the clear precursor for Louis Zukofsky’s ‘Index of Names and Objects’ to his long poem ‘A’ (1978), an index which – with a hint of wit Moore would have approved of – includes only the indefinite and definite articles ‘a’, ‘an’ and ‘the’ ([Carr, 2021](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r7)).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn6" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn6">6</a></sup> Even the scattering of critics who address Moore’s ‘Index’ take a far more conservative approach than Zukofsky’s sardonic ‘Index of Names and Objects’ might suggest. Srikanth Reddy, who in a recent chapter takes the ‘Index’ to _Observations_ as a starting point for a discussion of Moore’s mode of digressing, concludes that ‘to create an alphabetical index to such a miscellany displays an extraordinary archival commitment to imposing order on one’s knowledge’ ([Reddy, 2012](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r41): 33) – a comment that seems to underline an interpretation of Moore entirely opposite to the eclectic figure found in contemporary Moore criticism. Natalia Cecire takes this one step further, discussing indexes and indexicality as a metaphor for Moore’s ‘precision’ yet bypassing the actual ‘Index’ entirely ([Cecire, 2011](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r10)). And despite dubbing the ‘Index’ ‘the key to understanding what Moore’s first readers found so refreshing about her poetics’, Allen leaves the remark there, so that the question of the ‘Index’ has since remained relegated to the footnotes of articles ([Allen, 2017b](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r2)).

It is a critical omission that the [Moore writing in 1967](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r35) might have approved of: while the ‘Notes’ present in _Observations_ become a defining characteristic of her later work, indexes disappear from subsequent publications, last appearing in this form in the 1925 reprint of _Observations_ ([Schulze, 2002](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r44): 36).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn7" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn7">7</a></sup> The only other instance of an index in [Moore’s corpus – the index included in the 1967](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r35) collection _Complete Poems_ – is a poor shadow of the one included in _Observations_, offering simply an ‘Index of Titles and Opening Lines’ with no mention of ‘bat\[s\]’ or ‘baby rivers’ (‘Original Tables of Contents’, _Collected Poems_, p. 442). Yet the ‘Index’ to _Observations_, self-questioning and self-conscious as it is, works to complicate the boundaries not just between poem and paratext, but crucially between Moore’s role as poet, reader and editor. This article, then, addresses the critical neglect of Moore’s ‘Index’ to _Observations_, taking Moore’s indexical challenge as a springboard to consider both the poetry and the problematics of this indexical approach.

At the heart of Moore’s ‘Index’, there lies a productive tension, and this article asks how the process of reading Moore’s ‘Index’ might simultaneously inform and distort the experience of reading the poems themselves, both for the reader and for Moore herself. In doing so, it considers the various and overlapping roles of reader and self-editor Moore begins to play through the process of composing an index – the manner in which (for reader and writer alike) the process of reading becomes one of ‘picking and choosing’, to borrow Moore’s phrase (_Collected Poems_, p. 48). Yet this same ‘picking and choosing’ also becomes a process of dismantling and – implicitly – metonymizing, until the question becomes as follows: if poems are anatomized into a collection of constituent parts, can part lead back to whole? Far more than a marginal textual supplement, the ‘Index’ of _Observations_ forms a fundamental, if ultimately abandoned, part of Moore’s poetic experimentation, and one that allows us to reconsider the trajectory of Moore’s poetic career.

_A_

## ‘accessibility to experience’, 55

On 16 December 1918, renowned poet Ezra Pound writes to a lesser-known Miss Moore, ostensibly to offer his advice. ‘Have you got a book of verse in print’, he asks, ‘and if not, can I get one into print for you?’<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn8" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn8">8</a></sup> Amidst Pound’s slightly self-important editorial suggestions, however, he pauses to detail the importance of a collection’s table of contents. ‘For what it is worth,’ he offers,

> my ten years or more of practice, failure, success, etc, in arranging tables of contents, is _à votre service_. Or at any rate unless you would have \[a\] definite scheme for a sequence, I would warn you of the very great importance of the actual order of poems in a booklet\[.\]

As opposed to being something arbitrary, Pound theorizes, there is a critical importance to what we might call the poetic architecture of a collection of poetry – the ordering and sequencing of poems – and in writing to Moore, he offers his services to facilitate the creation of such a table of contents. In considering this letter, however, my focus here is not on the relationship between Pound and Moore, but instead on the prescriptive advice the older poet offers: this so-called ‘definite scheme for a sequence’.

Attention to the precise ordering of poems in a table of contents is not something that seems to have occupied Moore previously. Writing to Harriet Monroe, founder and editor of the literary magazine _Poetry_, three years earlier, Moore concludes: ‘\[u\]nless you object, I should like to use as a title for my poems, “Tumblers, Pouters and Fantails”; and I like the order in which you have arranged the poems’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn9" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn9">9</a></sup> Here, titles apparently take precedence over structure, with the poet somewhat off-handedly leaving the ordering up to Monroe. Whether Moore might have wished to rectify this oversight in her first published collection, _Poems_ (1921), the affair was rendered a matter outside her control when novelist and friend Bryher published a collection without Moore’s formal consent ([Schulze, 2002](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r44): 23). Moore’s control over her own textual presentation had been abruptly stripped from her, and in a letter to Bryher following the collection’s publication, the poet writes that while ‘touched by the beauty of all the printing details’, ‘\[she\] wouldn’t have the poems appear now if \[she\] could help it and … would make certain changes’ (_Selected Letters_, p. 164).

[Moore’s opportunity to make these ‘certain changes’ was to come three years later with the 1924](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r32) publication of _Observations_ by The Dial Press, a moment that heralded the first substantial control she had over the textual presentation of her own poems. Given her experience in 1921, which Robin G. [Schulze (2002](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r44): 25) dubs ‘the realization of Moore’s worst nightmares of exposure’, [Moore declined multiple invitations to publish between 1921](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r31) and 1923. It was to take a personal plea from Scofield Thayer, editor of _The Dial_, in 1924 before Moore finally ventured back into the world of print. But Thayer was working to a tight deadline, and Moore was pressed to produce a workable manuscript immediately ([Schulze, 2002](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r44): 30–4). Notations in Moore’s own copy of _Poems_, held at the Rosenbach Museum and Archive,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn10" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn10">10</a></sup> show the poet using the text as a base, meticulously – and presumably quickly – editing commas and hyphens, adding missing articles, adjusting titles, and at times omitting poems entirely. Yet _Observations_ is a volume that, as [Allen (2017b)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r2) observes, ‘plays with paratexts’, and alongside this small-scale editorial work, Moore also performed larger paratextual changes, adding both the now famous ‘Notes’, which offered sources for quotations and references, and – crucially – an ‘Index’. In the alphabetically ordered space of the ‘Index’, the newly arranged table of contents finds itself dismantled, dissected, reordered: generating order amidst disorder. It is not quite the ‘definite scheme’ Pound envisioned.

_B_

## Bacon, Francis, circular traditions, 63, 303

That Moore, constrained by such strict deadlines, nonetheless took the time to compose an index lends the moment a distinct importance; and one of the first questions we might ask is how an index might differ from a table of contents. Composed of a list of labels usually followed by page numbers, a table of contents provides a metonymic summary of a volume: an abbreviated account from which we might glean a sense of the whole (see [Howley, 2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r22)). More than just a summary, however, tables of contents also work as a mode of sequencing. Even without page numbers, Dennis Duncan theorizes, a table of contents ‘provides an overview of a work’s structure: it follows the ordering of the text, revealing its architecture’ ([Duncan, 2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r15): 265). It is a ‘scheme for a sequence’, imposing an indication of the linear order in which each poem is to be encountered.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn11" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn11">11</a></sup> ‘There is something attractive’, Moore writes in ‘People’s Surroundings’, ‘about a mind that moves in a straight line’ (_Collected Poems_, p. 56, l. 31). And to read _Observations_ from start to finish according to the table of contents is to follow the trajectory of the collection in a straight line.

Yet if the table of contents is the movement of a mind in a straight line, the index by contrast might be said to be the movement of a mind in zigzags. The _Oxford English Dictionary_ describes it as ‘an alphabetical list, placed (usually) at the end of a book, of the names, subjects, etc. occurring in it, with indication of the places in which they occur’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn12" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn12">12</a></sup> Such a definition, however, proves misleading. The very act of ordering the index alphabetically renders it a kind of random-access technology; its principal innovation ‘is in severing the relationship between the structure of the works and the structuring of the table’ ([Duncan, 2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r15): 265). So while the index possesses the same page locators as the table of contents, it simultaneously dismantles the fixed schematic of the table of contents, instead allowing the reader to move between poems radially as opposed to linearly – from ‘Picking and Choosing’ to ‘Snakes, Mongooses, Snake-Charmers and the Like’, and back again, in the case of _Observations_. It is a piece poised on the intersection between order and disorder, a kind of sanctioned anarchy.

In its essence, the index is a paratextual manoeuvre that indulges Moore’s penchant for playfulness – a liminal, hybrid form on the threshold between two states of being – and it is this odd duality that marks the entries themselves. Indexes for books of poetry conventionally provide an alphabetical catalogue of titles and first lines, as with Moore’s ‘Index of Poems and Opening Lines’ in the 1967 _Complete Poems_, while those that stray into subject matter work to abridge primary material into a collection of keywords, predominantly composed of nouns. Put simply, the basic principles of indexing rest in what Duncan (forthcoming) calls ‘abstraction and arrangement’: condensing information into primary ideas in order to save the reader time.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn13" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn13">13</a></sup> [Moore’s 1924](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r32) ‘Index’, however, radically diverges from this established system of indexing:

> Baxter, Richard, as high as deep,
> 
> 65, 304; illusion of, 65, 303;
> 
> irritating things, 30, 298; like
> 
> happy souls in Hell, 75, 307;
> 
> past states, 65, 303; unlike
> 
> flesh, 64, 303; seldom and
> 
> cold, 67, 304

(_Collected Poems_, p. 81)

At first glance, the entry appears to conform to the norms of indexing – ‘Baxter, Richard’ is a proper noun, referring to Richard Baxter, the English Puritan poet, hymnodist and theologian.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn14" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn14">14</a></sup> The entries that follow, however, are not abbreviated keywords, but rather lines of verse. Borrowed both from her own poem and from the source material – Baxter’s ‘The Saints’ Everlasting Rest’ (‘Notes’, _Collected Poems_, p. 303) – the entries ‘illusion of’, ‘irritating things’, and ‘like happy souls in Hell’ are drawn directly from the poems, so that you might read the entries as lines of poetry themselves. And, as if to complicate the matter further, the phrases equally seem to function as quasi-summaries of concepts; read with a particularly cynical gaze, ‘happy souls in Hell’ might indeed seem to provide a summary of ‘Marriage’. As opposed to being arbitrary, these indexical anomalies prove pivotal to our understanding of the ‘Index’ to _Observations_, signalling Moore’s departure from traditional index-making to a far more experimental understanding of indexing.

Briefly commenting on what she terms ‘the wild heterogeneity’ of Moore’s ‘Index’ to _Observations_ in her introduction to Moore’s _Collected Poems_, Heather Cass White concludes it to be ‘impish’: that is, playful, puckish and, crucially, flippant (‘Introduction’, _Collected Poems_, p. xx). Such a conception is a familiar refrain in Moore criticism: the poet is often pigeonholed as being quirky, and, by extension, unserious. Far more than just proving merely amusing idiosyncrasies, however, such indexical anomalies have wide-ranging implications for Moore’s theorization of indexes as a whole. Take, for instance, the entries under ‘A’:

> Adam, exonerated, 64; power of, 76
> 
> Adam and Eve, 63; in the days of, 44
> 
> Adam’s experiment, 66

(_Collected Poems_, p. 81)

By definition, an index is the epitome of parataxis: grounded in arbitrariness, its alphabetic ordering presents not nonsense, per se, but rather non-sense. Here, however, Moore’s ‘Index’ begins to complicate this strict binary between sense and non-sense. Previously a collection of assorted entries, the lines reform themselves when scrutinized to reveal something that reads oddly like a unit of sense: ‘power of Adam and Eve in the days of Adam’s experiment’. This sense is only complicated by Moore’s habit of indexing lines from poems. ‘Power of Adam’, ‘in the days of Adam and Eve’ and ‘Adam’s experiment’ are not keywords, but rather lines borrowed from Moore’s own poems – ‘An Octopus’, ‘In the Days of Prismatic Colour’ and ‘Marriage’ respectively – and the lines almost read as a poem in their own right (_Complete Poems_, p. 76, l. 185; p. 44, l. 1; p. 66, l. 136).

On closer scrutiny, it is not altogether clear whether the entries actually proceed alphabetically. If ordered according to alphabetical precedents, the entries would read:

> Adam, exonerated, 64; power of, 76
> 
> Adam’s experiment, 66
> 
> Adam and Eve, 63; in the days of, 44

‘Power of Adam’s experiment Adam and Eve in the days of’ resists being read as a unit of sense, no matter how much you try, and the alphabetic discrepancy lends the moment a playful intentionality. It is an example of order in the midst of disorder: semantic logic where ordinarily none is found. This is not to say that such an idea is true of the entire ‘Index’: at times, the entries do read simply as lists of objects, as ‘C’, with its collection of ‘cockatrices, 61, 302 | cockroaches, 40’ and ‘coffin\[s\]’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn15" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn15">15</a></sup> But by inviting such a misreading, even if only for a second, the ‘Index’ begins to challenge accepted literary conventions, problematizing the conventional definition of poetry. To what extent can the ‘Index’ be deemed to be a poem? And if not, why is this? What precisely constitutes a poem?

Paratext blurs into poem, and it is easy to see traces of this kind of poetic and paratextual slippage in the experience of reading the ‘Index’ in its entirety. ‘Glance down the jagged columns’, [Allen (2017b)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r2) suggests, ‘and you’ll spot juxtapositions that must seem as merciless as they do mirthsome’. Yet this is not all you spot: the jagged columns very much resemble those of Moore’s early syllabic experiments, in poems such as ‘The Fish’:

> wade
> 
> through black jade.
> 
> Of the crow-blue mussel-shells, one
> 
> keeps
> 
> adjusting the ash-heaps;
> 
> opening and shutting itself like
> 
> an

The wavering lines of the ‘Index’, splintered into fragments, visually mimic the syllabic form of the poems they reference, requiring the eye, to borrow the words of ‘The Fish’, to ‘move themselves with spotlight swift | -ness | into the crevices’. And, just like ‘The Fish’, the ‘Index’ employs its own off-rhymes, as with the repeated stressed consonant of ‘b’ in

Far more than remaining merely a paratextual supplement, the ‘Index’ to _Observations_ performs its own mode of poetics, echoing the rhythmic cadences of the poems themselves.

As the ‘Index’ of _Observations_ problematizes the accepted definitions of poetry, it also begins to question the reading experience, encouraging a mode of radial, as opposed to linear, reading. Historically, indexes were not always associated with the backmatter of a book: William Caxton’s edition of the _Legenda aurea sanctorum_ (1483), as [Duncan (2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r15): 271) remarks, prints the table of contents and the index one after the other. After the late sixteenth century, however, indexes shifted from front to back, and nowadays the table of contents and the index usually function instead as a pair of paratextual bookends, one opening and the other closing the text (Duncan, forthcoming). ‘More than a boundary or a sealed border,’ writes Gerard [Genette (1997](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r17): 1–2), the ostensible forefather of paratextual criticism, ‘the paratext is, rather, a threshold, or … a “vestibule”’, forming a kind of entry and exit point to the text at hand’. But if we are to accept this logic, then Moore’s ‘Index’ presents a curious kind of egress. Instead, weighing in at 504 entries and ten pages, the ‘Index’ seems more like something through which the reader might laboriously ‘wade’ – an egress that prevents exit ([Schulze, 2002](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r44): 153). This is not the extent of the distorting potentialities of an index, however. By virtue of their being, indexes subvert the accepted convention of front-to-back reading: as opposed to beginning with the table of contents, the reader has the option to begin at the back, to read backwards from the index as opposed to forwards from the title page. They are exit and entry simultaneously, enabling a mode of disruptive reading.

Under ‘B’ in the ‘Index’ to _Observations_, the reader finds the following entry: ‘Bacon, Francis, circular traditions, 63, 303’. On the one hand, the entry is unremarkable, referencing the following moment in ‘Marriage’: ‘of circular traditions and impostures, | committing many spoils’ (_Collected Poems_, p. 63, ll. 14–15). Looked at in light of the oblique experience of reading Moore’s ‘Index’, however, the comment begins to sound characteristically wry. Look up ‘LUNATIC’, for example, and the reader finds not a reference to a poem, but rather a reference to another entry in the ‘Index’ itself: ‘LUNATIC, see FOOL’ (_Collected Poems_, p. 85). The ‘Index’ directs the eye not out onto the poems, but rather back into its own internal maze, offering further confusion in the place of clarity. This is far from the only instance of this mode of topographical confusion in Moore’s ‘Index’. Instead, entries often list both the page number for the poem in question and the page number for the relevant page in the ‘Notes’, as with ‘PAST IS THE PRESENT, THE, 29, 297’ (_Collected Poems_, p. 86). That is, the reference directs the attention forwards to the poem ‘The Past is the Present’ and simultaneously backwards to the ‘Notes’, the eye caught in two contradictory directions at once. ‘The quality of satisfaction gathered from reading \[Moore\]’, writes William Carlos Williams in 1925, ‘is that one may seek long in those exciting mazes sure of coming out the right door in the end’ ([Williams, 1932](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r50): 538–9). Despite identifying the maze-like qualities of Moore’s work, Williams nonetheless reads _Observations_ as a maze with a denouement – a labyrinthine experience that ultimately culminates in clarity. By contrast, the present article reads Moore’s ‘Index’ as the (para)textual equivalent of ‘glass that will bend’: a fun-house mirror of a threshold that inevitably sends you back to the start – or, to borrow the words of ‘An Octopus’, where, ‘completing a circle, | you have been deceived into thinking you have progressed’ (_Collected Poems_, p. 72, ll. 23–4).

The circuitous experience of reading Moore’s ‘Index’ leads to an assumption that such indexical inconsistencies are as much accidental as intentional. Yet a glance at Moore’s employment history complicates this assumption. From 1921 to 1925, Moore was employed as an assistant librarian at the Hudson Park Branch of the New York Public Library, and while relatively little is known about her work, her duties would have necessitated an awareness of cataloguing systems – as Srikanth Reddy notes, the time in which Moore worked as a librarian was an ‘extended “missionary period” of library reform marked by the introduction of reference service’([Reddy, 2012](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r41): 37).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn17" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn17">17</a></sup> Yet Moore’s familiarity with archival procedures began earlier still, as Louise [Collins (1990](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r12): 53–4) makes clear. In 1920, Moore was employed at Melvil Dewey’s Lake Placid Club in upstate New York, confiding to her brother in 1910 that her work involved ‘proof reading … private secretary work, and filing of statistics or information’ for Dewey ([Collins, 1990](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r12): 54). While she was there, she would have witnessed first-hand Dewey’s groundbreaking public project of archival arrangement. The experience was not for her, and [Collins (1990](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r12): 60) credits it with convincing Moore that ‘she would not like working at a stenographic job’. Nonetheless, it represents her first sustained exposure to a complex indexical and archival system, and thus it is difficult to dismiss the incongruities scattered throughout Moore’s ‘Index’ as simply evidence of Moore’s ignorance concerning the intricacies of indexing. That Moore imbues her ‘Index’ with a playful circularity implies, instead, that such indexical aberrations form an essential part of her aesthetic framework.

Just as Moore’s ‘Index’ sends you in circles, it also sends you leaping between the poems themselves, zigzagging erratically between titles. Tracing the list of entries under the letter ‘A’, for instance, the eye stumbles across the following entry: ‘Alps, crossing the, 48; shadows of, 59’ (_Collected Poems_, p. 81). Readers interested in ‘Alps, crossing the’ should turn to page 48 and the poem ‘Picking and Choosing’ – where ‘… rushed, Caesar crossed the Alps on the “top of a | diligence”’ (_Collected Poems_, p. 48, ll. 24–5), a quotation that then directs the eye back to the ‘Notes’. For readers instead curious about ‘Alps … shadows of’, page 59 refers to the poem ‘Snakes, Mongooses, Snake-Charmers and the Like’ and the line ‘one is compelled to look at it as at the shadows of the alps’ (_Collected Poems_, p. 59, l.19). Ordinarily, there would be no cause to read or indeed consider ‘Picking and Choosing’ and ‘Snakes, Mongooses, Snake-Charmers and the Like’ in conjunction with one another. Read sequentially, the two poems are separated by seven poems and roughly 300 lines, and by the time the reader gets to ‘Snakes, Mongooses, Snake-Charmers and the Like’, only the faintest memory of ‘Picking and Choosing’ remains. Within the space of the ‘Index’, however, the two poems are brought into close proximity and, once they are looked at in this light, something curious occurs. The Alps that shadow ‘Snakes, Mongooses, Snake-Charmers and the Like’ become overlaid by the memory of ‘Caesar’ (_Complete Poems_, p. 48, l. 24); the reference to ‘the essentially Greek, the plastic animal all of a piece’ recalls ‘Xenophon’, the ancient Greek historian, philosopher and soldier, from ‘Picking and Choosing’ (_Complete Poems_, p. 59, l. 17; p. 48, l. 29). The unexpected indexical pairing encourages the reader to dismantle the conventional ordering of the poems, to read familiar poems anew.

As opposed to the strict separation between poems enforced by the table of contents, Moore’s ‘Index’ blurs the boundaries between poems, rendering fixed forms malleable. Indexed entries often bring together multiple different poems, as with the entry: ‘jade, black, 39; cockroaches, 49; water, 61’ (_Collected Poems_, p. 84). Here, the poems ‘The Fish’, ‘England’ and ‘Novices’ are each dissected and indexed in terms of jade – respectively black jade, jade cockroaches and jade water – and discussing this miscellaneous grouping of disparate elements, [Paul (2006](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r39): 424) concludes that it reveals ‘connections among several poems’. More than just connection, however, these combinations offer a means of reassembly. The viscous sea of ‘black jade’ through which the eponymous ‘fish | wade’ in ‘The Fish’, for instance, flows and freezes into the ‘jade cockroaches’ of ‘England’, preserved alongside ‘its rock crystal’, dissolving once more into the ‘solution’ of ‘the jade and the rock crystal’ of ‘Novices’, the poems mingling and overlapping with one another (_Collected Poems_, pp. 39, 49, 61). By dissecting the poems, the ‘Index’ equally asks how they might fit back together again, until the poems begin to seem not separate but rather coextensive, laying claim to a shared sea of association.

Just as the ‘Index’ works to distort the reading practices of the reader, however, it begins to complicate those of Moore too, blurring the boundaries between poet and reader. Copies of Moore’s published collections held at the Rosenbach show Moore routinely reading and annotating her own work; her copy of _Collected Poems_ (1961) is extensively annotated, in terms of both correcting typos and making revisions. It is precisely this habit of reading her own work that would have served Moore well in the process of creating the ‘Index’, for it is more than merely an index of first lines and titles. Instead, it includes subject matter, both large and small, and in the process of preparing it, Moore would have had to trawl through the poems once more, ‘picking and choosing’ precisely what to index.

At heart, then, Moore’s ‘Index’ is a process of reading as much as it is a process of writing, and crucially one of disjointed reading. Moore’s notebooks bear evidence of the fact that many of her poems began life on the same page – in the earliest of Moore’s extant poetry notebooks, drafts of ‘Marriage’ intertwine with those of ‘An Octopus’, forming one long poem before ultimately dividing into two.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn18" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn18">18</a></sup> Other poems, however, had no reason to be thought of in conjunction with one another, as with ‘Poetry’ and ‘People’s Surroundings’. ‘Poetry’ was first published alongside ‘Black Earth’, ‘The Fish’, ‘Dock Rats’ and ‘England’ in Alfred Kreymborg’s (1920) _Others for 1919_ anthology, while ‘People’s Surroundings’ first appeared in the June 1922 issue of _The Dial_; neither their composition dates nor their publication histories place the two poems into any sort of association ([Schulze, 2002](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r44): 205, 269). In the space of the ‘Index’, however, the entry ‘bat, root, 67; upside down, 30’ forces the two poems into abrupt proximity. It is old news that ‘Poetry’ is Moore’s most explicitly metapoetic poem – Bonnie [Honnigsblum (1990](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r21): 188) goes so far as to call it a ‘poetic manifesto of sorts’. With ‘People’s Surroundings’ indexed alongside ‘Poetry’, however, one might begin to read the former as a further metapoetic interrogation. Ostensibly a discussion of the manner in which one’s setting might provide an indication of internal character, ‘People’s Surroundings’ radically alters when one considers how these surroundings might also be the framework of quotations embedded throughout the poem. Concrete topography blurs into poetic topography, the poem rendered a meditation on Moore’s poetic practice. Here, Moore is finding corollaries as a reader, the act of reading complicating the established poetic arrangement. The ‘Index’ becomes a documentation of Moore on Moore: Moore reading her work and reflecting on her own practices of reading and writing.

As for readers, so for Moore, the presence of an index proves pivotal, and to attend to these kinds of indexical propensities is to discover that _Observations_ is far from the only manifestation of such tendencies. Instead, as Grace Schulman finds, this indexical habit in _Observations_ is mirrored by an indexical trend in Moore’s own private reading. ‘In one of the \[reading\] notebooks’, Schulman writes,

> a converted address book whose organizing labels of ‘Name’, ‘Street’, ‘City’ and ‘Telephone’ she ignored for her purpose, \[Moore\] made alphabetical indexes to the quotations, anecdotes, jokes and drawings found in the notebooks. A few of the entries listed under M, for instance, in one book, are: ‘Machiavelli; MacKenzie; K. Mansfield; Marriage; Masefield; Maugham; Mayran; Medieval Mind; Men vs. Women’\[.\] ([Schulman, 1990](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r42): 33)<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn19" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn19">19</a></sup>

Akin to the ‘Index’ in _Observations_, the list is composed of an eclectic mix of nouns, proper nouns and what might be best called subject headers – ‘Medieval Mind’, ‘Men vs. Women’ and so on. As opposed to the published ‘Index’ of _Observations_, however, this is a personal index for Moore’s eyes only – a guide to the mental architecture underpinning the processes of her own notetaking – and such indexing has a curious effect on the normally unconscious act of reading. Once unobserved, the movements of Moore’s mind are mapped within the space of the index, her process of reading recorded. The ‘Index’, in other words, is rendered a means of documenting and thus interrogating the process of writing and reading. How do we read? And how do we select what to read?

## CHOOSING, PICKING AND, 48, 298

So far, we have considered the manner in which the ‘Index’ to _Observations_ dismantles the immediate experience of reading for reader and poet, demanding a twofold dissection of the reading and writing process. More expansively, however, this indexical poetics ultimately becomes a commentary on the cognitive process of reading, suggesting how reading might demonstrate, as Moore writes in a notebook, the ‘fretwork of the mind’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn20" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn20">20</a></sup> A good starting place here is the experience of reading _Observations_. Critics and readers alike have commented at length on what Elizabeth [Bishop (1984](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r5): 123) calls the ‘dazzling’ qualities of the collection – the manner in which it is, as Cass White remarks, ‘seldom easy to see what a Moore poem as a whole is about, even when it comes with a seemingly straightforward title’ (‘Introduction’, _Collected Poems_, p. xix). Take the lengthy ‘An Octopus’, for instance. Measuring in at 227 lines, the poem is one of the longest in the collection, a length you might reasonably expect to be divided into stanzas. Yet ‘An Octopus’ instead forms a single stanza, and without the respite of the strip of white page between stanzas, the attention quickly becomes overwhelmed by the density of information: in the 1924 edition of _Observations_, the poem spans seven pages. Thrown from noun to noun, the reading eye becomes, to borrow the words of ‘An Octopus’, ‘concealed in the confusion’, skipping over multiple points of focus. ‘If clarity allows us to see better,’ Heather Cass White notes, then Moore’s ‘dazzlement, however exciting, may mean we can hardly see at all’ (‘Introduction’, _Collected Poems_, p. xix).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn21" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn21">21</a></sup>

Where the original poem presents multiple points of focus, however, the ‘Index’ instead favours a far more streamlined response. The 227 lines of ‘An Octopus’ are reduced to approximately 70 entries, including everything from ‘antelope\[s\]’ to ‘Hell, in’. As opposed to trawling through seven pages and 227 lines, this indexical compression allows the reader to simply follow the reference of, say, ‘Adam, power of’ and flick to the line ‘such power as Adam had and we are still devoid of’, proceeding through ‘An Octopus’ from there (_Complete Poems_, p. 76). In doing so, the ‘Index’ enables a mode of selective attention – the reader can pick out points of focus to the exclusion of all else. ‘The eye knows what to skip’, ‘People’s Surroundings’ proposes (_Complete Poems_, p. 57). But the ‘Index’ takes this one step further, not only telling the eye what to skip, but lending it the navigational framework to do so.

The matter of encouraging the reader to skip and self-edit material – either deliberately or otherwise – bears meaningfully upon the mode of reading Moore’s _Observations_, and here it is helpful to consider an early review of Moore by William Carlos Williams. ‘With Moore’, Williams writes, ‘a word is a word most when it is separated out by science, treated with acid to remove the smudges, washed, dried and placed right side up on a clean surface’. For Moore, he continues, ‘\[t\]here must be edges. … There must be recognizable edges against the ground which cannot … be left entirely white’ ([Williams, 1932](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r50): 391). Where prose would be composed entirely of a solid mass of black print, Williams instead conceives of Moore’s poetry as built on planes of dissection, along which poems might be anatomized and reformed.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn22" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn22">22</a></sup> ‘All readers of Moore’, as Allen claims in response to the publication of Cass White’s _Collected Poems_, ‘are wont to become editors – the process of piecing together an edition is an “evaluative act”’; before beginning to write at all, the critic must first choose which version of a poem to write about ([Allen, 2017b](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r2)). But the question that is asked less often – and the one the ‘Index’ makes all the more resonant – is the extent to which this editorial practice is an act that Moore actively facilitates, with the ‘Index’ working to disrupt accepted modes of reading. ‘Novices’, Moore writes, ‘anatomize their \[own\] work’ (_Complete Poems_, p. 61). But might experts instead allow others to anatomize them?

Moore’s manifold interests often manifest themselves in the collections of clippings she left behind her, and among the various assorted pieces of paper in the extensive Marianne Moore archive held at the Rosenbach, an underlining in a newspaper cutting catches the eye. Entitled ‘Rebel with a camera’, the _New York Times_ article in question concerns the photographic practices of Alfred Stieglitz, and on the second page, Moore has carefully underlined in red pencil: ‘the \[a\]esthetic basis of art is selection’ ([Sweeney, 1947](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r48): 21). As sardonic as the underlining might seem after trawling through Moore’s extensive archive, however, the moment allows an important insight into Moore’s mode of indexical poetics. Art, the comment implies, is the process of selecting as much as creating, a process of combining and recombining disparate elements to form a new whole: a kind of readerly assemblage.

Moore, in other words, was thinking about the place of the reader in the creation of a text – the manner in which a reader might pick and choose material – and in this light, I want to consider one of Moore’s editorial ‘Comments’, published for _The Dial_ in 1927:

> Academic feeling, or prejudice possibly, in favour of continuity and completeness is opposed to miscellany – to music programs, composite picture exhibitions, newspapers, magazines, and anthologies. Any zoo, aquarium, library or garden, however, is an anthology, and certain of these selected findings are highly satisfactory. (Quoted in [Willis, 1987](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r52): 182–3)

Like Pound, the poetic world apparently favours singularity over assortment – a singular scheme for a work, as opposed to multiple threads. But here Moore outlines her irritation with the view that there is no inherent value to be found in the miscellaneous, the variegated. Crucially, however, Moore’s focus is equally on the cognitive implications of such works. ‘However expressive the content of an anthology’, she suggests, ‘one notes that a yet more distinct unity is afforded in the unintentional portrait given of the mind which brought the assembled integers together’. No matter how disparate the content of the anthology, that is, cohesion is nonetheless provided by the logic of the mind (or minds) who selected them. For, as Tara Stubbs notes, ‘it is useful to recall here that – etymologically at least – “anthology” means “a gathering of flowers”, in the manner of a commonplace book, of which Moore kept many’ ([Stubbs, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r47): 202). Just like an index, an anthology is a gathering of assorted and disparate material, and for both, the question becomes one of who precisely ‘picks these “flowers” and gathers them together’ ([Stubbs, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r47)): whose mind does this gathering become a portrait of?

For far more than merely a singular ‘portrait … of a mind’, Moore’s ‘Index’ allows for the possibility of multiple modes of reading. _Observations_, according to the table of contents, is composed of 54 poems. Within the space of the ‘Index’, however, these 54 poems are dismantled into 504 entries: 504 possibilities for reassembly, 504 possible ways of reading the poems. Pound, as we have seen, insisted on a fixed order for collections of poetry: a singular sequence in which to definitively encounter works, and, accordingly, a singular scheme in which to interpret them. But if Pound gestures towards the need for a ‘definite scheme’, then _Observations_ presents something distinctly more ‘prismatic’ (_Collected Poems_, p. 44). Under the alphabetic gaze of the ‘Index’, poems are refracted, dismantled, left open to be re-formed once more; and with the kaleidoscopic influence of the ‘Index’ still distorting the vision, I want to consider how this poetic refraction might impact upon and complicate conventional modes of reading.

What proves significant here is a consideration of Moore’s curious mode of indexing. The inclusion of an index in _Observations_ is already something of an oddity: conventionally, books of poetry did not tend to provide an index. Those that provided an index at all tended to provide only an index of first lines and titles, as with Moore’s later volume _Complete Poems_ (1967). In direct contrast to this minimalist tradition, however, Moore’s ‘Index’ to _Observations_ references poems both by titles and by subject matter, so that one poem might generate multiple subject references – in the case of ‘An Octopus’, approximately 70. These entries incorporate a myriad of details, from the smallest ‘goat\[s\]’, ‘blue jay\[s\]’ and ‘icehacks’, to the grand literary figures of ‘Moliere’ and ‘Tolstoy’ (_Collected Poems_, pp. 81–8), and in doing so, as Catherine [Paul (2006](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r39): 424) concludes, ‘such seemingly small details become the poem’s subject’. What Paul means is that the ‘Index’ works to foreground previously insignificant details, recasting each poem in a new light. Under ‘L’, for instance, ‘La Fontaine, 305’ is indexed, directing the reader to the ‘Notes’ as opposed to the poems. Turning to the ‘Notes’, the reader discovers the following information: ‘“Everything to do with love is mystery”: F.C. Tilney; The Original Fables of La Fontaine: Dutton. Love and Folly: Book XII, No.14’ (_Complete Poems_, p. 305).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn23" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn23">23</a></sup> It’s a quotation found in ‘Marriage’, and under the influence of this reference, our understanding of the poem begins to shift. Once easily overlooked, the detail begins to define the poem itself: to what extent might we read ‘Marriage’ as an inheritor of this fabular French tradition, a kind of fable of marriage in and of itself? Once read, the edges of both ‘Index’ and poem begin to dictate and control the whole, recasting and re-forming the poem into a new configuration.

Moore’s ‘Index’ offers a blueprint of poetic dissection and reassembly, and to discuss the idea of parts and wholes in this manner is to anticipate the next stage of the discussion: the manner in which the ‘Index’ probes the various modes – and implications – of metonymical summary. It’s a curious idea, and one that is further informed by a glance at other instances of Moore’s interest in alphabetic classification: namely, dictionaries.

_M_

## multiple consciousness, 303

‘Moore’s interest in dictionaries’, as Stubbs writes, ‘\[is\] revealed both through her reviews of dictionaries in _The Dial_ and her use of them as textual sources for her poems’, and between 1925 and 1927, Moore reviewed three dictionaries as part of her ‘Briefer Mentions’ for _The Dial_ – John Walker’s _The Rhyming Dictionary of the English Language_, Peter Mark Roget’s _Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases_, and _The New Standard Bible Dictionary_, edited by Jacobus, Nourse, and Zerios ([Stubbs, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r47): 196–9). But if the table of contents and the index form what we might call paratextual bookends, then the index and the dictionary might instead be called paratextual counterpoints, each inverting the function of the other. A dictionary, as Moore writes in her review of Roget’s dictionary, is ‘a classification of words by ideas’ ([Moore, 1926](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r33): 431).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn24" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn24">24</a></sup> That is, a dictionary performs a kind of reverse mode of metonymy – expanding, as opposed to summarizing, the meaning of a word. And where the dictionary expands, Moore’s ‘Index’ contracts; the ‘Index’ presents not a classification of words by ideas, but instead a classification of ideas (or poems) by words, in what might be called a mode of indexical metonymy.

Put simply, metonymy is the linguistic process by which a word or concept is condensed, as with the reduction of ‘the royals’ to ‘the crown’, and it is precisely this kind of poetic compression that is present in the indexed entries to the poem ‘Sojourn in the Whale’. Published in 1917, the poem was written in the wake of the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin; Cristanne Miller unequivocally concludes that ‘the poem responds to the Easter Rebellion of 1916, and to the chaos of the following year, leading up to the establishment of the Irish Free State. Moore identifies herself with Ireland and against the colonizing Britain’ ([Miller, 2002](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r29): 3; see also [Stubbs, 2009](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r45)). Such an emphatically put argument is one materially reinforced by Moore’s mode of indexing. Where poems like ‘In the Days of Prismatic Colour’ produce multiple and myriad entries, ‘Sojourn in the Whale’ receives only four: ‘water … seeks its own level’, ‘WHALE, SOJOURN IN THE’, ‘SOJOURN IN THE WHALE’, and – crucially – ‘Ireland, 35’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn25" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn25">25</a></sup> Indexed in this way, ‘Ireland’ is rendered the crux of the poem – the defining detail, the key to interpretation. Such an interpretation is not erroneous per se – ‘Sojourn for the Whale’ unquestionably concerns Ireland.

Instead, the point is that in being indexed thus, the poem promotes a straightforward interpretation over a complex one – a portrait of a ‘mind in a straight-line’, if you will (‘People’s Surroundings’, _Collected Poems_, p. 56, l. 31). Along with the ‘Notes’, the ‘Index’ steers the eye, forming almost an alphabetized guide to reading.

Other instances of simple indexing in the ‘Index’ contribute to this sense of simplicity over subtlety, particularly in the case of the poem ‘To a Snail’. To turn to the ‘Index’ in search of mentions of ‘To a Snail’ is to find the following references: ‘knowledge of principles, 19, 296’ and the titular references ‘SNAIL, TO A, 19, 296’ and ‘TO A SNAIL, 19, 296’. Following the references back to the ‘Notes’, as the ‘Index’ instructs, uncovers the following:

### To a Snail

“compression is the first grace as style”: Democritus

“method of conclusions”; “knowledge of principles”: Duns Scotus

(_Complete Poems_, p. 296)

The references to Democritus, an ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosopher, and Duns Scotus, a philosopher-theologian of the High Middle Age, lend the apparently innocuous poem a decisively metaphysical twist. Abruptly the poem’s discussion of the merits of the precise, self-contained shape of a snail is here transformed into an extended metaphor for a consideration of poetic and prosaic style: a philosophical treatise on the importance of compression over sprawling extension. And in case you missed it, the efficient indexing, with its direction to the ‘Notes’, elects the relevant points for the eye to focus on: a steer to guide interpretation. ‘If “compression is the first grace of style”’, as Democritus would say, then the ‘Index’ has style indeed: it provides an immediate, condensed ‘“knowledge of \[the poem’s\] principles”’ (_Complete Poems_, p. 19, l.1, l.11).

Yet a steer can also be a blinker, and scrutinized in this manner, the impact – and potential pitfalls – of this divergence become abruptly apparent. Where metaphor is based upon substitution and similarity, Roman Jakobson theorizes in ‘The metaphoric and metonymic poles’ that metonymy is instead based upon predication, contexture and contiguity (2002: 41–8). That is, while metaphor substitutes one complete unit for another complete unit – whole for whole – metonymy, by contrast, reduces a complete unit to a set of associative synecdoches, the edges standing in for the whole. Considered in this light, the implications of such linguistic operations have wide-ranging and potentially corrosive consequences for the word in question, as Jakobson identifies. While the former – the metaphor – ‘involves a deterioration of metalinguistic operations’, he notes, ‘the latter \[metonymy\] damages the capacity for maintaining the hierarchy of linguistic units’ ([Jakobson, 2002](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r23): 42). That is, the process of taking part for whole dismantles the process by which importance is conveyed: the part begins to dwarf the whole.

‘You crush all particles down | into close conformity, and then walk back and forth on them’ (_Complete Poems_, p. 17). So declares Moore’s 1920 poem ‘To a Steam Roller’, and, be it intentional or otherwise, it’s not hard to see the way in which these words begin to apply to a consideration of Moore’s ‘Index’. For what effect does the act of crushing these poems ‘down into close conformity’ have on the poem itself? Might it, as ‘To a Steam Roller’ claims, crush ‘sparkling chips of rock … down to the level of the parent block’ – reduce and ultimately remove its subtleties? With this in mind, we turn now to consider the case of ‘Black Earth’. Written in 1918, the poem is critically considered to be ‘a brilliant exploration of the limitations and necessity of the body in relation to the soul as well as a lively intertextual response to \[Moore’s\] poetic contemporaries’, as Cristanne Miller writes: an elephant’s monologue that morphs into a consideration of ‘external poise’ and ‘spiritual poise’ (_Complete Poems_, p. 42, ll. 36, 39) ([Miller, 2004](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r30); see also [Tomlinson, 1957](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r49)). Closely considered, you can see what Miller means: Pound took the poem as evidence that Moore was, as he put it, ‘a jet-black Ethiopian, Othello-hued’, and throughout the poem, the image of ‘this elephant skin’ – ‘black and beautiful’ and, crucially, opaque – morphs into a metaphor for the manner in which people refuse to see beneath skin (colour).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn26" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn26">26</a></sup>

A glance at the metonymized entries in the ‘Index’, however, would give an entirely different impression. Instead, ‘Black Earth’ receives only four entries – ‘alligator’, ‘hippopotamus’, ‘EARTH, BLACK’ and ‘BLACK EARTH’ – so that one might read the ‘Index’ and quite reasonably leave with the sense that ‘Black Earth’ is little more than a nature poem, concerning simply an ‘alligator’ and a ‘hippopotamus’. What was a complex poem concerning the separation of internal reality and external appearance, and the associated myopia of mankind, is abruptly transformed in a straightforward portrait of a bathing elephant, a still life in print. ‘Fibered over like black glass’, all that is perceptible is the surface of the poem itself; indexed thus, the poem’s complexity gives way to a succinct summary, metonymized to a part that is almost unrelated to the whole. ‘Will depth be depth\[?\]’, the poem asks (_Complete Poems_, p. 41). The answer, it seems, is no.

Within the pages of Moore’s ‘Index’, the construction of meaning initially becomes a synergistic process, with the practice of assorting and selecting – or as Moore might put it ‘picking and choosing’ – troubling a fixed conception of authorial control. The trajectory, and eventual culmination, of this poetic project of indexing, however, sees Moore move away from this initial understanding of indexes. As opposed to promoting a process of assorting, the question of indexing for Moore became one of dictating: compressing, as opposed to expanding. For while Moore’s scrutiny of indexes allows her to tackle the question of authorship and its relation to readership, it also enables her to put part before whole: to abridge until the whole is mangled beyond recovery.

## PAST IS THE PRESENT, THE, 29, 297

In the years that followed the publication of _Observations_, Moore’s poetic project seemed to shift. ‘Moore had always been an epigram-maker’, Cass White writes, ‘but in the 1940s the epigrams began to drive the poems’ attention to sensuous detail and expressive form, rather than the other way around’ (‘Introduction’, _Collected Poems_, p. xxv). It’s a characteristically apt observation, and what proves particularly instructive here is the word ‘epigram’. An epigram is a ‘short poem ending in a witty or ingenious turn of thought, to which the rest of the composition is intended to lead up’,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#fn27" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn27">27</a></sup> and while many of Moore’s earlier poems generate epigrams, Moore’s later work is instead founded on them, forgoing the characteristic complexity and ambiguity of her earlier work in favour of a compressed didacticism. Not content merely to create new poems, Moore infamously revised and omitted earlier works in pursuit of this poetic project, with _Complete Poems_ (1967) containing just over half of the poems she actually published during her lifetime. It is, you might say, the ultimate form of metonymy: the whole reduced to a compressed summary. Little wonder that the multivalent ‘Index’ of _Observations_ found itself omitted: the Moore of the 1940s had no space for ‘bats’, ‘badgers’ and ‘baby rivers’. Yet while Moore’s experiments with indexes might have begun with _Observations_, they did not end there, a poetic preoccupation evident in the controversial fate of ‘Poetry’.

‘Omissions are not accidents’, Moore writes in the opening pages to her _Complete Poems_ (1967). Accidental or otherwise, the version of ‘Poetry’ included in the 1967 _Complete Poems_ is marked more by omission than inclusion: comprising 30 lines in its first published appearance in the final issue of Alfred Kreymborg’s _Others_ magazine, the poem was reduced to 29 lines in the first edition of _Observations_, 13 in the second edition (1925), and finally three in _Complete Poems_ (1967) ([Schulze, 2002](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r44): 206; [Moore, 1967](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r35): 36). Initially composed of epigrams, the final version of ‘Poetry’ is pared down until it ultimately becomes just one:

I, too, dislike it.

Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it, one discovers in

it, after all, a place for the genuine.

(_Collected Poems_, p. 364)

Gone is the network of carefully interlocking off-rhymes – the ‘raw material of poetry in | all its rawness’ – and in its place is succinct, curt summary. Moore, as Bonnie [Costello (1981](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r13): 26) writes, has ‘concentrated all thought into a unity, into epigram’, until ‘Poetry’ figures as a summary of itself.

Turn to the backmatter of the collection, however, and the reader discovers the version of ‘Poetry’ printed in the 1924 edition of _Observations_, under the laconic heading ‘Original Version’ ([Moore, 1967](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r35): 266). Part precedes whole, as opposed to whole preceding part; the epigram comes before the poem itself. ‘It was not her usual practice to include her variorum’, Costello notes, and so the inclusion takes on a distinctive importance, as if Moore were providing an epigrammatic indexed entry to the original poem ([Costello, 1981](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r13): 25). Yet where before the ‘Index’ closed the collection, now it seems that the epigrammatic entry for ‘Poetry’ instead opens the collection – summary takes precedence over whole. Moore’s entire corpus has become an index to itself.

Once marginal to the collection, the ‘Index’ to _Observations_ abruptly begins to subsume Moore’s poetry; and the fate of ‘Poetry’, caught simultaneously between part and whole, sketches some contexts for thinking about both the advantages and the limitations of this kind of indexical approach. In fact, ‘Poetry’ becomes metonymical of Moore’s attitude to poetry as a whole: we are instructed to disregard not merely the original poem, but equally all the poetry that came before this point. In following the abbreviated version of the poem with the expanded, original version, however, Moore disrupts her own instruction. Like the entry ‘PAST IS THE PRESENT, THE, 29, 297’, which directs the attention both forwards to the poem ‘The Past is Present’ and backwards to the ‘Notes’ simultaneously, [Moore’s 1967](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.15#core-r35) _Complete Poems_ becomes caught between two contradictory urges, attempting to both expand and contract.

It is faced with precisely this kind of oxymoron that Moore’s ‘Index’ grapples and ultimately gives way: one cannot compress and expand simultaneously. Throughout the medium of the ‘Index’, Moore experimented with multiple different roles, jumping between poet, reader, and self-editor with dizzying speed. Ultimately, however, the ‘Index’ was not a form with which she would experiment again, and it seems telling that after this brief stint as a writer of self-editorial poetry, the poet began working as editor for _The Dial_. Despite this abandoning of her indexical experiment, however, the moment offers an important insight into the subsequent trajectory of Moore’s corpus. The ‘Index’ to _Observations_ provides an early example of Moore’s attempts to dismantle the hierarchy of reading, a poetic project she continued right up to the _Complete Poems_. Yet this process of dismantling ultimately begins to dismantle the poems themselves, a metonymical urge that anticipates the paradoxes of the 1967 _Complete Poems_, where the reader is left with more parts than wholes. Here, the ‘complete’ is not incomplete so much as replete with fragments, versions, notes and excisions. Just like Jonah in ‘Sojourn in the Whale’, the poems have been swallowed whole (_Complete Poems_, p. 35). Caught between poetic expansion and editorial compression, and therefore neatly metonymic of the wider process that Moore came to employ throughout her poetic career, the ‘Index’ circles back on itself, until its ethos finally seems captured in the line ‘LUNATIC, see FOOL’ (_Complete Poems_, p. 85). Perhaps, even for Moore, this had been an experiment too far. Ultimately, this discrete, but significant, example of experimental backtracking tells us that even Moore could be dazzled by the consequences of her own editorial, poetic and self-reflective intervention.
