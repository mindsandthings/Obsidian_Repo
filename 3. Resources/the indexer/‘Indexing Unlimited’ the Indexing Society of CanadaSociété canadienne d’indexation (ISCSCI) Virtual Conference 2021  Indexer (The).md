## Abstract

‘Indexing unlimited’ was the theme for the online conference hosted by the Indexing Society of Canada/Société canadienne d’indexation (ISC/SCI) on 27–9 May 2021. We combine three reports on the conference from Canada and Germany to provide an overview not only of the conference presentations but also of the experience of planning for and attending a virtual conference in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

> _**Indexing Unlimited**_
> 
> **Expand your knowledge and network**
> 
> _**Deadlines slip, clients go silent, and technology hiccups – these are the day-to-day challenges of an indexer’s life. Now, add the world changing in a flash. Αι-e we up to it? Of course! No challenge is too big for us, as long as we have the knowledge and the network to tap into.**_

‘Indexing unlimited’ was the theme for the online conference hosted by the Indexing Society of Canada/Société canadienne d’indexation (ISC/SCI) on 27–9 May 2021. We have combined several reports on the conference here to give an overview. We include extracts from reports originally published in the _ISC/SCI Bulletin_ by [JoAnne Burek (2021)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.40#core-R1), [Maggie Billard Cosgrave (2021)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.40#core-R2) and Tere [Mullin (2021)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.40#core-R6), and [Jochen Fassbender’s (2021b)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.40#core-R4) report on the conference for the journal of the German Society of Information Science (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Informationswissenschaft).

## Conference planning and logistics

After the disappointment of cancelling the annual conference in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ISC/SCI pondered whether to hold a conference in 2021 and, if so, how to do it. Maggie Billard Cosgrave, the programming chair, explains:

> The 2020 ISC/SCI conference, which was meant to be in Newfoundland, was cancelled – like everything else in 2020. So in the fall of that doomed year, when it came time to plan the conference for 2021, the committee thought: Should we risk it and plan for Newfoundland again? Or should we try – for the first time – to plan a virtual conference?
> 
> Nobody was in favour of planning to travel in spring 2021, especially at a time when covid cases were going up. So we opted for a virtual conference, choosing ‘Indexing Unlimited’ as the theme. We didn’t want to be limited by travel restrictions, so, with little experience but plenty of pluck, we forged ahead into the Valley of Zoom.

This proved to be a good decision, and it quickly became evident that it was possible, as JoAnne Burek explained:

> It didn’t take long to realize we could do it. Looking around, we saw how common it was for people to attend online meetings on laptops, tablets, and phones. We noticed how comfortable everyone was with talking into cameras … and how good we were getting at sharing screens. Why would we not have an online conference?
> 
> It was also clear that going virtual was a huge opportunity. It would open up our conference to many more people – especially those who don’t (or can’t) travel. Now can you see where we got the idea for our theme, ‘Indexing Unlimited’?
> 
> It got even better. We found that it was easier than ever to schedule speakers for the conference, because the time and cost of travel was no longer an issue. That’s how we were able to engage indexer speakers Pierke Bosschieter in the Netherlands; Max McMaster, Mary Coe, and Rebecca Muir in Australia; and Kate Mertes, Judi Gibbs, Pilar Wyman, and Christine Jacobs in Canada and the United States. In addition we have Jenny Higgins, former Wikipedian-in-Residence in Newfoundland, and keynote speaker Raegan Swanson from The ArQuives, Canada’s LGBTQ2+ Archives, in Toronto.

On the first day of the conference, everything was running smoothly, as Maggie describes:

> Fast-forward to 27 May 2021 – go time. Nobody knew what would happen, but we were like a couple on their wedding day: ‘The preparation is over, and whatever happens, happens.’ By halfway through that Thursday, it was evident the conference was a success. People were engaging in the networking sessions, in the speakers’ presentations, and (perhaps especially) in the chat.

From the outset, the positive atmosphere was reflected in the Zoom chat, with one participant expressing what many probably felt: ‘I’m much more excited than I thought I would be. It’s quite moving to see all these people I haven’t seen for sooooooo long. Hello everyone!!’ And throughout the conference the chat function enabled a much higher level of comment and discussion than is usually possible at an in-person conference.

Tere Mullin also considered the conference a success and rightfully gave credit to the ISC/SCI conference team:

> Organizers worked diligently to create an engaging, well-organized conference experience. We’ve learned over the past year that interacting virtually is not without its challenges. However, there were advantages to holding the conference online: presenters and attendees from all over the world were able to attend by dialling in, making the conference more accessible to some. It also allowed those with busy schedules to attend just part of the conference, and recorded sessions made available on the ISC/SCI website will allow people to listen to sessions they missed or particularly enjoyed. This was a new experience for many of us with respect to conferences, but I think it’s safe to say it was a great success.

Jochen Fassbender was also impressed. He noted the varied international audience, who joined the conference from North America, Europe, Egypt, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and China. Scheduling presentations for this audience were not an easy feat, as Jochen has described:

> Unter Berücksichtigung der fünf Zeitzonen Kanadas wurden die Konferenzzeiten zudem so geschickt gelegt, dass die Konferenztage für Europäer jeweils spätnachmittags begannen, und die australischen Präsentatoren zum Schluss hin (d. h. am australischen Morgen) an der Reihe waren. Der ISC ist mit diesem zeitlichen Spagat eine wahre interkontinentale Konferenz gelungen, die auch geographisch dem Motto ‘Indexing Unlimited’ folgte.
> 
> Taking into account Canada’s five time zones, the conference timings were so skilfully handled that the conference days for Europeans always began late in the afternoon, and the Australian presenters had their turn at the end of the day (when it was morning in Australia). With the timing of this balancing act, the ISC achieved a true intercontinental conference, geographically in keeping with the conference theme of ‘Indexing Unlimited’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.40#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup>

## Networking and social opportunities

The conference organizers knew that networking and socializing were important parts of conferences, as JoAnne Burek explained:

> If you’ve ever attended one of our conferences, you know that part of the attraction is getting to know your colleagues. You might remember lunching at a different table every day so you could meet new people and swap stories about work life, clients, and the business. Perhaps you stood at the jigsaw puzzle table, bonding with fellow indexers as you worked to put the pieces together. Well, the conference committee is determined to bring socializing and fun to the virtual conference too.

Tere Mullin also emphasized the networking and social events:

> Many of us enjoy ISC/SCI conferences not just for educational purposes but also to chat. It’s nice to be able to talk shop with other people who appreciate indexing, and to discuss indexing challenges while making new connections. The organizers of ‘Indexing Unlimited’ made sure to build this into the conference programming by including a variety of opportunities to socialize virtually. These included two themed discussions, a quiz, two networking periods, 15-minute introductory chats at the beginning of each day, and informal chat time at the end of each day.

The themed discussion sessions in break-out rooms were almost more effective than at an in-person conference, with the bilingual indexers’ group (which quickly morphed into a multilingual indexers’ group) becoming the basis for international collaboration on an ongoing project to build a multilingual dictionary of indexing terms (see [Fassbender, 2021a](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.40#core-R3)).

Tere also noted the sessions for new indexers, which were appreciated:

> This year’s conference included two sessions especially for new indexers. The first Fireside Chat session was held at the end of day one and was led by Margaret de Boer; the second was hosted by Stephen Ullstrom at the end of day two. Attendees were encouraged to submit questions, and topics included marketing, time management, client relationships, educational resources and opportunities, and dealing with emotionally difficult subject matter. Lora Marchand, who attended both Fireside Chats, commented that the hosts were very welcoming and she was grateful for the opportunity to brainstorm with other new indexers.

## Conference sessions: day one

The conference began with a welcome from Alexandra Peace (ISC/SCI president) and Lisa Fedorak (conference chair), followed by ‘meet your colleagues’, a 15-minute ice-breaker session in which conference participants were randomly placed in break-out rooms to introduce themselves to one another. The main programme included nine presentations and two discussion panels on a variety of topics. Tere Mullin provided a summary of the presentations in her report, which are extracted below.

### Session 1: Autobiography of an indexing relationship (Kate Mertes)

> Kate described an ongoing project with the Church Historian’s Press that began in 2014, when she was hired to index a collection of documents relating to the founder of the Latter-day Saints (LDS) movement, Joseph Smith. Indexing these materials, which consist of journals, administrative records, letters, and various other documents, presents certain challenges. The project requires detailed indexing, establishing a controlled vocabulary, and adhering to the LDS Church’s guidelines. Additionally, the documents do not form a narrative, which Kate has addressed by tackling each volume’s material by document type, rather than from beginning to end, as we might typically index a book.
> 
> Kate is now several years and several volumes into the project. Along the way, she says she’s learned a lot, not only about Joseph Smith and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but also about developing and maintaining a healthy and productive client relationship. Significant to this relationship has been her client’s responsiveness to suggestions as the project moves along; Kate credits her client’s flexibility and openness to breaking the odd rule when necessary. She continues to find the project stimulating and will begin the tenth volume of the series this fall.

### Session 2: Indexing standards. See NISO (Judi Gibbs and Pilar Wyman)

> Our second presentation of the first day was by Judi Gibbs and Pilar Wyman, on the creation of a new, up-to-date standard for the US National Information Standards Organization (NISO). Along with Janet Perlman, Pilar and Judi formed a group and began developing the NISO Z39.4 standard in 2019, when it became apparent that current standards were several years out of date. NISO Z39.4 will surpass current indexing guidelines by providing comprehensive international standards that address various kinds of indexing, including non-displayed and database indexing. In creating the new standard, the group has emphasized usability, with the intention of providing clear and accessible information to a variety of stakeholders within a variety of contexts. The group anticipates publication of the new standard by mid-July.

Conference participants felt that it had been a monumental achievement to get to this stage, with one commenting that it is ‘probably the finest indexing standard’. One of the other members of the group, Janet Perlman, noted that ‘it was an extremely positive experience to work on this project. It was a wonderful example of a group centered on professionalism, respect, and a high-quality product’. Conference participants were also particularly pleased to learn that it covered ebooks. There was also a related discussion in the chat about Google searches and whether they should prioritize indexes.

For the next hour, participants had the choice of several break-out rooms to discuss a variety of different indexing specialisms, and this merged into a longer break for what was an early lunch in western Canada and an evening meal in the UK and Europe. Duly refreshed, they returned to learn about the latest Ewart-Daveluy Award and a presentation from Australia, where it was only 6 a.m.

### Ewart-Daveluy Award announcement

> This year’s winner of the Ewart-Daveluy Award for excellence in indexing is Stephen Ullstrom, for his index to _The Shield of Psalmic Prayer: Reflections on Translating, Interpreting, and Praying the Psalter_, by the late Donald Sheehan. Stephen is an active member of ISC/SCI, having served on the executive committee for six years. He has won two previous awards, the 2014 Purple Pen Award for best new indexer, and the Society’s 2019 Tamarack Award. Congratulations, Stephen!

Conference participants were generous with their congratulations and intrigued to learn about Stephen’s links with the author through mutual friends. For more on this, see the report on the award in the September 2021 issue of _The Indexer_.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.40#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup>

### Session 3: Quoting on projects (Max McMaster)

> Max McMaster spoke about quoting on indexing jobs, something relevant for indexers at any level. Prior to the conference, Max distributed a survey to attendees to compile information about how indexers make decisions around quoting. The survey presented participants with a number of scenarios, addressing factors such as the amount of information provided about the text, turnaround time, number of pages, budget, and whether the client was a for-profit or non-profit organization. Based on the results, turnaround time appears to be a significant factor for indexers when quoting on jobs. The amount quoted also rose slightly when indexers were provided with a blurb describing the text, rather than quoting blind.
> 
> Max highlighted several important considerations for quoting on projects, such as one’s familiarity with the subject and with one’s indexing software; familiarity with the publisher’s style; the presence of tables, illustrations and notes; and commitments outside of work. Also worth noting is that, when faced with a short turnaround time, it may be tempting to offer a less detailed index; however, this often requires more decision-making time than writing a comprehensive index.

Indexers may love indexing, but expect to receive fair recompense for their work, and as with any session about fees and quoting, this generated many comments in the chat, especially about ‘rush fees’ for urgent last-minute jobs, methods of tracking fees for different kinds of jobs, and charging for editing after the client has reviewed the index. One newer indexer was amazed to learn that in the pre-Internet ‘dark ages’ one usually quoted for jobs without having seen a sample of the text.

This was the last formal presentation of the day, but next on the programme was an hour-long ‘speed-networking’ session (modelled on those included in the online conference of the UK Chartered Institute of Editors and Proofreaders), with participants randomly placed in break-out rooms with around six other people every fifteen minutes. Part way through this, newer indexers who had registered for the first ‘fireside chat’ left to join this.

## Conference sessions: day two

As on day one, participants were welcomed by Alexandra Peace and Lisa Fedorak, and 15 minutes of ‘meet your colleagues’ in random break-out rooms. The first formal presentation of the day was the keynote speech.

### Session 4 (Keynote): Queering archival spaces and description: LGBTQ2+ community history and language at the ArQuives (Raegan Swanson)

> This year’s keynote speaker was Raegan Swanson, who spoke about the largest independent LGBTQ2+ archives in the world, the ArQuives. Located in Toronto, the ArQuives houses, preserves, and provides public access to information related to or created by the LGBTQ2+ community. Raegan provided us with a history of the ArQuives and discussed current challenges and initiatives. As she explained, since its establishment in 1973, the ArQuives has been run primarily by volunteers and thus has no formal classification system; a classification system specific to LGBTQ2+ issues would greatly enhance the collection’s accessibility.
> 
> In addressing the role of privilege in collecting practices, the implementation of an accurate collections description policy has also become a greater priority for the ArQuives. As Raegan says, archival collections have traditionally been run by white males, precluding representation of some members of the LGBTQ2+ community. With this in mind, a new ArQuives collections description policy is currently being developed. It will go through a community consultation phase before it is implemented.

Needless to say, conference participants found the problems of terminology for this material fascinating, noting similar problems they had encountered in their own work, such as dealing with changes of name and the need for cross-references.

### Session 5: The polished inde**x:** upping your indexing game (Christine Jacobs)

> Day two continued with Christine Jacobs’s session on editing and refining to turn an adequate index into one that really stands out. As Christine notes, a well-crafted index begins early in the process, with a clear understanding of what’s required, and thus clear communication with the client. It’s also worth taking the time to consider the structure of the index early on. For instance, would the text be better served by having two indexes rather than one? As we work through a project, imagining the readers’ perspective and how they might search for information will guide us in selecting appropriate terms. We can get the most out of cross-references, double posting and subheadings by using them thoughtfully. We should aim for a solid structure, predictability for the reader, balance, and cohesion. Questions to consider include: Have we covered all the book’s themes adequately? Is there symmetry between terms? Could we be more succinct? The final stage, proofreading, should be done systematically and attentively. Finally, if there’s time to let the index ‘marinate,’ take advantage of that and come back to it with fresh eyes. Christine ended her presentation with a suggested reading list.

Many participants agreed with the importance of letting the index mature (one likened this process to a good cheese maturing) before final editing, and there were also a surprising number of comments about the difference between _see_ and _see also_ cross-references. Several participants expressed astonishment that even some indexers are apparently confused about the difference.

After two back-to-back presentations, another ‘speed-networking’ session made a welcome change and a break for whatever meal was appropriate prepared participants for the final sessions of the day.

### Session 6: Something Wikid this way comes **…** to the Centre for Newfoundland Studies (Jenny Higgins)

> Jenny Higgins was our third speaker of the day, describing her experience as the first Wikipedian in Residence at the Centre for Newfoundland Studies (2019). Jenny began by providing background on Wikipedia and its relationship with galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAMs). Most of us are quite familiar with Wikipedia, but the site contains a number of useful research tools we might not be taking advantage of. For instance, did you know that clicking on an ISBN in the bibliographic references at the bottom of the page will take you directly to the WorldCat library catalogue? Wikipedia and GLAMs share a common goal, which is to provide free access to reliable information. While libraries, museums, archives, and galleries have the information, Wikipedia has a global reach, making the two natural partners in providing access to knowledge.
> 
> Jenny is passionate about her work, and she shares this with others by encouraging budding Wikipedians to contribute and interact with the site. She has held successful workshops called ‘edit-a-thons’ where she teaches others how to edit and verify citations and create content for Wikipedia. Jenny notes that, while Wikipedia is a fantastic tool, content gaps remain. There is much opportunity to add content relating to underrepresented communities.

Participants were particularly interested to learn about Wikipedia citations and enthused by the idea of ‘edit-a-thons’. Several had already had a go at editing Wikipedia pages or had taken part in an ‘edit-a-thon’ and were keen on the idea of having one for indexing, which they felt needed a more substantial presence on Wikipedia.

Prior to the final presentation of the day, participants were randomly allocated to break-out rooms for a short quiz. As the conference programme explained, this was ‘to shake up the monotony of the screen’ while they racked their brains ‘to answer the obscure – and not so obscure – trivia submitted by conference attendees’.

### Session 7: ‘In my mind’s eye, I’m turning the page’: how do readers make sense of active e-book indexes? (Mary Coe)

> Next, Mary Coe spoke about her research into how readers make sense of active e-book indexes. Mary’s approach places the focus on the reader rather than on the e-book system, and it seeks to understand what factors influence the way people use active e-book indexes. Mary’s methodology involved creating prototype e-book indexes with varied levels of locator specificity and inviting participants to complete a task using the index in a laboratory environment. Participants’ behaviours were recorded using eye-tracking equipment and specialized software, and they were invited to comment on their decision-making process once the experiment was complete.
> 
> Mary’s research suggests, among other things, that e-book users are influenced by their experience with print books, since the concept of a page is still relevant to them. Readers tended to skim the page they were led to from the index even if they were directed to a specific paragraph, perhaps indicating that they had confidence in the index but not that it would take them to the specific location they desired. It also appears that users are influenced by their use of internet search engines and expect some of the same search functions to be present in active e-books. Suggestions for improvements to active e-book indexes include making scanning easier by adding dropdown options for headings and subheadings within the text, the inclusion of hyperlinks, and the addition of an index icon in the toolbar. Mary concluded her presentation with recommendations for future research and suggestions for further reading.

As this session merged into the end-of-day informal chat and participants gradually drifted off (or moved over to the second ‘fireside chat’), this presentation led to an interesting discussion as to what term should be used for what in printed books we would refer to as a ‘locator’ or more simply a page number. Suggestions included ‘locator link’, ‘e-locator’, ‘e-ref’, ‘end point’, ‘pointer’, ‘landing place’ and ‘target’.

## Conference sessions: day three

The third day began with the usual welcome from Alexandra Peace and Lisa Fedorak and a short presentation from Caroline Diepeveen about the 2022 international conference in Berlin. Enthusiasm for the prospect of an in-person (or at least hybrid) conference changed to sadness as we learnt of the death of Drusilla Calvert three days earlier. Drusilla was well known throughout the indexing world, not just to MACREX users, but the latter had benefited from her help, advice and friendship over several decades.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.40#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup>

### Session 8: Pre-emptive preliminaries: or how to build a satisfying client relationship (Pierke Bosschieter)

> Pierke Bosschieter got us started on day three of the conference with a discussion on building and maintaining satisfying client relationships. After a negative experience with a client early in her career, Pierke implemented practices to pre-empt such problems. She outlined email communication principles that can set us up for success, such as clarity, promptness, thoroughness, ending the conversation conclusively, and using the appropriate level of formality. In order to give clients clear expectations of the indexing process and answers to common questions, Pierke provides her clients with a document she refers to as her ‘terms and conditions’ file, which she generously shared with conference participants. It includes information on fees, the kinds of files the client must provide, and a guide for reviewing the finished index. Finally, if conflict does arise or we need to respond to feedback, Pierke emphasizes professionalism: apologize sincerely for errors, explain your rationale or decision-making process if it’s unclear to the client, and curtail any verbal abuse by engaging only to the extent that it’s necessary.

This presentation generated a considerable number of comments in the ‘chat’, especially on working directly with authors rather than publishers, and on the need for more ‘hand holding’ with ‘needy’ or inexperienced authors. However, one participant, concerned that new indexers might be forming the impression that problematical clients were frequently encountered, reassured them that in her experience they were very few and far between, a sentiment echoed by several others. Discussion also focused on the issue of clients reviewing finished indexes, with participants exchanging information on how they charged for additional editing, a topic that had already been aired in the earlier presentation on quoting.

Another ‘themed discussion’ session followed, and it was during this that the seed was sown for the embryonic multilingual-dictionary project. This amply demonstrated the value of indexers from around the world getting together in the online environment; many would have been unable to attend an in-person conference.

After another break for refreshments (morning coffee for those on Pacific time and an evening meal for Europeans and South Africans), it was time to hear from six past winners of the Ewart-Daveluy Award and the very different indexes they had written.

### Session 9: The road to the Ewart-Daveluy Award (panel)

> This was an 80-minute session, which allowed each panel participant to discuss the text they indexed and the challenges it presented, as well as a bit about their background and their experience having won the award.
> 
> **Anna Olivier** was co-winner in 2020 for her index to _Les générations des Soufis: Ṭabaqāt al-ṣūfiyya de Abū ʿAbd alRaḥmān, Muḥammad b. Ḥusayn al-Sulamī_. Anna drew upon her background in geography, languages and literature in taking on this challenging project. As an indexer working in both English and French, Anna was partly motivated to apply for the award to draw attention to French indexing.
> 
> **Carla DeSantis**, also winner of the 2020 award, was motivated to apply so that she might receive valuable feedback from the judges. Carla describes herself as a relatively new indexer, and her winning index to _Cultures of the Fragment: Uses of the Iberian Manuscript, 1100–1600_ was only her second. She outlined some of the challenges specific to the project, such as how to indicate manuscript shelf marks and library collection names in the index. An added challenge was that she completed this index in Microsoft Word!
> 
> The winner in 2018, **Audrey McClellan**, had been indexing for several years when she applied for the award, but not on a regular basis. She was initially reluctant to apply but says that writing the short essay portion of the application made her realize she had indeed taken on a complex project. Audrey’s winning index was for _Churchill and Fisher: The Titans at the Admiralty Who Fought the First World War_, which included an index of ships as well as a subject index. Like several of the other panellists, Audrey encourages indexers to apply for awards such as the Ewart-Daveluy, despite doubts they may have about winning.
> 
> **Judy Dunlop** was awarded in 2017, for her index to _One Child Reading: My Auto-bibliography_. Judy describes the text as a collection of materials the author considered significant to her development as a reader. Along with these materials, reading theory and a biographical element formed the text’s metatopics. Judy explained how she brought these three main concepts together in the index with her thoughtful use of subheadings.
> 
> **Mary Newberry** was the winner in 2016. She described the sense of engagement she gets from indexing and how much she enjoys sharing her passion – so much so that she submitted two indexes to the jury! Mary’s winning index was for _The Letterbooks of John Evelyn_, in two volumes; it was written by a lover of lists, which posed a particular indexing problem. Similarly, the text contained an unusually high number of passing mentions. In her discussion, Mary shared how she cleverly addressed these issues.
> 
> **François Trahan** won the Ewart-Daveluy Award in 2015 for his index to _Ancient Pathways, Ancestral Knowledge: Ethnobotany and Ecological Wisdom of Indigenous Peoples of Northwestern North America._ François’s index was 49 pages long, consisting of a 40-page general index and a 9-page plant species index. The project required paying special attention to plant names, and in particular dealing with instances of multiple names for the same plant and multiple plants with the same name. François has a personal interest in the subject matter, having studied local plants as a hobby, which helped him along the way.

For the final session of the conference, it was back to the other side of the world, where the two presenters in early-morning Australia had not yet had their breakfast!

### Session 10: The spark is curiosity: becoming practitioner–researchers (Rebecca Muir and Mary Coe)

> Rebecca Muir and Mary Coe then spoke about becoming practitioner–researchers. Mary and Rebecca define a practitioner–researcher as someone who has both research skills and professional experience. As such, they’re able to close the gap between academia and practice, translating and implementing knowledge in real-world contexts. Mary’s role as editor of _The Indexer_ exemplifies this: she creates a bridge between indexers and the broader community, including academia. Mary also noted that the combined knowledge and experience that practitioner–researchers possess are invaluable to employers.
> 
> Having been an indexer for 30 years, Mary came to research through her curiosity about how readers use indexes. This led her to pursue a PhD program with an applied research stream. Rebecca decided to enroll in a doctorate program after having worked in government for several years. She described an interaction with a client who said libraries ‘weren’t for her,’ which led Rebecca to wonder why someone would come to that conclusion. For both Rebecca and Mary, that initial curiosity was critical in leading them to where they are now, and they emphasized this as a starting point for those seeking to further their goals as practitioner–researchers.

If this presentation has encouraged more indexers to get involved in research, the pages of _The Indexer_ will be the perfect place to disseminate the results. Indexes are compiled for users, but user research has been notoriously limited, and often conducted in rather artificial environments. The more we understand about our users, the more we can both educate them and tailor our indexes to meet their needs and expectations, using indexing ‘rules’ in a pragmatic fashion according to the demands of each particular project and its audience.

## Virtual conference experience

All three reporters hailed the conference a success and enjoyed the virtual format. Maggie Billard Cosgrave described the experience:

> The talks were varied, practical, informative, and everything in between. (If you registered for the conference, you can access recordings for a year afterwards.) Although there’s a distance in Zoom between everyone at home, there’s also something intimate about it, as if you’re engaging with the speaker directly because they’re up close on the screen. It’s almost more interactive than in person, especially with the chat messages constantly bringing up questions and conversation simultaneously. You can also get up if you want, turn off the camera, and be alone for a bit. This is an advantage if you’re an introvert like me, as many of us indexers are.
> 
> But though we may be introverts, we still love to talk about indexing (or anything, really). For fifteen minutes every morning we started the day right by chatting with colleagues. Over the three days there were also two speed-networking sessions in small groups, a very fun quiz, and two sessions of themed discussions. Participants were randomly assigned to these groups so that (for the most part) everyone saw as many people as possible. Zoom may not always be that good at randomly assigning, but it wasn’t the end of the world. There were always the end-of-day freeform chats, where you could choose which group you wanted to join. Some of those, I hear, went on late into the night …
> 
> It was absolutely stunning how smoothly everything went. This was not just because of Lisa Fedorak and the Conference Committee’s hard work, but also thanks to Lee Stickles’s fantastic technical management. There were hardly any glitches, and anything that did go wrong was dealt with so quickly and efficiently that it hardly made an impact – and it was met with good humour anyway.
> 
> Of course, good humour and friendliness are hallmarks of indexers, which was another reason for the conference’s success. We had attendees from around the globe, some of whom were up in the wee hours of the morning, happily participating. And the ‘fireside chats’ set up for new indexers were lively as new faces joined a welcoming community of people more than willing to help with anything.

While Tere Mullin also thought the virtual format a success, she optimistically ended her report by thinking ahead to the next year when a face-to-face conference might be possible again:

> Although it will be exciting to attend the conference in person next year (and to have an excuse to visit St. John’s, Newfoundland!), I thoroughly enjoyed this year’s virtual conference, and I know my colleagues really benefited from it as well. Thank you, ISC/SCI conference organizers for your dedication and hard work. See you all next year, one way or another!

Whatever the future holds, one thing is for certain: indexers hold great conferences in any format! Maggie Billard Cosgrave sums it up best:

> A virtual conference came of necessity but ended up being a grand success. Will we maintain a virtual element in future conferences? Who knows. Nothing can replace the joy of getting together in person, chatting over sandwiches, going to a bar with a group, hugging old friends and new. Imagine next year – the joy of hugging! And sightseeing! But there’s also a joy in being able to include people who, for whatever reason, can’t join in person. The future is uncertain, but we can rely on this: indexers are wonderful, ingenious people, and we will make it work.
