Volume 40, Number 1

## Abstract

As the only international journal devoted to indexing, _The Indexer_ should have been indexed in exemplary fashion, enabling both indexers and researchers to easily access the wealth of information accumulated over more than 60 years. As this journey through the chequered history of indexing the journal reveals, more often than not standardization and consistency have been thrown to the winds, leaving users struggling to find their way through the dead wood to the information they seek. Attempts to prepare an acceptable cumulative index have so far failed, but by learning from past mistakes, perhaps we can move forward along a different path and create an index to the journal of which the profession can justly be proud.

The complete back run of _The Indexer_ from 1958 to the present has been available in digital form for some years, and there is no doubt that this archive contains a wealth of information of relevance to both practising indexers and researchers.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> But how easy is it to find one’s way through this dense forest of words? For recent issues, and like many journals, _The Indexer_ now includes a basic author/title index in the final (December) issue of each year, divided into sections (regular features, articles, conference reports and book reviews). Essentially, this is no more than a two-page contents list for the whole year – useful as far as it goes. But what about earlier issues? The coverage is patchy. Although author and title indexes on _The Indexer_ website (see [Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#F1)) cover the whole run of the journal, as does the regularly updated classified list of articles by topic categories, the online cumulative index covers only nine volumes (1996–2010).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> As for earlier printed volume indexes, these have not been entirely satisfactory.

Back in 1958, the first issue of _The Indexer_ reproduced a leading article from _The Times_, which averred that ‘the part of the Society’s publications which will be most eagerly scrutinized will be its own index’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup> We must ask: have the indexes to _The Indexer_ stood up to this scrutiny? And as we enter the third decade of the twenty-first century, how we can best ensure continued access to (and use of) _The Indexer_’s digital archive?

Prompted by informal conversations with the editor of _The Indexer_ and several members of the Australian and New Zealand Society of Indexers (ANZSI), the first of this series of articles focuses mainly on the ‘chequered and blood-bespattered’ history of indexing _The Indexer_:<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup> who was doing it, how the indexes were perceived, what guidelines and conventions were observed (if any), and the vexed question of preparing a cumulative index. Subsequent articles will look at the available guidance and recommendations on journal indexing (including many articles in _The Indexer_ itself), identifying some of the practices employed, and consider how readers access the content of back issues more generally.

The ultimate aim of the series is to consider the way forward for _The Indexer_ – the only international journal devoted to the subject of indexing. Surely it should have an exemplary index to its contents. What can we learn from past experience (and past mistakes) and is a complete cumulative index a realistic aspiration rather than just a pipe-dream? If it _is_ feasible, what are the options for achieving this?

## No clear path

From the beginning (and up to 2005), volume indexes were produced regularly, commissioning them being the responsibility of the journal editor, and they were generally included within the final issue of each volume.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup> According to Hazel Bell (editor 1978–95), ‘it was over the indexing of volumes of _The Indexer_ that I came thoroughly to understand and even empathise with publishers’ impatience with indexers’ ([Bell, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R2): 49). Unlike the basic author/title indexes that have been included since 2019, these were much more detailed – proper indexes, one might say – with authors, titles and subjects in one single sequence. Their compilation was initially a largely voluntary activity, often undertaken, according to [John Ainsworth Gordon (1983)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R10), by ‘indexers of distinction and long experience’. Indeed, four of them received the prestigious Wheatley Medal (but not for their indexes to _The Indexer_).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn6" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn6">6</a></sup> But according to Hazel Bell it was not always easy to find a willing volunteer,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn7" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn7">7</a></sup> and Gordon sensed that they had often been prepared hurriedly to meet deadlines, by indexers appointed at the last minute rather than commissioned in advance to work through the first three issues of the volume without the pressure of an impending deadline.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn8" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn8">8</a></sup>

Far from being regarded as an honour to compile the volume index, it can be seen more as a poisoned chalice; indeed, one indexer questioned her ‘audacity (or professional suicide) in attempting it’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn9" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn9">9</a></sup> The difficulty of finding volunteers is not surprising; the index was frequently criticized, often in no uncertain terms. Heated exchanges documented in the SI archives reveal indexers furious at changes made to their work and editorial board members threatening to resign, fuelling existing deep-seated animosities. This is not the place to rake over the details of these arguments; there is no doubt that those involved cared passionately about indexing, but their divergent views indicate the fundamental problem that has dogged the whole debate – the absence of agreed guidelines. This is considered further below.

For at least the first 12 volumes, these volunteer indexers apparently received no payment or only a modest honorarium, in common with others involved in running the Society. But in 1981 the SI Council eventually agreed that members should not be exploited in this way; indexing _The Indexer_ should be put on a professional footing.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn10" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn10">10</a></sup> However, [Hazel Bell (2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R2): 50) reports that the indexer for Volume 12 ‘said the hours were excessive and innumerable, and would accept only a small token payment’. Indeed, financial concerns meant that recommended hourly rates were rarely paid, and for the remainder of the decade a ceiling of around £250 was set.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn11" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn11">11</a></sup> At the then recommended hourly rates, this variously represented payment for between 37 and 53 hours’ work,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn12" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn12">12</a></sup> which seems generous for a journal of only modest size. Indeed, several editorial board members regarded a ceiling of £200 enough for ‘such a straightforward index’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn13" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn13">13</a></sup>

## Unable to see the wood for the trees: a case of over-indexing?

Papers in the SI archives indicate that these volume indexes do seem to have taken an inordinate time to complete: one indexer took 70 hours (for a 288-page volume), representing an indexing rate of only four pages of text per hour, while another spent 50 hours indexing a 318-page volume (6.4 pages per hour).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn14" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn14">14</a></sup>

Inspection of these indexes throws some light on this puzzle:<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn15" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn15">15</a></sup> the overall impression is of excessive length, out of all proportion to the size of the journal and suggesting a tendency to over-index. The first few volumes (which ranged in length from 116 to 208 pages) generally included not unreasonable three-page indexes. (But in double columns of 8-point type, with no typographical variation apart from italics for book titles, these are not easy on the eye.) In subsequent volumes (which varied from around 200 to just over 300 pages in length) it was not uncommon for indexes to extend to as many as 11 or 12 pages of double columns, again in 8-point and with little typographic variation.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn16" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn16">16</a></sup> For the final few volumes to be indexed, and following the change in format to A4, more reasonable three-page indexes (in three columns) prevailed.

The apparently excessive length of some of these indexes can be partially justified by several factors relating to the content of the journal. First, book reviews gradually occupied an increasing number of pages,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn17" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn17">17</a></sup> and were usually indexed under several headings (often under author, title and subject, and under a general ‘Book reviews’ heading). ‘Letters to the editor’ were also a regular feature for many years, and again each one generally received several index entries.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn18" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn18">18</a></sup>

Second, the changing role of _The Indexer_ may have initially justified detailed indexing of, for example, material relating specifically to the Society of Indexers, since it was in effect both a newsletter for SI members and a journal for indexers and institutions more widely.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn19" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn19">19</a></sup> As Hazel Bell explained, ‘The _Indexer_ began publication in 1958 as the publication of the newly-formed Society of Indexers, and a vehicle of communication among its members’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn20" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn20">20</a></sup> But as the journal became more international in outlook and scope (as reflected in its subtitle), a focus on SI activities was increasingly inappropriate.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn21" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn21">21</a></sup> And as Hazel Bell argued, it was more appropriate for the more parochial activities of the various indexing societies to be mainly reported (and, by extension, indexed) in their own newsletters.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn22" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn22">22</a></sup>

A third factor contributing to these rather bloated indexes was the practice of including shorter items (often a single column or less), which did not always merit inclusion in the Contents list but were nevertheless often considered worth indexing. Similarly, ‘snippets’ or ‘fillers’ occupying the blank spaces between articles were a regular feature for many years and were often thought to merit index entries.

On the whole, however, many of the indexes give the impression that the text has been analysed in minute detail, much like a book, with this unnecessarily detailed indexing setting a precedent and colouring discussions on the feasibility of producing a cumulative index. As a general rule, journal indexing is not the same as back-of-the-book indexing. Although varying from one journal to the next, at least partly depending on the needs of the core readership, detailed page-by-page indexing is neither necessary nor useful.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn23" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn23">23</a></sup> Essentially, journal indexing is often at the article level,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn24" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn24">24</a></sup> and it is not helpful to most users, particularly those consulting a cumulative index, to learn that a topic is discussed on one particular page within an article, rather than being a central theme of the whole article. Neither is it helpful if the index suggests that several different aspects of a topic are covered in the journal, only to discover that these references are actually all to the same article.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn25" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn25">25</a></sup> Since most users today access journal articles online, a reference to the complete article span will be most useful.

Although John Thornton, the first editor of _The Indexer_, did indeed make the very valid point that a journal index is _not_ used like that of a book (see below under ‘Let’s get our bearings: guidelines and thesaurus’), this does not seem to have been taken on board. None of the guidelines discussed below really covered the depth of indexing required, which seems to have been left to the discretion of the individual indexer. Indeed, even the earliest indexes (apparently by Thornton himself) show evidence of some over-indexing, including topics mentioned _within_ articles, sometimes hardly more than passing mentions. For example (from the index to Volume 1):

> Abbreviations, filing of, 45, 100, 108
> 
> Alphabetization, 45–46, 66–67, 96–103
> 
> Elisions, filing of, 45
> 
> Filing, 45–46
> 
> Letter-by-letter method of alphabetization, 45, 66–67, 98–99
> 
> Word-by-word alphabetization, 45, 66–67, 98–99

There is insufficient space here to analyse these entries in detail, but interested readers may easily access the relevant articles on _The Indexer_ website and form their own conclusions on the relevance of some of these entries (especially if they were to be included in a cumulative index).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn26" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn26">26</a></sup> Was an entry for ‘elisions’ really necessary? It relates to one sentence: ‘Elisions should be filed as printed, ignoring punctuation (e.g. Who’s Who is filed \[as\] though spelled Whos Who).’ And wouldn’t a _see_ crossreference from ‘filing’ to ‘alphabetization’ have been more useful than including one entry under ‘filing’ simply because the text heading for this section of the article reads ‘Alphabetization (Filing)’?

## Letting a hundred flowers bloom: indexing virtuosity flourishes

> For just over two decades it was editorial policy to give each volume-indexer extensive freedom to display his/her personal virtuosity. Each compilation has its own special qualities, revealing fascinating variations of style, of technique, of decisionmaking; it has indeed been said with pride that these indexes are living proof that indexing is an art rather than a science. ([Gordon, 1983](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R10): 253)

While not disputing that indexing can be considered more of an art than a science,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn27" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn27">27</a></sup> and that no two indexes to the same publication will be identical, was the index to the only international journal devoted to indexing really the appropriate place to display ‘personal virtuosity’? Surely it was the perfect vehicle for demonstrating the stated aims of the fledgling society. Its very first constitution had proudly stated,

> The objects of the Society are: (a) to improve the standard of indexing and to secure some measure of uniformity in technique …<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn28" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn28">28</a></sup>

Despite his kind remarks about ‘indexers of distinction and long experience’, John Ainsworth Gordon (SI secretary during the later 1970s, chairman 1981–3 and sometime member of _The Indexer_ editorial board) had frequently voiced his concerns about variability and inconsistencies from one index to the next.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn29" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn29">29</a></sup> While not going so far as to criticize the indexes (and by implication the indexers), the main focus of his 1983 article was on the practicability of merging the existing indexes into a cumulative index, the need for which was becoming ever more pressing. The run of back issues was increasing and various milestones, such as the SI’s twenty-first anniversary, had been and gone. Some 20 years later, on taking over the editorship of _The Indexer_, Maureen MacGlashan was astonished to find ‘that each annual index was being produced as an independent item with no thought being given to how it might fit into a consolidated version’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn30" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn30">30</a></sup>

### ’Tis an unweeded garden

As a regular user of the indexes, Gordon had first raised his concern about inconsistencies with the then editor, Leonard Montague (Monty) Harrod, back in 1975. A year later, referring to _The Times_ leader article quoted above, he wrote,

> As the journal is, so to speak, the Holy Writ of Indexing, its own indexes should be models of the art and technique of indexing … I find them less helpful than I could wish. Too often, also, I come across points of detail which do not conform with the criteria laid down by the Board of Assessors. It is probably both heresy and treason to say this, but I really don’t think the indexes adequately reflect the Society’s own standards.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn31" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn31">31</a></sup>

Sadly, this fell on deaf ears. But Gordon was nothing if not persistent, raising the issue with several prominent SI members, including G. Norman Knight himself,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn32" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn32">32</a></sup> who agreed that some entries were ‘pretty terrible’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn33" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn33">33</a></sup> In a letter to David Pygott, Gordon enumerated several types of inconsistencies (‘disastrous shortcomings’) in the first nine volume indexes, correctly identifying one of the key problems – the absence of a standard list of subject headings. ‘There is no evidence that the slightest attempt has ever been made to apply this basic principle’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn34" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn34">34</a></sup> This was despite the existence of guidance on periodical indexing not only in the relevant British Standard (BS 3700), the preparation and indexing of which had involved the Society, but also in numerous articles in _The Indexer_ (e.g. [Ferriday, 1964](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R8); [Holmstrom, 1972](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R11)),<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn35" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn35">35</a></sup> in Knight’s _Training in Indexing_ (1969) and in [Collison (1972)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R5). He also suggested that the indexes would not pass muster if considered by the Board of Assessors,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn36" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn36">36</a></sup> though admitted that ‘the elder brethren of the Society seem to regard it as heresy and treason to criticise the journal’s indexes’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn37" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn37">37</a></sup> What is interesting to note is that until these inconsistencies were pointed out to them, it seems that none of these senior SI members had actually looked at the indexes in any detail and were unaware of their deficiencies.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn38" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn38">38</a></sup> One might ask, was anyone except Gordon using these indexes? This issue is touched on below.

Even a cursory inspection of these indexes shows just how much variation there was, not only in terms of layout (e.g. set out versus run on, capitalization, hyphens versus en dashes as concatenators), but also in subject headings (including adjusting the word order of article titles to bring a significant word to the beginning) and the depth of indexing. The idea that the existing indexes could be combined to form the basis of a cumulative index has never been realistic, but as we shall see, this was not always seen as an impediment.

Gordon’s next step was to produce a report setting out the problems with the first nine volume indexes, which was widely circulated, not only to Harrod, as editor, but also to Ken Bakewell (chair) and members of the SI Council and publications board.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn39" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn39">39</a></sup> He was keen to recommend that a cumulative index (1958–78) be produced to commemorate the Society’s twenty-first anniversary, but pointed out that a ‘collation’ of the volume indexes would produce ‘a patchwork cumulative index’, full of inconsistencies and lacking in balance. His criticisms can be summarized as:

•

inconsistent subject headings (see [Table 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#T1))

•

use of article titles (or words from titles) for headings

•

main articles not distinguished from ‘snippets’

•

‘over-indexing’ from Volume 6 onwards.

As in his later article ([Gordon, 1983](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R10)), and always courteous, he refrained from criticizing individual indexes, but warned that ‘if it should occur to anyone outside the Society to scrutinise our indexes, the Society’s image as the guardian of high indexing standards could be subject to most damaging public comment’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn40" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn40">40</a></sup>

Gordon was not alone in expressing enthusiasm for a cumulative index while at the same time appreciating the difficulties involved. ‘Cumulative index to Vols 1–10 – yes please. (I shall be v. interested to see how it turns out, when so many hands have been at work on the volume indexes)’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn41" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn41">41</a></sup>

## Mapping the terrain: towards a cumulative index

### Let’s get our bearings: guidelines and thesaurus

Gordon’s persistence seemed to pay off; Harrod admitted to being aware of the variations in the indexes, excusing it as showing that ‘indexing is a personal practice and not a science’. More significantly, he added, ‘I think it is time we drew up a set of rules … and that it would be a good thing to have a 10-vol. index compiled anew’, to be compiled according to these rules.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn42" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn42">42</a></sup> He embarked on preparing guidelines for the indexer of Volume 10 (1976–7), who later admitted to having been unable to follow them in their entirety (and also considered them to be incomplete). She pointed out that indexing _The Indexer_ was a very challenging task and that it was easy to criticize someone else’s work. She also agreed wholeheartedly with Gordon that uniformly high quality and consistency from one year to the next were vital, and that the best indexer for the job should be commissioned, rather than a willing volunteer.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn43" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn43">43</a></sup>

Meanwhile, the publications board agreed to recommend Council approve the preparation and publication of a cumulative index for Volumes 1 to 10, estimating that the cost for 1,000 copies (£950, being £750 for printing and production, £200 for the indexer) would be recoverable from sales.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn44" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn44">44</a></sup> It is not clear on what basis the indexer’s fee was estimated, or whether it was seen as only a token payment. Importantly, a set of ‘house rules’ should be drawn up. Unaware that Harrod was already doing this, Gordon asked three experienced members of the Council and publications board if they would be willing to draft a set of rules, or at least offer some advice on what ought to be included.

Although a set of ‘house rules’ failed to materialize, both John Thornton and Anthony Raven commented on the weaknesses of the existing indexes and provided advice on a possible cumulation. Thornton’s comments were particularly pertinent, including:

•

Compile a thesaurus and expand it over time.

•

Re-index the previous volumes for the cumulation.

•

Don’t clutter up the index with ‘red herrings’ and passing mentions.

•

A journal index is not used in the same way as a book index. ‘Generally speaking, one does not approach it as a source of reference in the same way as an encyclopedia or a textbook’.

•

Some of the indexes were too ‘fussy’. ‘A large index is not necessarily a good one … some features need not be indexed in depth.’

•

Topics relating to the Society should be kept together, not scattered under ‘Council’, etc.

On length and ‘clutter’, Thornton pointed out that under his editorship, costs had dictated that the index be restricted to a four-page insert, which he felt was perfectly adequate. (These were shorter issues, of course, with less content.) He singled out the detailed indexing of book reviews for particular criticism, regarding entries under authors, titles and reviewers’ names as excessive.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn45" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn45">45</a></sup>

In addition to commenting on the difficulties of establishing standardized terminology, Raven’s comments were more prescriptive, focusing on specific details of what should and should not be indexed. These can be summarized as:

•

Annual and cumulative indexes are different and should be regarded as separate tasks (eg some topics might need different treatment in a cumulation because of the quantity of references).

•

Articles should be indexed under title, author and subject.

•

Letters should be indexed under author and subject (and ‘letters’).

•

Book reviews should be indexed under title, author and reviewer.

•

‘Fillers’ should be indexed by subject, author and perhaps title.

•

Covers and adverts should _not_ be indexed.

•

Various aspects of SI would probably be best treated as main headings with cross-references from SI.

•

The decision on whether or not to invert (e.g. Assessors, Board of) should be made pragmatically.

He also set out detailed recommendations on typography and emphasized the importance of specific entries rather than what he referred to as ‘synthetic indexing’ – by which he meant a classified approach, gathering different aspects of a topic under a broader heading. But he felt that synthetic entries could be useful, provided cross-references were used (rather than duplicating everything under the overarching heading).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn46" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn46">46</a></sup>

It can be seen that there is a certain amount of disagreement between the Thornton and Raven comments, particularly in the level of detail envisaged. Harrod’s guidelines also diverged from these in several respects. It was not until his retirement as editor in 1978 that this document came to light and received wider scrutiny. Ken Bakewell (then SI chair) questioned in particular the recommendation to use words from the titles and text of articles as index entries. (Harrod had also suggested inverting article titles to bring a significant word to the front.) Fourteen years earlier, in bemoaning the poor standard of subject indexing in journals, [Peter Ferriday (1964)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R8), editor of the British Humanities Index, had railed against the use of titles and words from titles rather than proper subject entries, pointing out that although readers remembered book titles, they were much less likely to remember titles of articles.

> But the majority of users must surely be assumed to use an index to locate an article about something or by somebody. The author entry is a straightforward matter; the problem lies in the subject entry … The required development would seem \[to lie in\] the abandonment of the chance involved in such notions as ‘significant words’ \[from titles\] and ‘key words’.

Ferriday’s approach would appear to be the more pragmatic, avoiding the danger of users becoming lost in the forest, unable to see the wood for the trees. (And the use of fanciful titles, as in the present article, gives no indication of the subject.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn47" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn47">47</a></sup>) Experienced journal indexes tend to agree with this approach,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn48" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn48">48</a></sup> but it is worth noting that early SI recommendations for periodical indexes ([Society of Indexers, 1960](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R16)) had included the statement ‘Articles in journals should be indexed under authors, titles, significant words in titles, and under the subjects dealt with in the text.’ (Guidance on periodical indexing will be considered further in a subsequent article.)

Of course, no two indexers (let alone three or four) will completely agree on what would constitute an ideal index to _The Indexer_; what is important is consistency from year to year, though Gordon also felt that the index should approach as closely as possible _model_ standards.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn49" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn49">49</a></sup> However, as Thornton had already pointed out, reaching a consensus was not going to be easy: ‘Members of our Society could argue for months over what constitutes a _model_ index, and will do the same over a cumulative index to _The Indexer_.’<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn50" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn50">50</a></sup>

The quest for a clear set of more than rudimentary guidelines continued, as chronicled in correspondence between John Gordon and Hazel Bell. Frustration at the lack of progress was very evident in Gordon’s reference to ‘the incompetence of our Society (for over two decades!) in failing to apply the known principles and techniques of periodical indexing to its own journal’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn51" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn51">51</a></sup> Yet again he referred to the need for a thesaurus, recalling the advice of [Robert Collison (1972](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R5): 126): ‘It is therefore essential to build up a standard list of subject headings to ensure uniformity in every instalment of the index, but this will not prevent or preclude revision’. Gordon suggested that such a list should be compiled by one individual, but subject to scrutiny by several others to reflect ‘the combined wisdom of the Soc. … \[though\] a committee would only produce some wishy-washy compromise’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn52" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn52">52</a></sup>

To this end, in 1978 it was suggested that the existing guidelines (presumably Harrod’s) should be circulated to appropriate registered indexers,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn53" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn53">53</a></sup> such as indexers of previous volumes, for comments, revision and expansion, and that the ‘desirability of compiling a special thesaurus … receive attention’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn54" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn54">54</a></sup> A year later, the editorial board suggested that Gordon should collaborate with the indexer to Volume 12, concentrating on consistency of headings and subheadings, especially relating to the terms ‘index’, ‘indexer(s)’, ‘indexes’ and ‘indexing’, based on an analysis of the previous 11 volumes (see also [Table 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#T1)).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn55" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn55">55</a></sup> In April 1980 it was further suggested that this analysis would establish a basis for future consistency and that the thesaurus prepared by ASLIB might be useful for this exercise.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn56" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn56">56</a></sup>

Looking back, it seems extraordinary that although the idea of producing a thesaurus for indexing was being discussed at this time, it apparently came to nothing. Indeed, Ken Bakewell went so far as to suggest that although it would be a ‘lovely idea’, it would be a ‘mammoth task’ if done properly. He even suggested that it was not even necessary to prepare a more modest list of preferred terms with cross-references.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn57" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn57">57</a></sup> To anyone involved with periodical indexing, especially when cumulations are anticipated, a standard list of subject headings (as advocated by Collison back in 1972) is a given. Inevitably, of course, such a list will develop as disciplines evolve; new terminology succeeds old, new research subjects come along, new cross-references are needed.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn58" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn58">58</a></sup>

By 1991 there was still no sign of the hoped-for thesaurus. However, the indexes for Volumes 15–19 (1986/7–1994/5) were being prepared by the same indexer, leading to much more consistency, although one member of the editorial board was surprised that he had not yet prepared a thesaurus.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn59" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn59">59</a></sup> There was also some progress towards agreeing guidelines. In consultation with eight other indexers, the indexer of Volume 12 (1980–1) attempted to prepare detailed guidelines to be used for future volumes (and therefore facilitate cumulation). Needless to say, there was considerable disagreement – not just differences of emphasis but also contradictory views over many points – and the indexer herself made the final decision, in consultation with the editor. As reported by [Gordon (1983)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R10), the journal’s editorial board approved this as the style to be adopted for future volumes, but readers of _The Indexer_ were also invited to express their views:

> User research in the past has been concerned mainly with the less experienced users … For the present purpose information is sought from really seasoned index users, including those who are themselves index compilers, with the practical aim of providing the most suitable indexes to _The Indexer._<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn60" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn60">60</a></sup>

The response was distinctly underwhelming, leading to the assumption that there was widespread support for the style established in Volume 12 (readers’ apathy or indifference apparently not being considered). However, one reader, no less an authority than Hans Wellisch (who later wrote one of the classic indexing textbooks, _Indexing from A to Z_ (1991)), had also expressed a wish that ‘the editorial board will stipulate groundrules for future indexes with a view to making them as uniform as possible so that other indexers may learn from what we are doing in our own backyard’ ([Wellisch, 1982](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R17a): 48). He regarded the Volume 11 index as ‘exemplary’, noting with approval that ‘it uses a bare minimum of initial prepositions in subheadings, but when they do appear, they are alphabetized like any other word’. He hoped this principle would be followed consistently (but this did not prove to be the case). He also criticized the Volume 10 index, deploring the use of subheadings beginning with ‘and’ rather than more informative terminology. These points were raised in a series of ‘letters to the editor’ in 1981 and 1982 mentioning _The Indexer_ indexes in responding to a controversial article by [Wellisch (1980)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R17) on alphabetizing prepositions. Again the correspondence highlighted the lack of agreement that has been a constant theme. [John Gordon (1981)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R9), concerned as ever about consistency, pointed out that in fact ‘_Indexer_ indexes lack (more’s the pity) the uniformity of alphabetization Hans Wellisch claims to find in them’. [Geoffrey Dixon (1981)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R6) supported Wellisch’s view, but also argued for concise subheadings, with minimal use of prepositions (a style he was to follow in his own indexes to _The Indexer_ some years later).

Thankfully, a period of reasonable stability had ensued, with much less variation in layout, punctuation and content: set-out layout and use of small capitals (later capitals) for regular features (e.g. book reviews, indexes past) made for easier navigation around the index, as did header letters. One might disagree with the instruction that advertisements should be included, but be thankful that office holders should not be individually indexed. In addition, there was more standardization of terminology and judicious use of cross-references, which was particularly important as computerization was looming ever larger.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn61" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn61">61</a></sup>

However, the style adopted in Volume 12 (and approved by the editorial board) was not followed in its entirety, and despite the very welcome consistency of Volumes 15–19 (1986–95), the treatment of the metatopic (indexing) should be noted. Other than where the terms ‘indexers’, ‘indexes’ and ‘indexing’ appeared as the first words of titles, the indexer chose not to use these as subject headings, advising users in an introductory note ‘to seek more specific headings’. This practice was not always taken up by subsequent indexers. A later set of guidelines, drawn up in 2003 by the indexer of the final four individual volumes to be separately indexed (1998–2005) and approved by the SI publications committee, simply recommended that the ‘indexing’ heading should not be ‘overloaded’. Subheadings should be confined to more general topics such as ‘as freelance business’ and ‘history of’, with a cross-reference advising readers to look under more specific headings for specialized aspects of indexing. Other than this, there was still no suggestion that a standard list of subject headings be built up. In many respects it was similar to the earlier guidelines in terms of layout and typography and in continuing to recommend including title entries (though, reflecting more recent conventions, it recommended not inverting headings beginning with ‘A’ and ‘The’ but ignoring these in sorting). It also specifically mentioned indexing topics covered _within_ articles.

Treatment of the metatopic was also among the criticisms of [Kingsley Siebel (1991)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R15), as well as the apparently inconsistent level of detail to which articles were indexed. In his response, the indexer, [Geoffrey Dixon (1991)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R7), took on board some of the comments, justified his approach to book reviews by referring to precedent, agreed that the treatment of editorials had been rather confused, and confirmed that in future he would not breach his stated principle of not using the term ‘indexing’ or any of its cognates as a main heading. However, he was at pains to point out that ‘if indexing is an art there will always be room for disagreement. Also problematical is the question of to what extent a journal indexer should plough his own furrow rather than accept the constraints of precedent’ ([Dixon, 1991](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R7): 268). Why was there this reluctance to accept that although there might be disagreements, these should be ironed out and guidelines established?

### Taking a detour: the ‘Contents by category’

Discussions about the practicalities of producing a cumulative index and the need for consistency rumbled on through the 1980s and into the 1990s (along with regular discussions on the indexer’s fee), as documented in the minutes of _The Indexer_ editorial board. It is clear that although the majority of board members were in favour of the project in principle, enthusiasm was not universal. Apart from the difficulties of actually undertaking it, the lack of agreement on what it should include, and its likely cost, some questioned whether it was really needed at all. It was not until the late 1990s that the project again received significant attention (see below).

Frustrated at the lack of progress, in 1991 Hazel Bell took an alternative approach, and began to prepare a classified list of articles in _The Indexer_, which could be useful for publicity and for researchers, if not as a preliminary stage in preparing a cumulative index. Reactions to the initial drafts were muted, editorial board chairman Ian Crane feeling that it ‘did not appear to be either an index or a contents list’, did not follow the British Standard on indexes (BS3700) and did not yet include the first ten volumes.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn62" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn62">62</a></sup> However, he acknowledged that ‘this bit of really hard work will be a great boon in due course … but I fear it does not go far enough yet’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn63" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn63">63</a></sup>

An expanded version covering 1958–95 was eventually published as a supplement to the April 1997 _Indexer_, with a detailed introductory note explaining that it covered major articles (not reviews, conference and awards reports, news items and other short pieces). It also included a table setting out the classification used (divided into 12 main sections) and a list of the page numbers beginning each issue of the journal. In each section articles were listed chronologically. Annual updates were included in _The Indexer_ until 2003, after which the whole sequence moved online and is now updated after the publication of each issue of the journal.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn64" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn64">64</a></sup> Confounding the earlier doubts of the editorial board, and although one might wish for a more detailed breakdown of some sections, this has proved to be a useful resource.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn65" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn65">65</a></sup> Indeed, at its November 2002 meeting, the publications committee wondered whether a cumulative index might be an unnecessary luxury, given that the classified contents included all the major articles.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn66" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn66">66</a></sup>

### Back on track: re-indexing for a cumulative index

As already noted, it had long been recognized that inconsistency and lack of guidelines were the main impediments to compiling a cumulative index from the existing volume indexes. As Hazel Bell pointed out in 1989,

> None of the volume indexes had been done on computer. In view of this and the full comparative analysis of the variations of style compiled in 1977 by John Gordon, a cumulative index would really have to be redone entirely.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn67" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn67">67</a></sup>

The sentiment was echoed two years later by another editorial board member:

> Cumulation of past volumes of _The Indexer_ would be very difficult, of course, as all were done to different ideas and standards. It would really have to be done again from scratch by one worker … we ought perhaps to be looking ahead … and taking the opportunity to compile a thesaurus that would govern the structure of future indexes, whether annual or cumulative.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn68" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn68">68</a></sup>

She also suggested that the volume indexes should be prepared using MACREX (one of the indexing programs available at the time), to enable setting from disk, and ‘linking’ a thesaurus to MACREX in some way to prevent inadvertently ‘illegal’ entries being made.

Based on the time taken to prepare the volume indexes (mentioned above), various estimates of the likely cost of re-indexing from scratch had been made in the 1980s:

•

Volumes 1–20 at 4.1 pages per hour – nearly £6,000<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn69" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn69">69</a></sup>

•

Volumes 1–15 – £5,000–6,000<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn70" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn70">70</a></sup>

•

Volumes 1–15 (2,860 pages of text) at five pages per hour – £4,576 (at £8 per hour).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn71" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn71">71</a></sup>

Not surprisingly, such costs were not considered to be economically feasible (and did not include the cost of printing), but on the face of it these estimates themselves seem somewhat inflated, even in terms of back-of-the-book indexing speeds. And those of us who have prepared cumulative journal indexes would normally expect to index far more than four or five pages an hour.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn72" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn72">72</a></sup> As already noted, the detailed volume indexes seem to have set a precedent; it was assumed that the cumulative index would be indexed to the same level of detail, and including the ‘fillers’ and ‘snippets’ that led to what Thornton called ‘fussy’ indexing’ (see above).

Another estimate came from Geoffrey Dixon, who was indexing Volumes 15–19 with a view to these eventually forming the basis for a cumulative index. Experimenting with merging and editing sections of the volume indexes he had already prepared, he estimated that a cumulative index for those four volumes alone would take him about 40–50 hours (including the time necessary to add the entries for the earlier volumes into his indexing software).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn73" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn73">73</a></sup>

Anxious to promote the journal, but accepting that the cost of producing a good cumulative index was considered excessive, in 1995 the indefatigable Hazel Bell proposed that the Society might simply publish a booklet consisting of the first 20 indexes, together with [John Gordon’s (1983)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R10) article outlining the problems faced in cumulating indexes. She also suggested that this could be supplemented further by including the classified contents list (see above).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn74" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn74">74</a></sup> This project was not, however, pursued.

### Here be dragons

By the later 1990s, the idea of preparing a cumulative index was again being discussed and a small working party of experienced indexers began drawing up a detailed plan for the project. Although (inevitably) there were different views on points of detail, it was soon agreed that there should be three separate indexes: authors, subjects and book reviews. Aware of the inconsistencies between the existing indexes, the preferred option for the subject index was to start a new index from scratch rather than combine the original indexes by scanning the early volumes. To reduce the work involved, it was also suggested that three different people could work on the project, one on each section.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn75" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn75">75</a></sup> After further amendments to the proposed specification, an advertisement (see [Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#F2)) was placed in the autumn 2000 issue of the SI newsletter, _SIdelights_, inviting tenders for the project. The challenge for the indexer would be to work out the best way of achieving this, and whether digitizing the existing indexes, complete with their many unnecessary entries, was going to be the most efficient method.

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2022.3/asset/3416609e-ed94-4836-a7fe-b51f03d5f9c7/assets/graphic/indexer_2022_3_fig2.jpg)

Figure 2. The advertisement inviting tenders for the cumulative index

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#F2)

The specification clearly stated that three sequences were expected:

•

authors

◦

authors of articles (plus titles of their articles)

◦

book reviewers (page numbers only, not details of books reviewed)

•

book reviews

◦

author and title of each book (with name of reviewer in parentheses)

•

subjects

◦

main subject(s) of each article

◦

additional entries for important additional subjects (but not ‘full indexing’ depth)

◦

photographs, or other significant illustrations.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the advertisement resulted in a deafening silence, but keen to go ahead the committee invited the director of an indexing company with experience of large projects to submit a quote. It was at this stage, perhaps, that alarm bells should have begun to ring. Not only was the quote alarmingly vague (200–400 hours, i.e. £3,000–£6,000 at prevailing recommended hourly rates), but a preference for scanning was expressed (while agreeing that some re-indexing might be required), and for one single sequence rather than three. Nevertheless, a contract was signed and a sample was submitted, consisting of indexes to three volumes, scanned, imported into indexing software and merged. Almost impossible to check in its unedited form, it amply demonstrated the problems of merging existing indexes: ‘headings were idiosyncratic, alphabetization was inconsistent, etc. … it might have been more effective to re-index the whole run of volumes’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn76" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn76">76</a></sup> In addition, since there had been a tendency for over-indexing in the existing volumes (as noted above), it was likely that over the whole run of the journal many unnecessary entries would be scanned.

Before an edited sample could be submitted, it transpired that the scanning process was continuing, absorbing a considerable number of the anticipated hours. Concerned that editing the merged indexes into an index of appropriate quality within the agreed time frame (and budget) seemed unlikely, the project was put on hold and the contract was eventually terminated. Following a series of fractious emails and meetings, the SI grievance procedure was invoked.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn77" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn77">77</a></sup> Reporting in September 2002, the grievance committee concluded that there had been ‘elements of mis-understanding and mis-interpretation on both sides’ and that the contract had been loosely worded and ‘poorly managed by both sides in its execution’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn78" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn78">78</a></sup> Certainly the whole sorry episode was not an experience one would want to repeat.

This was not quite the end of the story. Although the publications committee felt that a cumulative index might be an unnecessary luxury and the idea should be put on hold for the time being, an ‘independently produced’ cumulative index was advertised in the April 2003 _Indexer_ (with a disclaimer distancing the Society from it).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn79" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn79">79</a></sup> The earlier misgivings were amply justified by [Pat Booth’s (2003)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R3) scathing review of the index in the next issue. While welcoming its publication, and extolling the virtues of cumulative indexes in general, she was forced to conclude that it provided only ‘rough and ready access to much of the valuable content of 40 years of _The Indexer_’ and that ‘the lack of harmonized headings and subheadings, the inconsistencies, gaps, and errors – mean that it will not be regarded as a model index’. However, as two previous editors have attested, ‘rough and ready access’ may be sufficient for some purposes. Hazel Bell finds it ‘extremely helpful when doing any work on _The Indexer_ – it works perfectly using SEARCH!’,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn80" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn80">80</a></sup> while Maureen MacGlashan often uses it for tracking things down, finding it particularly useful now that she has it in a format that she can use in her indexing software.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn81" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn81">81</a></sup>

## Charting a new course: not out of the woods yet

_The Indexer_ website first went live in 2005, soon after Maureen MacGlashan had taken on the editorship of the journal, and at this point the printed volume indexes were discontinued in favour of a comprehensive online cumulative index, to be built up on an issue-by-issue basis, with previous volumes incorporated retrospectively, as time permitted.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn82" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn82">82</a></sup> The first instalment duly appeared in 2006. At the same time, back issues of the journal were being digitized; eventually the complete run of the journal was available online. In the event, although the separate author and title indexes are regularly updated and cover all issues from 1958 onwards, the cumulative index only covers the period from 1996 to 2010. Aware of the importance of having a journal index hyperlinked to the actual articles, or at least to the relevant issue, but frustrated at the difficulties of achieving this, Maureen MacGlashan paused the updating until this could be addressed. More recently she admitted that ‘it may be an unrealistic luxury … I think the author/title/classified contents do an excellent job’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#fn83" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn83">83</a></sup>

Is this the end of the story? Time will tell. This winding journey, highlighting some of the deep-rooted problems that have impeded progress towards a cumulative index time and time again, has aimed to stimulate discussion on the way forward. Having identified the root of the problem, can we clear some of the dead wood, let some light in and allow new shoots to emerge? There is no doubt that back issues of _The Indexer_ are a rich source of information on indexes, indexers and indexing. But we have little or no data on how this resource is mined and how it could be used more effectively. It is, after all, one of the golden rules of indexing, that the needs of the user should be paramount. As we continue the journey in future articles, we will look more generally at journal indexing and at user behaviour in our quest to provide an index to _The Indexer_ that will withstand the sharpest scrutiny and of which we can be justly proud as an example of good practice.

SI Council meeting, Minute 81/53 (24 November 1981). Interestingly, this was not agreed unanimously, some members feeling that it was an honour and privilege to prepare the index (really?!) and that it was just another way in which members offered their services to the Society in a voluntary capacity.

11

Remuneration for the volume indexer was a frequent item on the agenda of _The Indexer_ editorial board throughout the 1980s and well into the 1990s, with either a ceiling or a fixed fee being agreed, regardless of the prevailing recommended rate and the number of hours worked.

12

During this period the suggested hourly rate was gradually increased from £4.75 to £6.75.

Only a few of the volume indexes are available on _The Indexer_ website. The information presented here is from inspection of the printed copies.

16

The change in layout from run-on to set-out subheadings in volume 10 and from volume 12 onwards also contributed to an increase in length but made the indexes more user-friendly.

17

Some were, of course, of only marginal interest to indexers, and in recent years the number of book reviews has declined dramatically. This may also reflect the absence of a reviews editor and the difficulty sometimes experienced in both obtaining relevant books from publishers and finding willing volunteers to review them.

18

The usefulness of this practice was questioned by John Thornton (see below under ‘Let’s get our bearings: guidelines and thesaurus’).

Detailed indexing of an organization’s newsletter is helpful in tracing the history of that organization and its members. Cumulative indexes to the SI newsletter (_SIdelights_) have been prepared since 1999 and [Russell (2018)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R14) reports on the ANZSI newsletter indexing project.

The SI Council (Minute 95/33) supported the view that _The Indexer_ should better represent indexing worldwide with more development as a learned journal (4 May 1995).

23

Though indexing authorities are not in agreement over this, an issue to be considered in a subsequent article in this series. Both [Collison (1972)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R5) and [Knight (1979)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R13) appear to suggest that ideally an article would be indexed in much the same way as a book, while [Wellisch (1991)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.3#core-R18) seems to recommend indexing at article level. The 1960 British Standard also indicates that a book will be indexed in more detail than a journal.

24

Ann Hudson (email correspondence, 15 October 2021) disagrees that ‘journal indexing is normally at the article level’. She states that all her journal indexes (all to ‘learned journals’), ‘have been indexed to a depth more or less comparable to book indexing’. But she adds the important caveat that ‘one gets to know one’s journals and their readers’ interests’.

SI publications board, Minute 39 (3 February 1977). By the time of the board’s meeting on 23 August 1977 (Minute 65), the cost for 1,000 copies of a 48-page cumulative index had increased to £1,350 (£1,050 for print and production £300 for the indexer) but it was expected to sell at £2 each. Although agreeing that, were this to go ahead, work should start as soon as possible (to be ready for the 1978 conference and twenty-first anniversary), the difficulty of assessing demand in advance and therefore whether it would break even ‘prevented agreement on any specific recommendation’.
