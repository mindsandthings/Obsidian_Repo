The Association of Southern African Indexers and Bibliographers (ASAIB) hosted its first online conference on 20 May 2021. The conference theme was ‘Decades of Indexing Specialisation’. Considering the fact that many people suffer from screen fatigue during online conferences, the ASAIB Executive Committee decided to have a morning-only conference, which included four papers, the ASAIB AGM and awards. Unfortunately, a fifth speaker had to withdraw as she contracted COVID-19 and her doctor ordered complete bedrest.

The four papers that were presented focused on interesting topics and the presentations were of a uniformly high standard. They focused on the following areas:

•

continuing professional development (CPD) in keeping library and information science (LIS) practitioners and the LIS sector relevant in current times

•

indexing in the educational publishing industry in South Africa

•

the need for copyright reform in South Africa and the reasons for the delays in the reform

•

the Ultimate Human Race (i.e. the Comrades Marathon) memories and the place the race’s archives has in preserving these memories.

To conclude the morning, the ASAIB indexing and bibliography awards were announced. This year, Elsabé Nell received the ASAIB Award for Best Indexer 2021 for her index to _Decolonisation as democratisation: global insights into the South African experience_, edited by Siseko H. Kumalo (published by HSRC Press in 2021). Elsabé works in the Department of Library Services at UNISA and has been indexing since 2013, specializing in arts and humanities, religion and social sciences. The runner-up was Rita Sephton for her index to _The unicorn baby_ by Roxanne Atkinson (published by Jonathan Ball in 2021). Rita has a degree in English and communication and has been indexing for around five years, combining it with copy-editing. Her wide range of subject interests include history, travel, law, medicine and health, education, engineering, art and culture. Abdul Bemath, who sadly died in 2020, posthumously received the award for the best bibliography.

Although a very small event, the 2021 ASAIB conference was a great success and with the successful outcomes of this very first online event, the ASAIB Executive Committee is now considering offering online indexing training.
