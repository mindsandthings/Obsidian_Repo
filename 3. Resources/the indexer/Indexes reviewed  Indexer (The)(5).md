Publication: The Indexer: The International Journal of Indexing

Volume 39, Number 1

These extracts from reviews do not pretend to represent a complete survey of all reviews in journals and newspapers. We offer only a selection from quotations that readers have sent in. Our reproduction of comments is not a stamp of approval from _The Indexer_ upon the reviewer’s assessment of an index. Extracts are arranged alphabetically under the names of publishers, within the sections: Indexes praised; Two cheers!; Indexes censured; Indexes omitted.

## Indexes praised

**Bloomsbury**: _The Atlantic in world history 1490–1830_, by Trevor Burnard (2019, xx + 320 pp, £75). Rev. by Xabier Lamikiz, _International Journal of Maritime History_, **32**(3).

The book includes further reading lists at the end of each chapter. It also has carefully presented maps and images and an excellent analytical index.

**Bloomsbury**: _Fire metaphors: discourses of awe and authority_, by Jonathan Charteris-Black (2017, vii + 238 pp, £95 hbk, £31.30 ebook). Rev. by Katherine Quigley, _Discourse & Society_ **31**(4), 2020.

The volume consists of 10 interesting and challenging chapters, divided into three sections: Fire in Culture, Language and Thought; Fire in Religious Discourse; and Fire in Political Discourse. There is also a useful index of the 63 conceptual metaphors, metonyms and frames in the book, some of which are original to Charteris-Black, for example, UNCONTROLLED EMOTION IS EXTREME TEMPERATURE. These in themselves are an important contribution to the field of metaphor studies.

**Jonathan Cape**: _Inside story_, by Martin Amis (2020, 522 pp, £20). Rev. by Nicholas Lezard, _The Spectator_, 26 September 2020.

_Inside Story_ is called, on the front cover, which boasts a very charming photograph of the author and Christopher Hitchens, a novel. It also has a good and comprehensive (14-page) index. I’ve been a book reviewer for 35 years and I’ve lost count of the number of times I have wished, professionally, for larger novels to have an index; but I’m not sure I can remember seeing one before. A non-facetious one, that is. This index is very much non-facetious.

**Faber & Faber**: _Tom Stoppard: a life_, by Hermione Lee (2020, 977 pp, £30). Rev. by Jeremy Treglown, _Literary Review_, 490, October 2020.

… the twenty-eight-page, two-column index in seven-point type is an essential tool.

**Hardball Press**: _The union member’s complete guide: everything you want and need to know about working union_, by Michael Mauer (2nd ed., 2019, 190 pp, $15). Rev. by Helena Worthen, _Labor Studies Journal_, **45**(4).

The new edition does not have the old edition’s color illustrations but has kept the good cartoons by Kelley Bell. The index is shorter but seems to have the items you’d want to look up most often.

**History Press**: _Jeoffry: the poet’s cat_, by Oliver Soden (2020, 185 pp, £16.99). Rev. by \[SI president\] Sam Leith, _The Spectator_, 3 October 2020.

It is also, of course, a work of imaginative reconstruction, of fiction, even as its scholarly apparatus – endnotes, footnotes and index – bespeaks scrupulous research.

**Norman Publishing**: _Sir William Osler: an encyclopedia_, ed. by Charles S. Bryan (2020, 967 pp). Rev. by Christopher Gardner-Thorpe, _Journal of Medical Biography_ (n.d.).

One advantage of an encyclopedia is that an index is not essential since the entries are in alphabetical order and this means that dipping into the volume is an easier way ahead rather than a steady read from page one to the final 967th page, a remarkable publishing achievement. Nevertheless an index is included and takes the reader to the finer points of the text provided by the many contributors worldwide and edited by Bryan to result in a massive tome that will be not only a most useful reference work but also will provide much enjoyment from browsing.

## Two cheers!

**CRC Press**: _The illustrated dictionary of toxicologic pathology and safety science_, ed. by P. S. Sahota et al. (2019, 671 pp, £180). Rev. by Judit E. Markovits, _Veterinary Pathology_, 2020, **57**(4).

So often, the index of reference books is not user-friendly, but that is not the case with the illustrated dictionary. The index successfully directs the reader to the dictionary entries as well as the appendices covering the entry in question. It would be worthwhile to start with the index and visit all entries listed to gain full understanding of the subject instead of looking up the dictionary entries only …

The digital version of the book is in ‘reflowable e Textbook’ (ePub) format with its advantages and disadvantages. E-books are still in their infancy and both publishers and readers are trying to find the best way to produce and use e-books … In the index, the hyperlinks worked well when directing from an entry to a preferred term within the index itself. However, the hyperlinks did not work when directing to a specific page for the entry of interest, and the application locked up repeatedly, thus the index could not be used as intended. Editors certainly are not at fault for the shortcomings of the e-book version, and these comments are only to indicate opportunities for the future for publishers to consider.

**Polity Press**: _Riding for Deliveroo: resistance in the new economy_, by Callum Cant (2020, 198 pp, $19.95). Rev. by David J. Nemeth, _Economic Development Quarterly_, **34**(4).

My paperback edition of _RfD_ was remarkably sturdy and legible, but devoid of maps, photos, and tables. Enlightening chapter notes were included, but the subject index – though useful – was minimal. The educational value of the engaging and well-written text alone proved priceless to me.

**Georg Thieme Verlag**: _Illustrated veterinary anatomical nomenclature_, by Gheorghe M. Constantinescu (4th ed., 2018, 620 pp, $174.99). Rev. by Donal O’Toole, _Journal of Veterinary Diagnostic Investigation_, 2020, **32**(4).

The extensive index may be unfamiliar for some readers, given that it relies on Latin for anatomical terms. It is nevertheless easy to navigate once you know that arteries are found under A or Aa, nuclei in the brain under Nucl, and so on. A separate short index translates common Latin used anatomically. Here one finds that _alveolus_ means bucket, _amygdala_ almond, and _vagus_ wandering. I was puzzled initially by the alternate definition of _filum terminale_, the tapered distal portion of the spinal cord. We Dubliners use this to describe the last movie of the evening. To Latinists, it is the terminal thread.

## Indexes censured

**Head of Zeus**: _The Hitler years: triumph 1933–1939_, by Frank McDonough (2019, 488 pp, £30). Rev. by Jane Caplan, _BBC History Magazine_, March 2020.

The index, which contains few references to important themes but focuses on the names of places, people and organisations, is of little help here. It is virtually impossible to break through the chronological wall. Readers are better served by the book’s lavish illustrations.

**Georg Olms Verlag**: _A maritime lexicon: Arabic nautical terminology in the Indian Ocean_, by Abdulrahman Al-Salimi and Eric Staples (2019, 641 pp, €88). Rev. by John P. Cooper, _International Journal of Maritime History_, 2020, **32**(3).

This is an Arabic–English lexicon: readers seeking the Arabic equivalent of an English term will struggle, since entries (and the ‘Translation Table’ at the back) are arranged by Arabic name (in Arabic alphabet and in transliteration) and following Arabic abjad order: the index is in Arabic only. Alessandro Ghidoni’s ‘Drawings’ section helps in this regard, at least as far as boat parts are concerned, but there is no reverse index to direct the non-Arabic-speaking reader to the appropriate entry.

**Palgrave Macmillan**: _Energy in Africa: policy, management and sustainability_, ed. by Sola Adesola and Feargal Brennan (2018, 247 pp, €114.39 hbk, €114.39pbk, €93.08 ebook). Rev. by Rashmi Rani Anand, _Insight on Africa_, **12**(2), 2020.

The demerit of the book is that thematic maps used are not very clear; font used in Index is not readable.

_Nose Dive_ will go right next to _On Food and Cooking_ on my reference shelf.

But uh oh. How I wish it had a better index.

For a book like this, the index needs to be meticulously complete – list every bold face term every time it appears – so readers can find what we are looking for. This one is surprisingly unhelpful.

I found this out because I forgot to write down the page number for the fatty acid excerpt shown above. I searched the index for most of the key words that appear in the clip: fatty acids, short and branched; butyric; methylbutyric; hexanoic; cheesy; interstellar space. No luck. I had to check through all of the fatty acid listings and finally found it under ‘fatty acids, and molecules in asteroids, 19.’ Oh. Asteroids.Silly me.

I also forgot to note the page for the CAFO quote. CAFO is not indexed at all, even though it appears in bold on the previous page, and neither does its definition, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation.

McGee refers frequently to ‘Hero Carbon,’ the atom basic to odiferous molecules. I couldn’t remember where he first used ‘Hero’ and tried to look it up. Not a chance.

This book deserves better, alas.

Penguin Press: this needs a fix, big time.

**Polity**: _Bauman: a biography_, by Izabela Wagner (2020, 510 pp, £25). Rev. by Sheila Fitzpatrick, _London Review of Books_, 10 September 2020.

How \[the Polish Jewish sociologist Zygmunt\] Bauman wrote has a chapter to itself (‘An Intellectual at Work’) but what he wrote is dealt with only in passing. There are no separate chapters or even index entries for such key works as _Modernity and the Holocaust_ or _Liquid Modernity_ (which, like several other of Bauman’s works cited in the text, has been accidentally left out of the bibliography).

**Shetland Times**: _Shetland and the Greenland whaling_, by Adrian Duncan (2019, xx + 631 pp, £45). Rev. by Michael P. Dyer, _International Journal of Maritime History_, **32**(2).

An awkward component to the arrangement of the book comes with vessel reference. Instead of including the vessel names in the index, Duncan has the whale ships listed by port, alphabetically, and then by the date where they appear in a chapter. Given time, and use, this arrangement will become second-nature to the users of this book. At first, however, it’s a bit confusing. Likewise, in the index, vessel names only appear after the name of the master, and there were some vessels referenced in the text which were not in the index.

## Indexes omitted

**Brepols**: _Astrometeorologia en al-Andalus y el Magrib entre los siglos VII y XV. El Kitāb al-amṭār wa l-asʿār (‘Libro de las lluvias y de los precios’) de Abū ʿAbd Allāh al-Baqqār (fl 1411–1418)_, ed. by Chedli Guesmi (2018, viii + 277 pp, €90). Rev. by Charles Burnett, _Journal for the History of Astronomy_, **51**(2).

An index would have been helpful.

**Cambridge Scholars Publishing**: _Eastern Orthodox Christianity and animal suffering: ancient voices in modern theology_, by Christina Nellist (2018, x + 416 pp, £54.99). Rev. by David Grumett, _Studies in Christian Ethics_ **33(**2).

This is Nellist’s PhD thesis produced at the University of Winchester and covers a wide range of animal welfare topics. It could have been shorter, and some busy readers might need to skim some material, and could have been aided by an index.

**Penguin Random House**: _Unnatural causes: the life and many deaths of Britain’s top forensic pathologist_, by Dr Richard Shepherd (2019, 445 pp, £20/£6). Rev. by Alec Samuels, _Medicine, Science and the Law_, 2020, **60**(4).

There is no index, which is a very considerable limitation.

**Sphere Books**: _Signs of murder: a small town in Scotland, a miscarriage of justice and the search for the truth_, by David Wilson (2020, 292 pp, £25). Rev. by Alec Samuels, _Medicine, Science and the Law_ (n.d.)

The book lacks pictures, which can give the ‘feeling’ to the story, maps and drawings which can assist in following what happened, an index which can assist reference and specific reference to the various court cases over the years.

**I. B. Tauris**: _How to look at stained glass: a guide to the church windows of England_, by Jane Brocket (2018, 230 pp, £12.99). Rev. by Graham Howes, _Theology_, **123**(5).

More crucially, especially for newcomers to stained glass, although there is one list of the excellent images accompanying the text, another of churches referred to, listed by county, and a third of the 50 sites the author would ‘recommend unreservedly’ (p. 210), there is, as yet, no general index that enables the novice reader to locate, swiftly and precisely, where a specific artist – whether Chagall or Clarke or Kempe – can be viewed and experienced in situ. Such a well-intentioned, intelligent and potentially valuable project as this deserves no less.

**Thames & Hudson**: _World War II infographics_, by Jean Lopez, Nicolas Aubin, Vincent Bernard and Nicolas Guillerat (2019, 192 pp, $40). Rev. by Timothy J. Demy, _Naval War College Review_, **73**(1), Winter 2020.

The book does not have an index.

**University Press of Mississippi**, _The complete folktales of A. N. Afanas’ev_, vols I and II, ed. by Jack V. Haney (vol. 1 2014, xxxvii + 511 pp, £75.56, vol. II 2015, 556 pp, £63.95). Rev. by Laura J. Olson, _Journal of American Folklore_ 133 (2020).

Haney’s translation differs in style and feel from the translation with which most people are familiar, Norbert Guterman’s 1945 translation (Pantheon Books) … While Guterman’s volume contains a rudimentary and inconsistent index, Haney’s translation is lacking an index, so it is sometimes hard to find the tale one needs. For this reason, an electronic edition of each volume, offered through the Kindle platform, may be a good choice for anyone who does not read Russian and wishes to use the book as a reference work.

## By the way …

**Little, Brown**: _Diary of an MP’s wife: inside and outside power_, by Sasha Swire (2020, 544 pp, £20). Rev. in _The Times_, 21 September 2020.

Lady Swire’s book _Diary of an MP’s wife: Inside and Outside Power_ is to be published on Thursday amid what will certainly be frantic index searching from everyone who was anyone in Tory circles over the past two decades. \[_This phenomenon is known as the ‘Washington read’, and has been mentioned several times in_ The Indexer_. See, for example, [https://www.theindexer.org/files/24-2/24-2\_061.pdf](https://www.theindexer.org/files/24-2/24-2_061.pdf)._\]

There have been blockbuster works from reporters, family tell-alls and there is a whole industry of pro-Trump books from conservative authors.

But this round-up focuses on works by those who worked with Trump either during the campaign or in the White House.

It is a long cast list: …

James Comey, the former FBI director controversially fired by Trump. He is not a fan of Trump, who in return calls Comey a ‘sleazebag’. His work has the unusual index entry ‘Trump, Donald J. Attempted hug by’.

**Penguin Random House**: _Cook, eat, repeat_: _ingredients, recipes and stories_, by Nigella Lawson (2020, 352 pp, £26). Rev. by Latika Bourke, _Sydney Morning Herald_, 14 November 2020.

… the index of _Cook, Eat, Repeat_ is punctuated with colour codes indicating which dishes can be adapted to be vegetarian, vegan, dairy free and gluten free. It seems the queen of indulgence is feeling some pressure to keep up with modern dietary trends founded on restraint.

## Complete calamity

And now there’s a new edition and guess what? The index is a complete calamity. If you’re looking for City Chicken, you’re not going to find it under C. It’s under Drumsticks, Mock. Irma Rombauer (played by Frances Sternhagen) in _Julie and Julia_ (film directed by Nora Ephron, 2009).

\[_The book in question is Rombauer’s_ The joy of cooking_, published in 1931. Sue Bosanko, who contributed this item, says, ‘Nothing to do with the quote, but out of interest I hunted the recipe down on the Web, mainly because it sounded a bit strange. It turns out to be a mixture of pork and veal pressed together, moulded into shape and breadcrumbed to look like chicken drumsticks. We are talking the 1930s, of course.’_\]
