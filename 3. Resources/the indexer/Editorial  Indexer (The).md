Volume 40, Number 3

There has been a bumper crop of virtual indexing conferences over the past two months. The American Society for Indexing (ASI) kicked things off at the end of April, quickly followed by the Indexing Society of Canada/Société canadienne d’indexation (ISC/SCI) and the Association of Southern African Indexers and Bibliographers (ASAIB) in May. I was fortunate to attend all of them – or at least the sessions that I could tune into from Australia, given the difference in time zones. These virtual conferences are increasingly attracting indexers from around the globe, and I am probably not the only one who enjoys having access to session recordings after the fact so I can catch up on what I missed while asleep!

In this issue, we bring you reports on two of those conferences, and we will fill in the gaps in the next issue. A special thank you to Madelon Nanninga from the Nederlands Indexers Netwerk (NIN) for kindly sharing her experiences of attending the ASAIB conference from the Netherlands. If you have not yet attended a virtual conference outside your member society or geographical area, Madelon’s article might inspire you to try it out.

Continuing our conference theme is Paula Clarke Bain’s reflection on her adventures presenting with Dennis Duncan about his latest book, _Index, a history of the_ (2021), and her index to it. The attention that this book has received is well deserved and has catapulted indexes and indexers into the limelight. Kudos to Paula for not only creating a delightful index but also for stepping up to the virtual podium to talk (and write) about it. As Paula notes, taking on this job was risky, and presenting about it to her colleagues even more exposing. She has handled this with aplomb, and I hope you enjoy reading her entertaining narrative about the experience.

As Ann Kingdom and I report in our article on the ASI conference, there are many ways that indexers might use their skills beyond the creation of back-of-book indexes. While, at first glance, book indexers might wonder how Philip Hider and Leonie Bourke’s discussion of the term ‘pulp’ as a fiction descriptor in library cataloguing applies to them, it is perhaps another example of where our universal indexing skills are valuable. The ability to understand concepts and think about how users will approach them in a particular context is important in the creation and use of controlled vocabularies applied to entire documents as well in the smaller environment of a specific text. Book indexers who also work in the library sector (or got their start there) may be familiar with these overlaps. The ASAIB conference also ranged beyond the book index with its focus on the reader rather than the practice of indexing. It is yet another reason to expand your horizons and take advantage of the opportunity to attend virtual conferences and presentations that are outside your comfort zone.

Joshua Tallent ended his ASI conference presentation by urging the audience ‘to boldly go where no indexer has gone before’. I appreciate Joshua’s encouragement, but I also think that indexers may have always been able and willing to do this. For example, Hazel Bell’s reflections on the content in _The Indexer_ 40 years ago highlight how willing indexers were to discuss new technology, which at that time was the use of computers. Dennis Duncan notes in his book that the index has had a ‘curious path’ as it evolved and responded to shifts in reading systems and readers’ requirements. But perhaps we should say that it was not the index that shifted, it was the indexer. Indexes are still being used, so I would say we have managed to keep pace with the times. That bodes well for the future.
