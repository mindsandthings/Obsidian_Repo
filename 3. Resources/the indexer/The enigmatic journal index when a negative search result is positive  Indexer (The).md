## Abstract

Journal editors’ use of cumulative journal indexes is quite different to that of the traditional readership. Journal editors use such indexes as either a source of inspiration or a tool for verifying if and when a topic has (or has not) been covered in their journal. In many cases, finding few or no search results is a positive outcome, as this provides editors with the scope and impetus to commission articles on topics that have either not been covered in their journal for several years or not covered at all. Three examples are provided.

An index in which the reader cannot find what they need is deemed a failure. Yet, in journal indexing, a lack of success in finding a required topic may be precisely the outcome certain users desire. Journal editors are tasked with pulling together a range of articles for an individual issue but comprise an audience that is overlooked or not even considered when it comes to using a journal index. A search of the index to _The Indexer_ confirmed this view. [Burns (1972)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.27#core-R1) had considered the editor as an audience, but only from the perspective of compiling a journal index for them and not how they might use it.

For professional and semi-professional journals, most articles are contributed by external authors. Other articles may be commissioned by the editor, whereby a knowledgeable author is requested to write an article on a designated topic. The editor will usually write an editorial. Conversely, for popular journals and magazines, the editor/editorial team either commissions the articles/items or has them created by a team of writers within the publishing house.

Thus it is reasonable to ask how editors develop a list of topics for articles they wish to commission.

For cutting-edge topics, there is only likely to be a small cohort of knowledgeable authors who could be approached to write on such fields, so the editor will go directly to those experts.

For topics considered to be neglected, out of fashion or on the periphery of a journal’s focus, but still of relevance to its readership, a search of the journal’s cumulative index would quickly ascertain if and when a particular topic had been written about previously. In many cases, a negative result would be the perfect outcome for the editor. As a case in point, the editor of the semi-professional journal _Chemistry in Australia_ searched the 2003–15 cumulative subject index in precisely this manner to confirm that certain topics had not been covered by the journal.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.27#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> To give an example, on one occasion, her search of the index for musical instruments found nothing, so she commissioned the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits to write an article on X-ray analysis of historical musical instruments for publication in a later issue. With the audience’s interest in old musical instruments and metallurgy, the article proved a winner.

If a search of a cumulative index reveals that a topic has not been written about for several years, editors can use this information to their advantage by commissioning an article or asking an in-house team member to write on the topic. This was exactly the process used by the editorial team at _Australian Good Taste_ – a monthly Woolworths supermarket magazine available free at the check-out counter.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.27#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> Each issue of the magazine included 40 to 50 recipes, and a six-year cumulative index from 1996 to 2001 covered more than 3,200 recipes. The editors wanted to know when they last included a recipe for a particular food or dish – crème caramel flan, for example. After discovering that they had not included the recipe for five years, they knew they could confidently include the same or an updated version of the recipe in a future issue of the magazine. For Woolworths, enhancing the index with subsequent updates proved invaluable to the magazine’s editorial team until the publication ceased in 2013.

Another option available to the editor is reading the index from A to Z looking for topics that have not been written about recently and which should be updated or reinvestigated. This is quite distinct from using a search engine to find a known topic, as the topic itself is essentially unknown at this stage. The index terms themselves provide the stimulus to suggest a topic for a future article. This is the primary purpose of the extensive index to the online _TERN News_ (2011 onwards), as used by the management/editorial team at the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network based at the University of Queensland. TERN is an Australia-wide infrastructure research organization, commonly referred to as Australia’s Land Ecosystem Observatory. TERN monitors ecosystem attributes such as land, terrain, soil, vegetation and wildlife using techniques such as satellite remote sensing and ground-based methods.

To illustrate the index’s purpose, an article covering pollen monitoring and its mapping for early health warnings (think pollen asthma) was published in _TERN News_ in June 2015. Reading through the index and seeing the pollen monitoring entry prompted the editorial team to publish a follow-up article on the topic, which appeared in October 2019 (_TERN News_, [2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.27#core-R3)).

Although the online _TERN News_ index could be used as a search tool in the traditional manner, such use is a secondary consideration and not its major focus.

For journal editors, keeping track of a topic’s publication frequency while planning for future issues can be challenging. Using a cumulative journal index either as a source of inspiration or as a tool for verifying if and when a topic has (or has not) been covered can be invaluable. In this regard, journal indexes serve two distinct audiences. So, although journal indexers may see any failing of their index as a negative, for a journal editor such an outcome may be precisely the result they seek.
