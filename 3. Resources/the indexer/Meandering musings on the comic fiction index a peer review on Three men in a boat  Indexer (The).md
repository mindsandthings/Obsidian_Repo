## Abstract

The Society of Indexers recently ran a peer review exercise, via their online forum SIdeline, on indexing a section from the comic novel _Three men in a boat_ by Jerome K. Jerome. The exercise was run by Melanie Gee and involved a group of indexers indexing the same text, looking at all the combined indexes, and discussing their thoughts on the process. Paula Clarke Bain reports on the insights and wisdom shared during these discussions, and considers the role and purpose of indexes in more unusual texts like novels and comic fiction.

## Introduction

Peer reviews can be an excellent experience for seeing how other indexers approach the same text and for thinking about your own indexing practice, as summarized by Melanie [Gee (2021)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R10). I have attended previous in-person peer review sessions at Society of Indexers (SI) conferences in the UK and enjoyed them immensely. Melanie has detailed recent SI efforts to run such sessions online both on a discussion forum basis and over videoconferencing. As she says, the latest SI one has been on an extract of _Three men in a boat_ by Jerome K. Jerome. The exercise was set up by Melanie and the SI Yorkshire group but opened up to any SI member who wished to join in. I was glad to see this text chosen, as it was good to have something light and comedic to give us all a mental break from recent stressful times.

Melanie had announced the peer review plan on SI’s SIdeline forum and she also kindly emailed me to see if I would like to be involved, as she knew that comedy indexes and fictional indexes are rather becoming my ‘thing’. (See [Bain, 2017](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R1), [2018](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R2); and my indexing blog of comedy book index reviews.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> ) I was more than happy to take part. I also already owned an edition of the book with an index, so I thought this should be useful in the discussion phase. It would, moreover, be a new challenge for everyone, as so few of us ever get to index works of fiction. I did get to do an index/concordance for a book of microfiction short stories last year, but that is literally another story for another time. As for the question of whether fiction should be indexed at all – well, we shall see.

The short comic novel _Three men in a boat (to say nothing of the dog)_ was originally published in 1889, without an index. The indexed copy is the edition published by Pavilion Books in 1982, annotated and introduced by Christopher Matthew and Benny Green, with an index by Anthony Raven (uncredited in the book). The novel follows a journey of three men – the narrator J. and his friends George and Harris – and one dog (Montmorency) on a rowing boat trip up the river Thames, and features J.’s various musings throughout. Jerome said that he set out to write ‘The Story of the Thames’ but with some ‘humorous relief’: ‘I decided to write the “humorous relief” first, get it off my chest, so to speak. After which, in sober frame of mind, I could tackle the scenery and history. I never got there’ ([Jerome, 1982](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R12): 9).

## How it worked: background and method

Melanie gauged potential interest in the peer review exercise via an initial SIdeline post and ran the vote on the type of text preferred. Once several people had responded, she posted to confirm that the text would be _Three men in a boat_ and gave a link to a free PDF copy that we could download so that we would all be working from the same version of the text.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> There were no actual page numbers on the document so we worked to the PDF page number box. We were given instructions to index Chapters 6 to 8, which covered PDF pages 45 to 75, so a 30-page section of about 11,500 words. This covers the start of the river journey, as the characters go nowhere for the first five chapters. We were given a date to send our index efforts to Melanie, who would then combine them and circulate all the indexes to all the participants.

The relative advantages and drawbacks of anonymity have been discussed by Melanie ([Gee, 2021](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R10): 240), but she decided for this peer review that participant indexes would be anonymized by pseudonyms so that only she had the full overview of whose index was whose. This time, she had the fine idea of anonymizing us to river-related _noms de plume_, with a ‘something nautical’ forename and a ‘something natural to do with watery habitats’ surname if possible. Participants could suggest their own pseudonyms, or Melanie would assign an appropriate name. I chose the name Coracle Coot – a ‘coracle’ being a small round boat traditionally used in Wales (I am half Welsh myself), and ‘coot’ as it was the closest alliterative duck-like creature I could think of, and I do like ducks. That’s my cover also blown, then.

I duly indexed the three chapters, edited my short index to a good (enough) standard, and emailed it to Melanie with my preferred pseudonym. I review more on the indexing process in the discussion section (below), but suffice to say here that I can confirm Melanie’s comments about it being very different to try to focus a whole index on such a short part of the text, as that is not what we normally do.

Melanie launched the discussion thread on SIdeline, while she was still collecting the last few indexes, with a post that invited participants to share ‘who we are, where we’re from, where our nearest river is and what it’s like’, plus any memorable tales or dreams of boating adventures. Our nearest rivers included the Darent, Foss, Frome, Mersey, Sheaf and Thames itself in England, and the Dee and Water of Leith in Scotland. This was a good icebreaker exercise for us to introduce ourselves before we got down to the indexing business.

A few days later, Melanie emailed the combined-indexes document: one document containing all 15 submitted indexes from 14 indexers (as we shall see, somebody did two), laid out in order of pseudonym. These other names included such delights as ‘Babbling Backwater’, ‘Barnacle Bilge Pump’, ‘Duck Dastardly’, ‘Otter Mizzen’, and ‘Up the Thames Without a Paddle’. The full list of pseudonyms, with the abbreviated codes I am using in this review, is given in the notes.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup>

The combined index document was 31 pages long, and all individual indexes were between one and three pages in length in double-column format; most were two pages. We were free to choose the length, style and indeed tone of our indexes.

My first impressions of the indexes on the whole were as usual for a peer review exercise: some things common to all (particularly regarding names of places and persons), but also a huge amount of variation, as detailed below.

## Discussion

We were then into discussion mode. Melanie posted a first prompt to say she would be introducing further topics in due course. The first general point we were asked to consider was: ‘What purposes do indexes to fiction, and to comedy (and the crossover between the two, as in this case), serve?’ We were also asked to pick three examples of entries from others’ indexes that we particularly liked. Let us start with the general overview of indexes to fiction first, then comic indexes, and then consider some of the gems in this one to start focusing in on our _Boat_ indexes.

### _Indexes in fiction_

Our peer review group posted many interesting thoughts on the purpose of indexes in fiction. It was said that an index to fiction could be helpful to refer back to points once a novel had been read, rather than as a tool to study first. The index can be used to check details and look things up for clarification, particularly handy in a long and complicated novel, or series of novels, with lots of characters – examples given here included Dickens and Tolkien and Tolstoy’s _War and peace._ For such works, an index could help the reader keep track of events and trace themes and relationships. The danger of the index presenting ‘spoilers’ was also raised; it could give away key elements of the plot if you use the index before finishing the book, and perhaps the introductory note to the index should also function partly as a ‘spoiler alert’ here.

It was noted that we were in the realm of the ‘soft’, narrative texts discussed by Hazel K. Bell in _Indexing biographies and other stories of human lives_ (2020: 1–2), and that our indexing practice needed to be more flexible accordingly. (More on this below.) An index can be said to ‘entertain and delight’ in its own right, with intriguing entries that draw you in to the text, which leads on to our related consideration of indexes in comedy works.

### _Comedic indexes_

As regards the purpose of the index in comedy books, we noted that there could be much more freedom and leeway allowed the indexer. The index can provide the opportunity to add additional jokes and an extra layer of humour to the text. The conventions and syntax of index entries can also be ripe for parody.

It can be a tricky line to tread, though, to try to make an index both useful and funny; in fact, Melanie said she thought she had ‘failed’ at this and so ended up doing two indexes, one fairly sensible and one for amusement value. It was great to have Ann Kingdom’s input here as one of the peer review participants, as she was able to share her insights about the index she did to Clive James’s first comic novel _Brilliant creatures_ (1983), an amazing commission. She said that she treated the book ‘as if it was non-fiction’ and ‘then left Clive to titivate it and make some of the headings more humorous’.

Some examples of comedic indexes were given, including Jack Dee’s autobiography (which has one index entry: ‘Dee, Jack 1–393’), _Me Cheeta_ (the ‘autobiography of Tarzan’s chimpanzee companion’ by James Lever) and _The meaning of liff_ (by Douglas Adams and John Lloyd). I mentioned my comedy index blog in this respect, where I have so far looked at the comedy book indexes of ‘Alan Partridge’, ‘Steven Toast’, Richard Ayoade, Francis Wheen and Charlie Brooker.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup> More to come there in future.

It can be a fun thing to do to add funny index entries, if the book’s tone allows for it, but generally best to check this with the author or editor to make them aware. I have recently done two indexes for a comedy historian, and there is always scope for a few comedic, not to mention rude and sweary, entries in his books, with his knowledge and permission. I would say it is the kind of book, and readership, that can take them.

So it is entertaining to be creating a comedic and fictional index, but is there any real point to it? Or does there even need to be? This has been considered before.

### _Writings and debates on fictional indexes_

Between us, we had already started to touch on much ground that has been discussed in previous indexing literature. As mentioned, [Bell (2020)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R7) discusses the indexing of ‘soft’ texts and reviews the arguments for and against indexes for fiction. Our arguments on the purpose of fiction indexes tie in very much with this, with Bell also highlighting the contrary view of many people that fiction should not be indexed at all.

Hazel Bell’s list of indexes to fiction (2007) covers books from Thomas Malory’s _Morte d’Arthur_ in 1485 (indexed edition in 2000) to Philip Allot’s _Invisible power_ in 2005. In this, she covers books that were originally printed with an index as well as those that had indexes supplied to later editions, for a total of 73 works up to the year 2005. (There have been several more since.) Of particular relevance here, she mentions the index to _Brilliant creatures_ by Clive [James (1983)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R11), with its ‘full, working 15-page index’ (by Ann Kingdom) – ‘Characters and their adventures are analysed in the index in loving detail’ ([Bell, 2007](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R6): 173). She also includes the 1982 edition of _Three men in a boat_ with the index by Anthony Raven.

Index scholar and indexers’ friend Dennis [Duncan (2014)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R9) has also investigated the role of indexes in fiction, with particular reference to Samuel Richardson’s _Clarissa_, Virginia Woolf’s _Orlando_, Vladimir Nabokov’s _Pale fire_ and J. G. Ballard’s ‘The Index’. He notes the arguments for and against such indexes, making the case that an index can be a book part to be read and enjoyed in itself. To quote William S. Heckscher (admittedly also an indexer):

> I prefer the Index which has a life of its own, which may pride itself on being the child of imagination, and which should enable us to spend a peaceful evening in bed, reading such an Index, as if we were reading a good novel. (Quoted in [Duncan, 2014](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R9): 9–10)

To row back a few years, a major contribution to the debate was made in _The Indexer_ by Philip [Bradley (1989)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R8), who sought the opinions of authors, reviewers, readers and publishers as to the need for indexes to fiction. In the ‘for’ camp, indexes were noted for making a book accessible and as a short cut to information, whatever the type of book, as well for being ‘a work of art’, using the same Heckscher quote as above. Bernard Levin is quoted as saying, ‘I have always been in favour of this move \[i.e. indexing fiction\] and am amazed that nobody has ever taken it up’ (in [Bradley, 1989](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R8): 241). Types of novels that were said potentially to benefit from an index include classics with a large number of characters (Dickens and Tolstoy again, as well as Eliot, Hardy, Thackeray and the like); novels with a large ‘cult’ readership (Tolkien again); and novels with a ‘serious and detailed historical framework’.

The ‘against’ arguments focused partly around ‘the spectre of cost’, which the publishers would not risk increasing if there was not enough reader demand. There was also some thinking that an index to fiction could be ‘unwanted’, ‘unnecessary’ and indeed ‘positively detrimental to the aims of fiction’. One of the authors discussed in this consultation was Jeanette Winterson, whose views were made clear: ‘I think that indexing fiction would be a terrible idea … No. We need what magic remains in this little life. Let’s not nail it down only to find it has disappeared’ (quoted in [Bradley, 1989](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R8): 241). On the subject of reader demand, there were many quotes from readers who did not see the point of indexes in fiction. Some indexers too had aired their reservations, with one declaring, ‘Who wants to retrieve _information_ from a novel?’ ([Bradley, 1989](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R8): 243).

Bradley also mentions Bell’s 1983 book review of Clive James’s _Brilliant creatures_ and its 15-page index (then without indexer attribution, but now known to be by Ann Kingdom). Bell’s review notes that the merits of such indexes related less to information retrieval, but that ‘indexing all such fiction would provide indexes that were enjoyable to read, more work for proliferating indexers, and more fun in our labours’. She says that the index works for finding incidents and is fun and detailed; ‘This full, working index to a new novel may be seen as a genuine landmark in publishing history’ ([Bell, 1983](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R5): 277).

In conclusion, though, Bradley states that the general feeling, especially among authors, was that ‘novels are not the sort of books that need to be indexed’ – ‘They do not contain factual information in the way that non-fiction works do’ ([Bradley, 1989](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R8): 248).

### _Back to the boat_

In response to Bradley’s article, the next issue of _The Indexer_ contained a letter to the editor from indexer Anthony [Raven (1990)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R13). In it, Raven says that some of the beliefs about the detrimental effects of a fiction index seemed to him to be based on a misunderstanding of the nature of fiction and the reader’s need for factual information in both fictional and non-fictional works. He states, ‘within the context of a book, which is all an index is concerned with, the one kind of fact is every bit as factual, and as indexable, as the other’ ([Raven, 1990](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R13): 60). Raven argues that Winterson seems to ‘miss the point’ with her comment about needing ‘what magic remains in this little life’, as the reader is quite welcome to ignore the index while having their magical experience of reading the novel. The index will just still be there for referring back or rereading parts afterwards. He regards the need for indexed editions of Hardy, Trollope and Dickens, among similar others, as ‘self-evident’.

As an example, Raven mentions his index to – yes – _Three men in a boat_ ([Jerome, 1982)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R12). We have finally rowed back round in a circle. He says that no doubt the annotations to the edition were an additional reason for the publishers to include an index, while noting that this ‘masterpiece of escapist literature’ is actually also full of references to ‘real’ people and places. Raven states that his index distinguishes between references to the annotations and references to the original text by having the note number in parentheses: e.g. ‘Bank Holidays, 24(1)’ refers to information in note 1 on page 24. It does not, however, distinguish between ‘real’ facts – such as historical events mentioned – and ‘imaginary facts’ – such as incidents experienced by the characters, like their joint failure to open a tin of pineapple: ‘In the context of the book, Magna Carta and the tin-opener are equally factual and equally worthy of being indexed’ ([Raven, 1990](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R13): 61). Raven wonders whether publishers’ reluctance to include indexes to classic novels might not only be influenced by the cost factor but also by this ‘mistaken idea as to the nature of facts in fiction’. In the eyes of [Raven (1990](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R13): 60), ‘all facts are equally factual’ within the context of a book, because ‘book indexes index books, not real life’.

### _The published index_

So here we are, back where we started. As mentioned, many bends in the river ago, I already owned a copy of the indexed edition, so this was going to aid the peer review discussion, although I did try to put the published index out of my mind while composing my own effort. (Honest.)

The published index has a short introductory note: ‘Numbers in brackets following page references are annotation numbers’. The book contains many photographs, illustrations and maps of the river Thames, but these are not distinguished typographically. The main book text is laid out in two columns. When there are notes on the page, the notes are in the outer column; otherwise it is two columns of the original text. The index is four pages long, in four columns, for a large-format book (about 20 × 27 centimetres per page) of 188 pages. The subheading format style is run on with semicolon separators, rather than indented/set-out style. This would become a key point of debate as our discussions continued.

### _Our favourite gems_

Alongside the discussion of the purpose of indexes in fiction, we had also been encouraged by Melanie to share some favourite entries from our combined indexes:

> There are some real gems of entries amongst our indexes. Please share three that particularly appealed to you – because they’re clever, funny, pithy, or perhaps capture very well something that you struggled to index – anything that floats your boat.

This was a fun way to get us all thinking about the indexes and what we liked about how others had approached the text. Some general comments were ‘what a brilliant and entertaining set of indexes (and very imaginative pseudonyms too)’, ‘the indexes and pseudonyms are all great fun’, ‘a great set of indexes there’ and ‘a rewarding set of indexes to browse through’.

Some of the individual highlights chosen in our top three picks are shown in [Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#F1). (Codes in square brackets refer to the index writer’s pseudonym.) As I think we all found it hard to choose just three gems, [Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#F2) shows a few more that I particularly liked, with one example from each index submitted.

What a fine effort all round.

### _Breaking rules_

While the last few gems were still being submitted, Melanie introduced the next topic for discussion:

> Did you explicitly consider rule breaking, and if so, which rules did you break? Were there any other devices that you used for comic effect? Or have you seen other devices used in comedy indexes?

Many of us appreciated the opportunity of having no hard and fast rules, and to break a few of the usual ones. Melanie said that she set out to break ‘nearly every indexing “rule” going’ in her comical index, and likened her method to ‘an attempted freestyle jazz solo’, but feared that the result may have been ‘a cacophonous racket’.

Between us, there was a selection of the following broken rules:

•

conciseness, or lack of (language that was antiquated, elongated, fantastical, florid, flowery and lengthier than usual, reflecting the comic and digressive style of Jerome)

•

more passing mentions included (as no particular reason to leave them out)

•

non-indexable concepts indexed, just because they appealed

•

circular cross-references employed

•

lack of disambiguation for ambiguous terms/homonyms, such as ‘banks’ and ‘drawers’

•

a general playing with indexing syntax and conventions.

Everyone did produce a recognizable index, though, following conventions of alphabetical order, subheading layout, etc. It was noted here that there was an opportunity for some silliness regarding the Hampton Court maze section, of an entry being lost somewhere, or misfiled in the wrong place. Many of us thought this had great potential, and were frankly kicking ourselves that we did not take the chance. (The old ‘Oh, I could have done _that_’ syndrome, shortly after sending off an index.)

Most tended to restrict their comedy to the choice of wording in their subheadings or heading qualifying text, so we did not all go overboard (ha). In the midst of this discussion, we digressed (as frequently happens in such a session) into a consideration of problematic language.

### _Problematic language_

It could not go unremarked that the ‘N-word’ appears once in the novel, within the chapters we indexed. It pulled us up short and did not appear in any of our indexes. One index did have an entry for ‘Margate minstrels’, which is what the allusion was about. The published index in 1982 includes the N-word in full in the index, as an (uncensored) index entry of ‘n–r minstrels’, with an explanatory note in the main-text margins. The book was originally published in 1889 and this was the historic terminology for these ‘blackface’ entertainer troupes. The times and language have changed, and the indexer must remain aware of and sensitive to such issues. Melanie added a supplementary question here:

> Has anyone been faced with really problematic language in an indexing job, and if so, how did you deal with it?

There were several reports here of swear words in texts that we have sometimes also included in the indexes, which was generally agreed to be fair game – the index is, after all, only reflecting the terminology and tone of the book – although the point was made that perhaps such language seems less acceptable in the index than it is in the text. There had been some checking with authors or editors over acceptable language and preferred terms for particular practices or groups of people, such as ‘travellers’ and potential alternatives. Nobody reported having been really offended or upset by anything they had worked on, which was good, but that is not to say that it had not happened.

We now digressed again, while a few people caught up, onto the topic of indexing software.

### _Software_

After one member raised the topic of indexing technologies, Melanie followed up with a question:

> If anyone would like to share what technology they used to index this, now’s your chance!

Our group members reported using the following software to complete the indexes: CINDEX, MACREX, SKY Index, IndexExploit and Word. This seemed like a good spread for a group of 14. Some students had not yet invested in dedicated indexing software. One indexer took the opportunity to do the index on a free download of a different indexing software program to the one they already owned. Ann Kingdom told us about past working methods, writing entries on index cards and then typing up the index. Appreciation was expressed for current technologies for both indexing and checking queries on the Internet. Barry Campbell advised that he had exported the PDF text to Word to do as an embedded index, also saying that his IndexExploit program could take any of our indexes and link them by page number to the PDF on the Internet. I have yet to test this out but I will do.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup>

### _Characters_

By this time, we were ready for another question, namely how we treated the book’s main and supporting characters in our indexes.

#### _Main character_

This was the most challenging index entry, and some did not include one. Melanie’s prompts were:

> For those who didn’t have a main heading for J at all, why not, and do you think your approach was successful?
> 
> For those who did, what did you decide to index under your entry for him (assuming there was any method to it at all)?

The first problem we hit was what to call the narrator figure. We saw a variety of answers to this, such as ‘J.’ (the most popular option), ‘Jerome’, ‘Jerome, Jerome K.’, ‘myself’ and ‘narrator’, as he was not named in the chapters we indexed. (He is occasionally referred to as ‘J.’ elsewhere.) The published index uses ‘J.’, with cross-references to and from ‘Jerome, Jerome Klapka’. We did not dwell on this, as in a real job you would just check it with the author or editor.

If we _did_ include an entry for him, how much or little would be indexed there? Here we had some good discussions relating to both the concept of the ‘metatopic’ and (auto)biography indexing. Do Mi Stauber’s book _Facing the text_ was acknowledged as a great help when considering how to treat the metatopic and surrounding index structure. The term ‘metatopic’ was applied to the concept of ‘the main topic of the whole book’ by Do Mi Stauber in 1997 ‘to fill an apparent gap in indexing terminology’: ‘The **metatopic** is the structural center of the index: every single heading you create will be implicitly related to it’ ([Stauber, 2004](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R14): 9). There are differing views as to how to treat the metatopic, from not including one (as everything is elsewhere), to giving it a huge entry (with a risk of becoming an ‘index within an index’), and everything in between. In practice, an indexer has to figure out the best solution for each individual book. Fun!

In our _Boat_ example, everything is narrated by J. – the river journey, his (frequent) digressions, and what his friends are saying and doing both now and in the past. This means that approaching the text has similarities to indexing an autobiography or memoirs. What do you do with the main figure? Again, several of us mentioned Bell’s _Indexing biographies_ (2020), which offers many excellent examples of how the main figure entry may be structured to fit the needs of the text and reader. The Bradley article is of further relevance: ‘Novels frequently contain an element of autobiography and, apart from biography and history, novels are one of the few types of literature which deal with people as opposed to things, either factually or imaginatively’ ([Bradley, 1989](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R8): 244). This can make them all the more fascinating, but accordingly all the more tricky to index. Most of our indexes did have an entry for the J. figure. The main problem we had is that, in large parts of this book, nothing much is actually _happening_, other than J. recollecting various things. In the group discussion, participants variously referred to this as ‘reminiscences’, ‘flights of fancy’, ‘daydreaming’, ‘reverie’, ‘wandering off-topic’, ‘going off on one’, ‘waxing lyrical’, and the very lovely and apt ‘meandering musings’, as in this article’s title. (Credit and thank you to Julia Smith for that one.)

Because of this, many of the indexers had at least tried to distinguish things that J. was doing from things that J. was pondering, with appropriate subheadings, and sometimes sub-subheadings. Examples included ‘daydreams about’, ‘observations and musings’, ‘opinions of’, ‘views on’ or just the use of ‘on \[this and that\]’ to distinguish his views from his (limited) actions. The published index by Raven does much the same, using wording such as ‘advocates’, ‘his views on’, ‘muses on’, ‘recollects’, ‘reflects on’ and ‘regrets’.

Most participants did agree that there should be some kind of entry for J. The general sense was that the book is about _three_ men in a boat, and it would therefore be weird to make index entries for just two of them. So what about those supporting characters?

#### _Supporting characters_

Our other two boatmen, George and Harris, presented far fewer problems. Where they appear, they are for the most part ‘doing’ things – attempting to sing comic songs, falling in a hamper, getting lost in a maze, playing the banjo, visiting tombs, wearing terrible clothes – and on the short section of text we had, the structure of these entries did not take much work.

As regards their names, most just used ‘George’ and ‘Harris’ as that is all we had in this text section – although the full name of William Samuel Harris is given earlier in the book so some used that. In the published index, there are cross-references to and from ‘Hentschel, Carl’ (for Harris) and ‘Wingrave, George’, the real friends of Jerome that they were based on.

And _‘(to say nothing of the dog)’_, as in the book’s full title? Some indexers indeed said nothing and left him out of their index. (A soft whimper from off set.) Apparently Montmorency, the small fox terrier, was not based on a real dog, which also made some of us quite sad. He only appears twice in the section we indexed, but still rather pleasing to include. I went for:

Montmorency: barks at George in Weybridge 75; somersaults at sculling mishap 50

I did not put a qualifier of ‘(dog)’. I figured a reader could work it out.

### _Subheadings_

As seen above, I chose to use run-on subheadings, partly for a contrast as I suspected most would not. In fact, I was the only one who did. Melanie offered another question:

> Did anyone consider and reject using run-on subheading style? Do you agree that run-on might be better for works of fiction or biographies?

The style of subheadings became quite a talking point, with many comments to the effect that set-out subheadings were more reader-friendly and easier to use, and that run-on subheadings were just a ‘space-saving economy’. It was, however, noted that run-on subheadings can work better for more narrative texts such as biographies and fictional works. The published index by Raven is in run-on style, which is not the easiest for finding specific points, but I think it works in its meandering way, reflecting the wayward journey itself, and is pleasurable to read in my eyes. Of course, run-on subheading style can also save a huge amount of space too if you are working to a tight set length of index. Biography indexes were again raised here, with some saying that they find biography indexes with long, run-on, page-number-order entries annoying and ‘impenetrable’. This method can seem too much like ‘rewriting the book in the index’. Further discussions again referred to Bell’s (2020) advice on structuring biography indexes, noting that themed set-out subheadings, followed by run-on sub-subheadings, can both save space and guide the reader.

### _Names_

#### _Personal names_

Before there was a falling out over subheadings, Melanie came to the rescue with our next question:

> Did you need to do some detective work (Googling) to figure out how to index any of the people mentioned? How did you index anyone who isn’t given a name?

Our indexers talked about looking up some of the historical names – mainly the likes of Cassivelaunus, Edwy, Elgiva and Odo. Several said that you would usually check more if it was a proper paid job, but there was less pressure to get it right in this case.

Names are sometimes thought of as the easy side of indexing, but there can be many pitfalls and variations. It was here that some of main differences between our indexes could be spotted.

Julius Caesar could be found filed under ‘Caesar’, ‘Caesar, Julius’ and ‘Julius Caesar’ – and, in the published version, none of these but somewhat hidden away as a subheading under ‘Romans’.

Some people filed the Duchess of York as ‘York, Duchess of’, some as ‘Duchess of York’, and others went further with their research to include the correct historical figure of ‘Frederica Charlotte of Prussia (Duchess of York and Albany)’. She is the one who had the dogs’ cemetery at Oatlands Park, as mentioned by J. (You can still see some of the headstones at the Oatlands Park Hotel, whose website states they are ‘now set in the hotel lawn near the lounge bar patio’).

The character name of ‘Herr Slossenn Boschen’ could be found filed under B, H, and S in our indexes. J.’s Uncle Podger was found under both U and P. Some indexing guidance advises that stage and character names may be better filed as they are and are not inverted, so there are arguments in support of each.

Mrs Thomas’s tomb was indexed as ‘Mrs Thomas’s tomb’ (when considered as a whole place name), ‘Thomas, Mrs Susannah, tomb of’, and ‘tomb: of Mrs Thomas’. (This is a real tomb at Hampton Church in England.)

There was also a character referred to as Bow, with some disagreement about whether that was a nickname related to his position in the boat, or his actual surname. I thought the former, but I am not sure, and it hardly matters – he would be indexed as ‘Bow’ either way. The place name of Bow also appeared in the text, which did not help.

Some characters with no names appeared in our indexes, in particular an aged figure encountered by J. in a churchyard, whom we variously described as ‘bald-headed man’, ‘miserable old man, jingling keys’, ‘old bald-headed man’, ‘sexton, elderly’ and ‘tombs, old man who loves’.

Often, then, the same information was in our indexes, but not in the same place. Names are not that easy.

#### _Place names_

We seemed to be on safer ground with place names. Most of our indexes looked pretty similar from that comparison, covering places such as Corway Stakes, Hampton Court maze, Kempton Park, Oatlands Park, Reading, Shepperton and Windsor. There was some judgement exercised about which of these were left out as ‘passing mentions’. Indexers will not always agree over this.

Kingston itself, the starting point of the trip, was, however, treated in a number of ways: as Kingston, Kingston upon Thames, Kingston-upon-Thames, Kyningestun and Royal Borough of Kingston.

By this time, a few weeks in, the forum discussion was slowing down, as people moved on to other things and new indexes pushed this one out of the mind. A few other points still came up though.

### _Trips and travels_

Melanie asked if anyone considered indexing the boat trip itself. Most had not, or had included this information under headings such as ‘Thames, river’, but some could see how this might be helpful for a reader to be able to follow the journey. This led on to a diversion about travel books and their indexes, as this novel seemed to sit ‘on the borderlines of fiction and travel writing’. We were told (by Liz Cook) that _The old ways_ by Robert Macfarlane has a categorized index (by Dave Cradduck) in multiple sequences, such as ‘birds’, ‘islands’ and ‘mountains & hills’. Many said they were not fans of multiple index sequences, though, as it may take a reader longer to find what they are looking for. It was noted that one major fictional work with multiple index sequences is Tolkien’s _The lord of the rings_, divided into: i songs and verses; ii persons, beasts and monsters; iii places; iv things. Within this discussion, Nicola Green also suggested we take look at the online article _Three men in a boat, on a map_ ([Barlow, 2017](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R3)), which maps the actual river trip from Kingston to Oxford, plus all the other global places mentioned in the descriptive text and anecdotes. This was appreciated as a good read.

### _Readership_

Melanie then posted a question concerning

> indexing decisions we make/have made, and the intended readership

but it seemed that everyone had pretty much floated back off into their normal lives by this stage. It is a key point though, and the SIdeline forum thread is still ‘live’ at the time of writing, so perhaps discussions can be ongoing. This may have circled us round to our embarkation point by considering both new and returning readers, how they might be using the book (for pleasure or study), and thus back to the role and purpose of indexes in fiction.

## General thoughts

I will close off this article by sharing a few of my thoughts about my own index, and then some cons and pros of this overall peer review experience.

### _My index musings_

It was certainly a different experience focusing so closely on such a short section of text. I also felt the difficulty, as others did, of trying to treat this index to a few chapters as if it was a full book index; I agree with Melanie that the ambiguous nature of indexing an extract of a longer text for a peer review exercise can give the indexes ‘a bit of an identity crisis’. It was lovely to have room to play and have fun with it, but I did find it hard trying to reconcile making an index that was both of real use and comical, and eventually had to do this as separate passes. I am not sure that there was even all that much humour in mine; that perhaps takes a different kind of time and thought than we are used to. I was working on another paid index in submission week, as many of us were, and I find it hard to swap thinking about more than one index at a time. Much of the humour (such as it was) in mine was wording taken from the text, such as ‘Harris: sings like an approaching earthquake’. The published index is not all that ‘funny’ in itself either, also mainly quoting the text, so a reader’s enjoyment would depend on how amusing they found the book as a whole. Humour, like indexing, is subjective. I am definitely glad to have joined in with the peer review, because it is in the discussions that the true magic happens.

### _Cons and pros_

I will start with a few cons from this experience, so I can end on a positive with plenty of pros.

#### _Cons_

The main disadvantage to me of a peer review exercise run as an online discussion was the time period. It is easy to lose track of where the discussion is up to if you are not on the forum for a few days, especially in the first early stages. Several of us commented that it is a strange experience trying to recall what you did and why in a past index, especially if you have worked on other indexes since. Indexing is an extremely intense cognitive experience while it is happening, but afterwards many of us agreed that the details seemed to ‘fall right out of my brain’. An in-person peer review is a short, sharp session with the index very fresh in everyone’s minds, and of course it has the sociable benefits too. I also take Melanie’s point that ‘anonymity may hinder discussion if participants are tiptoeing around issues’ ([Gee, 2021](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R10): 240), and there was some of that ‘caginess’ here. There may indeed have been fewer ‘spontaneous topics’ and ‘candid insights’ as a result. The converse side, of course, is that this very anonymity encourages many to take part in the first place, including students, so perhaps in future some could be run without anonymity to see what happens. People may be more or less likely to contribute online than face to face, and some communications may be taken in a better or worse way, but that is not just restricted to online peer reviews; it is something we are all having to learn to deal with more.

#### _Pros_

As for the positives, of course this is a way that we can continue to have the peer review experience even when meeting up is not possible. We are still able to maintain and enhance these connections despite current difficult conditions. It opens up these peer review sessions to being much more generally accessible, whatever the circumstances, as people are not always able to get to in-person sessions for a variety of reasons. There was also no limit on the numbers that could participate. At the time of writing, there had been 93 posts by 19 different people on the SIdeline thread, so a few more than the original 14 who submitted indexes, and the thread can be read by any SI member on the forum. Participants could indeed ‘dip in and out’ of the discussions when it suited them best, and many more could read and ‘chip in’, or just ‘lurk’ along and still gain some benefit. We were afforded more time to study and compare the indexes as compared to a short face-to-face session. The peer review discussions are archived and searchable on the SIdeline forum, which is handy for referring back to key points.

On peer reviews more generally, this one again helped with lessening the isolation of being a freelance indexer. It made me think about the book and my indexing practice in new ways, through looking at others’ examples and comments. It is always interesting to see the different approaches people use and to (re)consider your own practice for the future.

## Conclusion

In summary, then, I believe that this was an enjoyable and worthwhile peer review exercise. _Three men in a boat_ was a different kind of text for all of us. The peer review experience is really nothing to fear, as it is not about criticism of the individual index you submit – it is the combination of them, the discussion you get from everyone, the fact that you have all worked on the same thing and are sharing the thoughts you have had about it. This is where the ‘gold dust’ is for me.

There is no one right way to index a text. There are many ‘wrong’ things you should probably avoid, but lots of scope for individual choice and flair. That is the subjectivity of indexing, and why it is so challenging but also so stimulating. If you fancy trying a peer review, you can always lurk first time and see how it all works, then submit an index next time. Or, better still, just dive straight in.

It was a rewarding experience to be part of this peer review, and lots of fun to do and discuss. As for how ‘useful’ our final indexes were, and whether fiction should have an index at all, I will leave these parting words (from a review of the index in Lucy Ellmann’s _Sweet desserts_): ‘On the whole, the index is more entertainment than use; but so, after all, is a novel’ ([Batchelor, 1989](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.24#core-R4): 194). That might just be reason enough.
