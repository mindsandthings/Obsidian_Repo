Publication: The Indexer: The International Journal of Indexing

Volume 39, Number 3

These extracts from reviews do not pretend to represent a complete survey of all reviews in journals and newspapers. We offer only a selection from quotations that readers have sent in. Our reproduction of comments is not a stamp of approval from _The Indexer_ upon the reviewer’s assessment of an index. Extracts are arranged alphabetically under the names of publishers, within the sections: Indexes praised; Two cheers!; Indexes censured; Indexes omitted.

## Indexes praised

**T. & T. Clark**: _A guide to Christian art_, by Diane Apostolos-Cappadona (2020, xi + 298 pp., £65 (hbk), £19.99 (pbk)). Rev. by Graham Howes, _Theology_ **124**(2).

The entries themselves, if densely formatted and closely written, are very thoroughly indexed and help make the book an indispensable adjunct to understanding Christian art, whether in galleries or places of worship, or simply by reading the text independently.

_**_**A. G. Duff Publishing**_**: Beetles of Britain and Ireland, vol 2: Geotrupidae to Scraptildae_, _by Andrew G. Duff (2020, 670 pp., £109). Rev. by Richard Wright, British Wildlife_, _April 2021._

The reference section is extensive and comprehensive. The book concludes with a very complete index, which usefully includes synonyms.

_**_**Henry Holt & Company**_**: What doesn’t kill you: a life with chronic illness – lessons from a body in revolt_, _by Tessa Miller (2021, 320 pp., £16.78). Rev. by C. J. Hauser, New York Times Review of Books_, _21 March 2021._

Now, in her memoir, she writes explicitly for fellow chronically ill people, with chapters divided by topic, an index for practical use and instructions throughout to advise readers.

**Hutchinson**: _Henry ‘Chips’ Channon: the diaries: 1918–38_, ed. by Simon Heffer (2021, 1024 pp., £35). Rev. by Jane Ridley, _The Oldie_, April 2021.

Simon Heffer has edited this vast text with great skill, never intruding with excessive footnotes, always letting Chips speak for himself and providing an exemplary index.

Rev. by Richard Davenport-Hines, _Times Literary Supplement_, 5 March 2021.

The index to Heffer’s first volume, exceeding fifty pages of small-print triple columns, recalls nothing so much as P. A. Spalding’s _Index-guide to ‘Remembrance of Things Past’._

\[Spalding’s book _(A reader’s handbook to Proust: an index guide to Remembrance of Things Past,_ Chatto & Windus, 1952) is divided into a character index, a thematic index, a general index and a synopsis. See also another extract from Richard Davenport-Hines’s review under ‘By the way’ below.\]

**Unbound**: _Pedro and Ricky come again_, by Jonathan Meades (2021, 983 pp., £30). Rev. by Nick Lezard, _The Spectator_, 17 April 2021.

I should add that this is a very handsomely produced book, insofar as its proofreading and indexing go. That is quite the feat to sustain over nearly 1,000 pages, and the only mistake I found was a single palate/palette confusion, and I cannot imagine how that got in there.

_**_**Valentin Koerner**_**: Konjunktionsprognostik in der frühen Neuzeit, vol 1: Die Antichrist-Prognose des Johannes von Lübeck (1474) zur Saturn-Jupiter-Konjunktion von 1504 und ihre frühneuzeitliche Rezeption_, _by Stephan Heilen (2020, xii + 710 pp., €78). Rev. by H. Darrel Rutkin, Journal for the History of Astronomy **_**52**_**(1)._

The volume ends with a useful summary, followed by a marvelously detailed and up-to-date bibliography of primary and secondary sources (including the computer software he has used!) and an equally detailed index, all of which make the volume more ‘user-friendly’ than it would have otherwise been.

_**_**Oxford University Press**_**: The documentary imagination in twentieth-century French literature: writing with facts_, _by Alison James (2020, 260 pp., £60). Rev. by John Flower, Journal of European Studies **_**51**_**(1)._

The 14-page Index is excellent.

**Oxford University Press**: _Information hunters_, by Kathy Peiss (2020, 277 pp., £22.99). Rev. by Charles Oppenheim, _Journal of Librarianship and Information Science_ (n.d.).

The book is well supported by numerous photographs, an extensive set of references and a good index.

**Unicorn**: _Angela Thirkell: a writer’s life_, by Anne Hall (2021, 160 pp., £17.85). Rev. by Joules Barham, _Northern Reader_ (blog, [https://northernreader.wordpress.com](https://northernreader.wordpress.com/)), 15 March 2021.

The comprehensive index covers an extensive range of people, places and more of the entire book.

**Wayne State University Press**: _101 Middle Eastern tales and their impact on Western oral tradition_, by Ulrich Marzolph (2020, 720 pp., $49.99). Rev. by Geert Jan van Gelder, _Times Literary Supplement_, 12 March 2021.

With a bibliography of some seventy pages and extensive indexes of motifs and names, this is a book of impeccable scholarship and vast learning and at the same time a wonderful treasure trove to dip into at random.

## Indexes censured

**Oxford University Press**: _Heart full of rhythm: the big band years of Louis Armstrong_, by Ricky Riccardi (2020, 336 pp., £26.99). Rev. by Russell Davies, _Times Literary Supplement,_ 26 March 2021.

But in editing terms, the Oxford University Press will not be claiming this as their finest hour. The text needed a lot more checking for typos, omissions and inconsistencies: for example, the three versions offered of the screenwriter Elliot Paul’s name, none of them marked ‘sic’ and none of them appearing in the index, from which in fact many essential names are missing.

_**_**University of New Mexico Press**_**: The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E letters: selected 1970s correspondence of Bruce Andrews, Charles Bernstein, and Ron Silliman_, _ed. by Matthew Hofer and Michael Golston (2019, xiv + 426 pp., $75). Rev. by Solveig Daugaard,Textual Cultures_, _Spring 2020, **_**13**_**(1)._

Frankly, it is not easy to keep track of which Bob, Barbara or Robin is being discussed now, or to decipher the frequently appearing internal acronyms for writers, organizations and works of poetry. Giving the full name would also support the practice suggested in the ‘Note on the Text’, that the index of names be used in lieu of more expansive notes; as it is, looking up a Bob or Robin in the index is futile.

## Indexes omitted

_**_**Diaphanes**_**: The projectionists: Eadweard Muybridge and the future projections of the moving image_, _by Stephen Barber (2020, 208 pp., $35). Rev. by Marta Braun, Nineteenth Century Theatre and Film (n.d.)_

_The Projectionists_ (the ‘C’ is missing on the spine) is not meant for film historians. They would do better with Stephen Herbert’s 2004 _Eadweard Muybridge The Kingston Museum Bequest_ or Deac Rossell’s pioneering work on Anschütz or the Sklandowskys. There is little academic infrastructure here, few references, no index and many errors.

**Ebury Press**: _A cure for darkness: the story of depression and how we treat it_, by Alex Riley (2021, 464 pp., £18.99). Rev. by Oliver Kamm, _The Times_, 24 April 2021.

Oddly, the book doesn’t give a definition of depression, although the difference between conventional sadness and psychiatric disorder is quite fundamental. And, inexcusable from a leading publisher, there is no index.

**Eerdmans**: _The ancient Mediterranean social world: a sourcebook_, ed. by Zeba A. Crook (2020, xliii + 348 pp., $65). Rev. by Daniel K. Eng, _The Expository Times_, **132**(5), 2021.

A few caveats are in order. The introductions and commentary are written with modern western readers in mind. The authors sometimes presume that the reader holds values that differ from that of the ancient Mediterranean. Also, one who wishes to use this volume for reference may be frustrated with the lack of an index, for either subjects or ancient sources.

**Fourth Estate**: _One two three four: the Beatles in time_, by Craig Brown (2020, 656 pp., £9.20 pbk). Rev. by Anthony Quinn, _The Guardian_, 5 March 2021.

One _Two Three Four_ hasn’t the authority or the insight of Ian MacDonald’s sacred _Revolution in the Head_, and lacking an index it isn’t as useful as Philip Norman’s 1981 biography _Shout!_

**Harper Collins**: _Jews don’t count_, by David Baddiel (2021, 144 pp., £9.99). Rev. by Charles Harris, _Camden New Journal_, 31 March 2021.

And a third \[quibble\]: no index. I’m sure many readers will want to refer back to specific passages, and in a book like this, however brief, an index has to be a must.

_**_**Oxbow**_**: The earliest Europeans, a year in the life: seasonal survival strategies in the Lower Palaeolithic_, _by Robert Hosfield (2020, 416 pp., £24.99). Rev. by Robert C. Power, Antiquity_, _February 2021._

Despite the overall strong format, a detailed list of figures and feature box topics would be useful to the reader, as would an index.

_**_**Pelagic Publication**_**: Raptor prey remains: a guide to identifying what’s been eaten by a bird of prey_, _by Ed Drewitt (2020, 256 pp., £24.99). Rev. by Anthony Wetherhill, British Trust for Ornithology News_, _Spring 2021._

A source of frustration for both of us \[the reviewer and his partner\] was the lack of an index, requiring that the taxonomic order be known to find a species using the contents page.

**Penguin Classics**: _The Penguin book of feminist writing_, ed. by Hannah Dawson (2021, 704 pp., £25). Rev. by Rachel Cooke, _The Observer_, 21 March 2021.

What an excellent idea to put in one place some of the most inspiriting, vital and controversial writing about gender inequality you’ll ever read. This is long overdue. But there is a problem here: an own goal so enraging, it makes you wonder if women aren’t sometimes their own worst enemies. Having laboured to put this book together, its editor, Hannah Dawson, and whoever signed off the project at Penguin Classics have undone their good work at a stroke by making it close to impossible for the reader properly to use it. Not only does it have no general index, it does not even have one of its writers. Only by going painstakingly through the list of contents could I be absolutely sure that, no, nothing by Kate Millett is included; when I wanted to reread something I’d enjoyed by Susan Sontag, I ended up flicking through its 652 pages three times. However magnificent its selections, as a resource it is absolutely hopeless. Nothing in it can be found with any speed. No cross referencing may be done with ease. In this sense, it did indeed remind me of a rape alarm. In the heat of the moment, it’s totally inadequate, pathetic, no good at all.

_**_**Potomac Books**_**: Rage: narcissism, patriarchy, and the culture of terrorism_, _by Abigail R. Esman (2020, 264 pp., $29.95). Rev. in Perspectives on Terrorism_, _**_**14**_**(5)._

The book also lacks an index.

**Spectrum**: _De slavernij in Oost en West: Het Amsterdam-onderzoek_, ed. by Pepijn Brandon, Guno Jones, Nancy Jouwe and Matthias van Rossum (2020, 448 pp., €24.99). Rev. by Harry A. Poeze, _Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde_, **177** (2021).

The Amsterdam volume unfortunately lacks an index.

By the way …

_**_**Bodley Head**_**: The double life of Bob Dylan, vol. 1, 1941–1966: a restless hungry feeling_, _by Clinton Heylin (2021, 528 pp., £30). Rev. by Dalya Alberge, The Guardian_, _21 April 2021._

\[Howard\] Sounes says he bought Heylin’s book reluctantly after hearing that it contained disparaging comments about himself. He was taken aback to find eight listings under his name in the index, beginning with page 3, where he is attacked as ‘a former tabloid reporter aka professional dirtdigger, name of Howard Sounes’, whose Dylan biography is ‘a depressingly well-trundled, semi-literate stroll’.

Sounes joked that Heylin’s index has more page references to him than to Bruce Springsteen: ‘The introduction is all about how great \[Heylin\] is and then how awful everybody else is who’s written about Bob Dylan

\[Sounes is the author of a rival Dylan biography, _Down the highway: the life of Bob Dylan,_ which, according to the reviewer, has sold nearly 200,000 copies and has been reprinted repeatedly over 20 years. An updated edition was released in April 2021 by Doubleday.\]

**William Collins**: _Francis Bacon: revelations_, by Mark Stevens and Annalyn Swan (2021, 870 pp., £30). Rev. by Charles Darwent, _Literary Review_, 493, February 2021.

The entry for ‘Bacon, Francis, SEXUAL LIFE’ in the index runs to twenty-four lines and includes entries such as ‘attracted to father, 48–9’, ‘animals in upbringing, 49–50’ and ‘taste for women’s undergarments, 52, 446’. Despite the indelicate promise of these, the authors’ handling of them is the opposite of salacious.

_**_**Eerdmans**_**: Covenant of peace: the missing peace in New Testament theology and ethics_, _by Willard Swartley (2006, 560 pp., £48.99). Rev. by Christopher Landau, A theology of disagreement: New Testament ethics for ecclesial conflicts (SCM Press, 2021)._

Swartley’s approach to examining the question of whether peace has been overlooked as a theme in the writing of ethicists focused on the text of the New Testament is undeniably eccentric, placing great emphasis on an analysis of indices and chapter headings in scholarly works. It is an approach that is over-reliant on the signposting within a theological text, and presumes that peace only exists as a theme when the specific word ‘peace’ is mentioned – which rather risks undermining the potential for the exploration of metaphor and allegory.

**Weidenfeld & Nicolson**: _Henry ‘Chips’ Channon: The diaries 1918–38_, ed. by Robert Rhodes James (1967, 496 pp.). Rev. by Richard Davenport-Hines, _Times Literary Supplement,_ 5 March 2021.

The diaries’ first outing came in 1967. Robert Rhodes James, a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, was induced to give his editorial name to an expurgated version of them. He did not see the original text, which Channon had bequeathed to his boyfriend Peter Coats. Instead he was provided with typed transcripts after Coats had slashed great chunks of the manuscripts with a blue pencil. In his editorial introduction Rhodes James wrote of Coats providing ‘a complete typescript’, although he must have known that his working version was bowdlerized. Rhodes James’s editorial work, in the way of explanatory footnotes, was scant. His inattentiveness extended to the production of the finished volume by Weidenfeld and Nicolson. He told me in 1969 that ‘prolonged absences abroad’ had kept him from adequate checks on the production of the book. The omissions, errors and muddle of _Chips_ mortified him: ‘I protested most bitterly to Weidenfeld about the Channon Index – alas, too late’, he wrote to me; but the negligence was his.

_\[Richard Davenport-Hines, asked what was wrong with the index, has commented:_

It’s a terrible mess. Very few places indexed; many people omitted; many people oddly named (who would think to index someone called Vita Nicolson?); people with twenty undifferentiated locators; total inconsistency in the use of titles, diminutives, nicknames &c.; incomplete indexing of people and some subjects (which is worse than no mention at all); ten lines of undistinguished locators on Anthony Eden; utter inconsistency in the entry on Winston Churchill, and so forth.\]

_**Weidenfeld & Nicolson**: The mirror and the palette: rebellion, revolution and resilience: 500 years of women’s self-portraits, by Jennifer Higgie (2021, 328 pp., £20). Rev. by Laura Freeman, The Spectator, 1 May 2021._

Kenneth Clark’s _The Nude_ (1956) musters not one woman painter or sculptor. In the index under ‘woman’ are listed: ‘condemnations of; crouching; old; nudes of; prehistoric; as virgin.’

Monica not found

My second motive for writing Monica’s life _**\[**Monica Jones, Philip Larkin and me: her life and long loves_, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2021\] was that she has been written unfairly out of the Larkin script. Look at the indexes of the biographies. And she has been unfairly slandered. Read _Lucky Jim._

John Sutherland, _The Oldie_ newsletter, 30 April 2021

A blatant plug

With a new volume of diaries out last week _**\[**Diaries: volume 8: Rise and Fall of the Olympic Spirit, 2010–2015_, Biteback Press\], forgive me a blatant plug, but anyone who has read the latest or the previous seven volumes will know that it has not all been unalloyed bliss. Indeed, when the first volume was published, Fiona wrote a piece about her index entry, full of references to being cross, angry, fed up, hostile. No fewer than 15 references to rows about when to leave Number 10, and one reference to her being ‘happy and relaxed’, on page 755. The book ended two pages later.
