## Abstract

In the late fourteenth century, Domenico Bandini of Arezzo provided an introduction to his index of the _Genealogy of the pagan gods_ that explained its purpose and use. Michael Robertson has translated it from the original Latin for us. Even after hundreds of years, the words of this early indexer will resonate with modern-day indexers – and perhaps make them just a little jealous that they are not able to provide such useful justifications for their work at the start of every index.

The _Genealogy of the pagan gods_, a compendium of classical mythology compiled (in Latin) by Italian poet Giovanni Boccaccio (1313–75), was indexed by the scholar Domenico Bandini of Arezzo (_c._1335–1418) at the request of Coluccio Salutati, chancellor of Florence (Hankey, [1957](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.20#core-R1); Wilkins, [1923](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.20#core-R5); [1927](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.20#core-R6)). Bandini’s index appeared in several of the early manuscript copies of the _Genealogy_ in the late fourteenth century and also in the early printed editions of the work (Wilkins, [1923](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.20#core-R5): 315). As the latest translator of the _Genealogy_ notes, the index, ‘containing 1966 entries – keyed to book and chapter numbers, and alphabetized to the second letter – was one of the most comprehensive indices \[_sic_\] applied to a work of European scholarly literature at that time and one of the first to be committed to print’ (Solomon, [2011](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.20#core-R3)). The index was compiled at some time between 1376 and 1390 (Wilkins, [1923](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.20#core-R5): 319). For such an early index, it is also remarkable that Bandini proudly claims his own authorship of it at the end of its introductory paragraph (‘I, Domenico of Arezzo, doctor and professor of grammar and of rhetoric’).

Bandini’s was not the first alphabetical index to have been compiled during the Middle Ages and early Renaissance. By the thirteenth century, Cistercian abbeys in France and Flanders and the university in Paris had already developed reference systems that divided manuscripts arbitrarily into numbered parts subdivided by letters of the alphabet, to provide locators for alphabetical index entries (Rouse and Rouse, [1983](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.20#core-R2): 80–3; cf. also Wellisch, [1991](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.20#core-R4): 240–1). Indexes with this type of locator were thus independent of folio or page numbering and could apply universally to any manuscript copies that were made. Similarly, Boccaccio’s _Genealogy_ is divided into 14 books, each of which is in turn divided into chapters, and these divisions are used as locators in Bandini’s index: for example, ‘Patroclus occiditur ab hectore lib. vi. ca. xxiii. Idem ponitur lib. xii. c. li.’ (‘Patroclus is killed by Hector, book 6 chapter 23; the same is laid in the tomb, book 12 chapter 51’). As in this case, a kind of subentry is applied using ‘idem’ in many entries (often with multiple subentries per heading).

The index is preceded by an introduction in which Bandini explains its purpose to the reader; the text from the fourth printed edition (Venice, 1494) is reproduced here ([Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.20#F1)), with the following translation from the Latin.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.20#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup>

## \[Introduction\]

As this work concerning the genealogy of the pagan gods is of such length, it is clear that the book is made more accessible by having the chapter headings collected in one place at the top, where they can be consulted. Even among the chapter headings, however, it is extremely difficult for someone who wants to find a certain story or fable, without having to read practically the whole thing.

Another table is therefore presented below, arranged by the alphabet, so that an inquirer may be able to locate what he is seeking more easily, in addition to using the table of chapter headings. Just as those chapter headings are a listing of the entire book, this table similarly is a listing of headings. It is also possible to refer to the whole work using this alphabetically arranged table. If you look at the letter with which the name starts, you will come to the story that is being sought, and in this way the book in which the name and story appear can be found more easily. Thus by turning to this table of headings and referring to it you can quickly locate what you are looking for.

I have undertaken this task at the request of the distinguished Coluccio di Pierio, Chancellor of Florence. I, Domenico of Arezzo, doctor and professor of grammar and of rhetoric, shall thus by God’s grace begin, and it follows below.
