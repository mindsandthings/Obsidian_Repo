**The no-nonsense guide to born-digital content**. Heather Ryan and Walker Sampson. London: Facet Publishing, 2018. 207 pp. ISBN 978 1 78330 195 9 (pbk), _£_59.95; ISBN 978 1 78330 256 7 (ebook).

More than simply ‘no-nonsense’, Heather Ryan and Walker Sampson have written an indispensable guide to born-digital content that is absolutely worthy of winning the 2019 Preservation Publication Award from the Society of American Archivists (SAA). Born-digital content is that which originates in digital form, rather than having been converted from the analogue. Chapter 1 takes the reader back to basics, using an informal and friendly tone to introduce (or reintroduce!) the concepts of digital encoding, files and media. If you’ve previously missed out on these beginner-level elements of information science, you’ll find this an accessible way to start, facilitated by authors who are alert to the anxiety these topics are known to elicit.

The following chapters are organized into a process-oriented framework for the selection, acquisition, description and preservation of digital content. Chapter 7 is of particular note, as it is focused on the design and implementation of collection management workflows. This book will absolutely be of use to information organizations that are just beginning to deal with born-digital content. However, the real benefit of this book lies in the varieties of born-digital formats discussed. For those organizations recently in receipt of archives from the 1980s and 1990s, older physical media are covered in detail (including floppy disks, hard drives and CDs) as well as more recent network-born content (such as websites and email). Access strategies are dealt with in a separate chapter, exploring not just software, hardware and infrastructure needs, but legal aspects of collection and archiving. Unfortunately, those readers looking to skip straight to the case studies (or ‘use cases’, as they are occasionally labelled in this text) are out of luck, as these do not appear to be listed in the index as a set.

## Editor’s note

The ebook version of this book appears to be a PDF version of the print version with a passive (not hyperlinked) index. Romany kindly gave me permission to add a few more points about the index, which we both agree could have been better. In particular, cross-referencing was not well considered and the structure of headings was poor.

For example, cross-references such as that in [Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.21#F1) might have easily been double-posted:

The entry in [Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.21#F2) contains sub-headings that list platforms with the same locator (and note also the lack of indentation for turnover lines).

And some of the main entries were simply headings copied directly from the text, such as in [Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.21#F3) (note also the awkward turnover).

The pair of entries in [Figure 4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.21#F4) defies logic as there is no entry at DIP.

As I have noted previously in my ‘Indexes behaving badly’ series ([Coe, 2016](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.21#core-r1); [2017](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.21#core-r2); [2018](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.21#core-r3)), it is sad to see books in the library and information science (LIS) field that contain such poor examples of indexing. If you should come across any that are worthy of reviewing in _The Indexer_, please contact me at [editor@theindexer.org](mailto:editor@theindexer.org).
