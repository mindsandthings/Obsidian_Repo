## Abstract

Some of the rules for indexing Arabic names are different for premodern and modern names, while other rules hold for both premodern and modern. This article helps the indexer to recognize those names that cannot be split, and to recognize honorifics, titles and, in premodern names, certain types of _nisbas_ (descriptors) that should not be used as the entry point. Indexers should follow the author’s lead in finding the entry point for premodern names. Rules for inverting modern names and tips for correct sorting are also given.

In the indexes of books on Islamic studies and Middle East politics or history, errors are sometimes found in the indexing of Arabic names. Indexers seem to have a penchant for inverting any name they see, but in some cases Arabic names should not be inverted. Other Arabic names _should_ be inverted, but indexers have not always recognized when the last element in a name is in fact part of a compound name that should not be split, or it is an honorific that should not be mistaken for a surname. Heather Hedden ([2007](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.7#core-R2)) wrote an excellent ‘Centrepiece’ article in this journal on indexing Arabic names over ten years ago, but there is still need for further instruction on this subject.

## Premodern and modern names

The first rule in indexing Arabic names is to realize that premodern and modern names are handled differently. European-style names with an identifiable given name and a family name that passes down from generation to generation only appeared in Arab countries in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and at different times in different places (Hedden, 2007: C11). Even today, many people use their father’s given name as a second name, rather than a family name. In Egypt (the country I am most familiar with), for example, on legal documents requiring four names, people use their given name, their father’s name and their paternal grand-father’s name, followed by either their great-grandfather’s name or a family name. They do not use _bint_ (daughter of) or _ibn/bin_ (son of), as was done in the premodern era. In other contexts people might use only their own name and their father’s name; or their own name and their grandfather’s name; or their own name and the family name; or their own name, their father’s name and the family name. Many Egyptians are inconsistent in this and use different forms of their name in different contexts. In a modern book, however, one would expect to see people called consistently by the same names.

Premodern names often have various epithets and honorifics that may appear in different orders and may or may not be the entry point in an index.

In the following sections, the information on the definite article, what names not to split, and so on, is true for both premodern and modern names. However, rules about inverting names may not apply in non-Arab countries. Muslim Malaysians, for example, use Arabic names but their names are not inverted in catalogues and indexes (see [IFLA, 1996](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.7#core-R3)).

Another difficulty with Arabic names is that there is wide variation in spelling. Academic books covering the premodern era are usually less of a problem in this because they generally use a set system of transliteration. In modern names, there is more variation because individuals have their own way of spelling their name, which may be influenced by local pronunciation or the predominant colonial language. This should be less of a problem for an indexer than for a copy-editor, but an indexer does need to recognize variations in the spelling of some words – especially the definite article, _Abu_ and _ʿAbd al-_. There may also be difficulties if an embedded index is created in the Word document before copy-editing and the author has not been careful about spelling. Spelling variations are not addressed here in detail and names are written without diacritics. Heather Hedden (2007) has written about spelling variations, and I have written about them in a series of blog posts on _An American Editor_ ([Mischler, 2017](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.7#core-R5)).

## Diacritics, _ʿayn_ and _hamza_

Along with variations in spelling, the indexer should keep an eye out for inadvertent variations in the use of diacritics and in transliterations of the letters _ʿayn_ and _hamza_. Diacritics in Arabic transliteration usually consist of macrons over some vowels and dots under some consonants. Some transliteration systems use other diacritics. In any case, there are likely to be inconsistencies in the use of diacritics. If indexers know enough Arabic to recognize which form of the word is correct, they should enter the word as it should be in the index and tell clients to proofread carefully. (I rarely mark individual cases of wrong spellings because there are usually many in a text.) Obviously, indexers who do not know any Arabic will have to query which spelling is correct.

Even when diacritics are not used, many books show the letters _ʿayn_ and _hamza_, either as opening and closing single quotation marks respectively, or as half circles opening to the right and left respectively. Again, there are likely to be inconsistencies in these. Indexers who know Arabic, and are able to correct them in the index, should do so; otherwise a query should be raised with the client. It is possible, of course, for an author to be consistent but wrong. In such situations, the word should be indexed correctly and the client alerted.

If an author uses single quotation marks for ʿ_ayn_ and _hamza_, it is advisable to turn off the Smart Quotes in both the indexing software and Word, and copy and paste names into the indexing program, rather than typing them. It may be that half the problems with these letters stem from Word’s attempt to be helpful with Smart Quotes.

Some indexers may prefer to code these diacritics. I suggest using angle brackets opening in the same direction: that is, < for ‘ or ʿ for ʿ_ayn_; and > for ’ or ʾ for _hamza_. However, when writing an embedded index, angle brackets should not be used because Word reads these as commands to ignore text. In such situations, I use \[3\] for ʿ_ayn_ (ع) because it looks like a backwards 3, and \[2\] for _hamza_ (ء) because it looks like a backwards 2, but anything that is easy to remember can be used (see Mischler, [2018](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.7#core-R6); [2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.7#core-R7), for more on this).

## The definite article al- and its variants

The definite article is usually spelled _al-_ in transliteration, but in modern names it might be spelled _el-_ (especially in Egypt), and it is often spelled _ul-_ in compound names. In speech the _l_ of the article is assimilated into the sounds represented by _d_ (د), ḍ (ض), _dh_ (ذ), _l_ (ل), _n_ (ن), _r_ (ر), _s_ (س), ṣ (ص), _sh_ (ش), _t_ (ت), ṭ (ط), _th_ (ث), _z_ (ز) and _ẓ_ (ظ). Most styles do not show the assimilation except in the transliteration of poetry or prayers, where pronunciation is important, but some people spell their names to show the assimilation, and it might be found in religious texts. It is important to recognize that these variations are the definite article and should be treated in the same way as _al-_.

While the definite article is usually lower-cased in academic works, it may be capitalized by some individuals and organizations in their names. It might be attached with a hyphen or written as a separate word. Examples of this are the media company Al Jazeera (sorted under J) and al Mohtaraf design studio (sorted under M).

In some styles, the definite article is used only the first time on personal names and is dropped on subsequent mentions. This is the usual style in newspapers and should be familiar to indexers and readers. For example, Bashar al-Assad and Assad are easily recognized as being the same person. If an author uses the article on the first mention and drops it on subsequent mention, index it with the article, which is the correct name. If the article and the name are written as one word, then treat the article as part of the name rather than as an article. For example, the Egyptian diplomat Mohamed ElBaradei spells his name as one word and is indexed under E. However, his sister apparently spells the surname with a hyphen and is indexed under B.

When the article comes at the beginning of a main entry, Chicago style (16.75) moves the article to the end, but some publishers keep it in its place and ignore it in sorting. The client should be consulted about house style or the alphabetization style used in the references should be followed.

The vowel of the article might be elided after a long vowel – such as in the name _Abu_. The elision might be shown by writing the word and the _l_ of the article as one word – _Abul_ (or _Aboul_ in some spellings) – or the elided vowel might be shown with an apostrophe. If this is the style the author uses, make sure that an apostrophe and not an opening quotation mark is used before the _l_. Some styles do not write an apostrophe with the elision.

When the second element of a name begins with the article, it is ignored in sorting – including ʾ _l_ or _l_ used instead of the full article. If the index has a lot of names beginning with the same element, such as _ʿAbd_, _Abu_, or _Ibn_, it is best to sort word-by-word. This is especially important when there is a mix of premodern and modern names.

Table 1. Examples of correct and incorrect sorting with the article

| Incorrect sorting | Correct sorting | Incorrect sorting | Correct sorting |

| Ibn al-Athir | Ibn al-Athir | Dar al-Ayyam li-l-Sahafa | Dar al-Ayyam li-l-Sahafa |

## Clan and family names

### Āl or Al and Bā or Ba

_Āl_ means ‘clan’ or ‘dynasty’. In modern Arabic script it is written لآwith a tilde-like mark over the _alif_; in Qur’anic script it may appear as لاء. In Arabic script it is written as a separate word, not attached to the following word as the definite article is, and the letter _l_ is not assimilated in pronunciation. _Āl_ is never suppressed in sorting or moved to the end. It is usually capitalized in English. It is primarily found in royal names, which are never inverted, and in names of clans. Another example is the Iranian novelist Jalal Al-e Ahmad. The _Al_ is the borrowed Arabic word for ‘family’, so he is indexed as Al-e Ahmad, Jalal.

The word _Bā_ or _Ba_ is found in Yemeni names and it has a similar meaning. It may or may not be hyphenated. Do not split it from the following name and do not suppress it in sorting.

### Ibn, bin, ben, b. and bint, bt.

_Ibn_ and its variations mean ‘son of’; _bint_ and the abbreviated _bt._ mean ‘daughter of’. When they occur between names they are usually lower-cased and should be ignored in sorting. (When they come at the beginning is different and is discussed below.) In premodern names it is possible to get a string of names like Iman bint Yusuf ibn Ahmad (Iman daughter of Yusuf son of Ahmad) or Mustafa ibn Hisham ibn ʿAmr (Mustafa son of Hisham son of ʿAmr). Simple premodern names such as these – that is, without honorifics or epithets – should be indexed as they appear, without inverting. In modern names, such strings are usually only seen in names of royalty, which are never inverted.

The variations in _ibn_ may be grammatical or stylistic. One publisher uses _bin_ for Gulf royalty, _ben_ for names from North Africa (where it is the usual spelling), and _ibn_ for other names. Other publishers might consistently use _b_. This is another reason to ignore these words in sorting, especially when variations appear in the index.

_Bin_ or _Ben_ might be part of a family name, in which case it should be capitalized in English. It should not be ignored in sorting and should not be split from the following name. Examples are Osama Bin Laden and Bin Laden Group. Bin Laden is the family name. Osama is not Osama son of Laden. He is indexed as Bin Laden, Osama. Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, the former president of Tunisia, has the family name Ben Ali and is indexed as Ben Ali, Zine El Abidine (Hedden, 2007: C13).

## Compound names that cannot be split

Arabic has many compound names that are identifiable by one of their elements; the most common ones are discussed here. Do not split these. That is, do not invert; do not move only one element and not the whole thing. The identifiable compounds are based on the genitive construction (_iḍafa_) and usually, but not always, the second element begins with the definite article _al-_, which should be ignored in sorting.

### _Ibn_ + \[something\]

When _Ibn_ (son of) comes at the beginning of a name rather than between two names, it is captitalized in English. There are many medieval personalities who are known simply as _Ibn_ + \[something\]. The ‘something’ might be the name of a father or ancestor, or the whole name might be a nickname. For example, the nickname of the fifteenth-century Egyptian hadith scholar Ibn Hajar al-ʿAsqalani means ‘son of stone’; _al-ʿAsqalani_ indicates that the family originated in ʿAsqalan some generations before him. He is indexed as Ibn Hajar al-ʿAsqalani, sorted on I.

Here are some other names of this type – alphabetized as they should be, with the _al-_ ignored: Ibn al-ʿArabi (also known as Ibn ʿArabi without the definite article), Ibn Battuta, Ibn al-Hajib, Ibn al-Hajj, Ibn Hazm, Ibn Khaldun, Ibn Taghribirdi and Ibn Taymiyyah.

### Bint + \[something\]

_Bint_ (daughter of) is the feminine counterpart of _Ibn_ and can occur as the first element of a compound name that is not split. Bint al-Shatiʾ (literally ‘daughter of the riverbank’), the pen name of Aisha Abd al-Rahman, is indexed as written, without a comma and sorted under B.

### Abu + \[something\]

_Abu_ + \[something\] (literally ‘father of \[something\]’) forms a type of nickname known as a _kunya_. The ‘something’ is usually the name of the man’s eldest son, but the _kunya_ might be used to indicate a trait. In the medieval period people were addressed by their _kunya_ and might be known primarily by it instead of their real name.

This form of name is still used in some Arab cultures today and may appear as a surname, nickname or pen name. Like other compound names, it is not split and if there is an article on the second element, it is ignored in sorting. Thus the Egyptian writer, poet and historian Muhammad Farid Abu Hadid (1893–1967) is indexed as Abu Hadid, Muhammad Farid. The Palestinian Abu Nidal is indexed as written, possibly with a gloss of his real name (Sabri Khalil al-Banna), possibly with an entry at al-Banna, Sabri Khalil (sorted under B) with a _see_ reference to Abu Nidal.

Note that if _Abu_ is preceded by _ibn_ or _bint_, it becomes _Abi_ (or _Abī_), and the entire sequence of _ibn/bint Abi_ + \[something\] should not be split.

### Umm + \[something\]

_Umm_ + \[something\] (literally, ‘mother of \[something\]’) is the feminine form of the _kunya_. Like the masculine form, it may refer to a woman’s eldest son, such as in the case of Umm Salama (mother of Salama), or it may indicate a trait. The given name Umm Kulthum (also spelled Kulsum or Kalsum) means ‘one with chubby cheeks’. It was used as the stage name of the Egyptian singer Fatima Ibrahim el-Sayyid el-Batagi, who is indexed as Umm Kulthum. If the second element has the definite article, as in the case of Umm al-Qura (‘mother of towns’, a nickname for Mecca), the article is ignored in sorting.

### ʿAbd + \[something\]

This compound, meaning ‘servant of’ or ‘slave of’, is one of the most common. The second element is usually, but not always, one of the names of God, and there is usually a definite article on the second element, which leads to various spellings in modern names. Sort word-by-word and ignore the definite article if it is not attached to the first element, in order to bring common spellings together:

> ʿAbdallah, Jamil
> 
> ʿAbd al-Hamid II
> 
> ʿAbd Rabbihi
> 
> ʿAbd al-Rahman III
> 
> ʿAbd al-Rahman, Sayyid
> 
> ʿAbd al-Samad, ʿAbd al-Qadir
> 
> ʿAbdel Ghani, Mahmoud
> 
> Abdul-Jabbar, Kareem

The one exception to this, by convention, is the name of the Egyptian president Gamal ʿAbd al-Nasser, who is usually referred to in text as Nasser and indexed as Nasser, Gamal ʿAbd al-, rather than as ʿAbd al-Nasser, Gamal. If an author ignores this convention and refers to him as ʿAbd al-Nasser, he should be indexed in the same way, but with a _see_ cross-reference under Nasser (see Hedden, 2007: C13).

It is, of course, common practice for an author to use only a surname on subsequent mention. However, on occasion an author may erroneously use only the second element without _ʿAbd_: for example, referring to Sayyid ʿAbd al-Rahman as al-Rahman rather than ʿAbd al-Rahman. Al-Rahman is a name of God and cannot be used for a human. If such a mistake occurs in a book, the name should be indexed correctly with _ʿAbd_ and the client warned to correct the text.

### \[Something\] + al-Din

Several compounds made of \[something\] + _al-Din_ (‘\[something\] of the faith’) are common names in modern Arabic, and many more such compounds serve as a form of honorific in medieval names. In modern names the _al-_ might be spelled _ad-_, _ed-_, or _ud-_ to show the assimilation of the letter _l_, and the article might be attached to the second word. _Din_ might be spelled _Deen_ or _Dine_. Common modern compounds are Nur al-Din, Saif al-Din, Salah al-Din and Shams al-Din.

### \[Something\] + Allah

A few names, now primarily surnames, are formed with _Allah_ as the second element:

Farag Allah, Faraj Allah, Hasab Allah, Khair Allah.

### Dhu (or Zu) + \[something\]

_Dhu_ or _Zu_ is a combining word in a few names. The ‘u’ is a long vowel here, so the vowel of the article elides in pronunciation and this might be shown in various spellings, or the names might be written as one word: Dhu ’l-Qarnayn, Dhu’l-Qarnayn, Dhu-l-Qarnayn, Dhul Qarnayn, Dhu al-Kifl, Dhul Kifl, Dhu al-Faqar, Zulfaqar.

### Miscellaneous genitive compounds

A number of names of prominent people have on occasion been wrongly indexed. These names are also genitive constructions and should not be split. Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, a former president of Pakistan, appeared in one index as ul-Haq, Zia, with no sign of the first name. I could not access the text to see how the author had written the name, but the surname is always shown hyphenated. He should be indexed as Zia-ul-Haq, Muhammad. As mentioned earlier, the former president of Tunisia, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, has Ben Ali as his surname. His given name is also a genitive-construction compound, which has also been used for other people with different spellings: Zine El Abidine, Zain al-Abidin, Zayn al-ʿAbidin. These should not be split.

## Honorifics and titles

In the medieval period, honorifics were widely used. They can appear first, last, or somewhere else in a string of names and titles. They can often be recognized by their genitive construction (see [Beeston, 1971](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.7#core-R1)):

> \[something\] + al-Din
> 
> \[something\] + al-Dawla
> 
> \[something\] + al-Mulk
> 
> \[something\] + al-Dunya wal-Din

Other Arabic honorifics usually appear before the name. Some of the common ones are these: al-Sharif, Maulay or Maula, Sayyid (masculine) or Sayyida (feminine). The Wikipedia page ‘Category: Islamic honorifics’ lists others.<sup>1</sup> In the Ottoman period, titles and honorifics go after the name. These are the more common ones: Pasha; Bey, Bay, Beg or Bek; Hanim; Efendi or Effendi; Aga or Agha. More are listed in Wikipedia under Ottoman titles. Strictly speaking, these titles are Turkish, but they were used with Arabic names and, at least in Egypt, sometimes conferred on Europeans.

Some of these were still in use in Egypt up until the Free Officers Revolution of 1952. They should not be mistaken for surnames. Saʿd Zaghlul Pasha is indexed as Zaghlul Pasha, Saʿd or Zaghlul, Saʿd. Fouad Kamal Bey is indexed as Kamal Bey, Fouad.

Titles of offices often come before a name, perhaps written with the definite article attached. Common offices are these: _Amir_ or _Emir_ (leader, commander or prince); _Amira_ (Princess); _Ayatollah_ (a high-ranking Shiite religious authority); _Imam_ (ranges from an Islamic ruler to a high-ranking scholar to a prayer leader in a local mosque); _Malik_ (king); _Malika_ (queen); _Mufti_ (a scholar who interprets Islamic law); _Qadi_ (judge); _Shaykh_ or _Sheikh_ (an elder or religious leader), including _Shaykh al-Islam_ and _Shaykh al-Azhar_.

Generally, honorifics and titles should not be used as the entry point (see [IFLA, 2018](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.7#core-R4)), although some medieval names with _Qadi_ may be exceptions if the persons are well known by that name.

### Names looking like honorifics and titles

Some titles and honorifics have also become names. As a given name rather than a

title, they are usually without the definite article _al-_:

> al-Qadi (modern family name)
> 
> Imam (rare name)
> 
> (al-)Shaykh or (el-)Sheikh (name or family name)
> 
> (al-)Sharif or (al-)Sherif (name)
> 
> Malik/Malika (name)
> 
> Amir/Amira (name)
> 
> al-Sayyid (name)

How can one tell if these are names or titles? In a modern name, if one of these comes second or third, it is a name because titles come first. If it comes first, context will likely indicate whether it is a name or a title. Titles, except for religious titles, are less likely in modern names. Is this an ordinary person, or a ruler or a religious authority? _Imam_ can be applied to a wide range of offices, including the prayer leader at a local mosque (similar to a minister), and is rare as a name. If online sources do not clarify the matter, the author should be consulted.

## Modern names

Modern Arabic names are relatively easy to index – once the indexer can remember which names not to split and can recognize honorifics at the end. Usually the context will make it clear if a name is modern, and the form of modern names is usually simply two to four names without any form of _ibn_ or _bint_ between them. If there is a generational family name – more common in some countries than in others – it will often, but not always, start with _al-_ or _el-_ and end with _i_ (which may be written as _ī_ or _y_).

If it is the name of a royal person, it is usually written with _bint_ (only after the first name) or _bin_ between names. Royal names should be indexed in the order given, with no inversion.

If the person is not royal, the last element is identified, ignoring titles, and moved to the beginning to be the entry point. If the last element is a compound name, all of it is moved. If _al-_ is at the beginning of the new first element (after inversion), it can either be coded to be ignored or moved back to the end if that is what the style calls for.

## Premodern names

Some premodern names are simple. Especially in the early Islamic period, it is not unusual for someone to be called by just one or two elements, and many of the great scholars are known by a short form of their name:

> Abu Huraira
> 
> Abu Bakr al-Siddiq
> 
> Anas ibn Malik
> 
> al-Bukhari
> 
> Ibn Khaldun
> 
> Ibn Taymiyya
> 
> al-Tabari
> 
> Umm Salama

Some premodern names might consist of a name followed by _bint_ or _ibn_ + the father’s name, and perhaps one or more _ibn_ + \[something\] to indicate the grandfather and great-grandfather. Simple names like this should be indexed as written, with no inversion:

> Asmaaʾ bint Yusuf ibnʿ Abd al-Rahim ibn Abi Bakr
> 
> Khalid ibn Suhayl ibn Mustafa

Other premodern names can be complex, especially in the medieval period, and the order of elements can vary.

A name can consist of (in various orders):

> a kunya (Abu/Umm + \[something\])
> 
> an ism (given name)
> 
> a nasab consisting of a patronymic (bint/ibn + \[something\]) or genealogic chain
> 
> (bint/ibn + \[something\] + ibn + \[something\] + ibn + \[something\])
> 
> a nisba, which is a tribal designation (beginning with al- and ending in –_ī_)
> 
> a laqab which is a nickname
> 
> a laqab which is an honorific

In later centuries, the _nisba_ could designate a birthplace, residence or ancestral home; a _madhhab_ (school of law); a Sufi order (all usually beginning with _al-_ and ending in _–ī_); or a profession (not following the pattern of beginning with _al-_ and ending in _–ī_). A person might have more than one _laqab_ or _nisba_.

Often a person is best known by something other than their given name (_ism_). This element, called a _shuhra_, might be the _kunya_, _nasab_ (_ibn_/_bint_ + \[something\]), a _nisba_ indicating a birthplace, residence or ancestral home. The _shuhra_ might not be one of the elements given in the person’s name (see Beeston, 1971: 3–7; IFLA, 2018: 2–4).

A modern author might identify the _shuhra_ explicitly by writing something like this: ‘X whose real name was Y’ or ‘Y who is better known as X.’ Such a person should be indexed with X as the entry point. A _see_ cross-reference is not needed from the full or real name, but the other elements of the name should be given after the entry point. Or the author might give a string of names and then use one of them on subsequent mention. That one is the _shuhra_, which should be the entry point.

Premodern (and some modern) authors might refer to the same person by different elements of their name at different points in the text. For example, one fifteenth-century author presented the full name of a scholar who is often known simply by his _nisba_ of al-Bukhari: Abu ʿAbd Allah Muhammad ibn Ismaʿil ibn Ibrahim ibn al-Mughira ibn Bardizbah al-Juʿfi al-Bukhari. The author then variously referred to him as Muhammad, Muhammad ibn Ismaʿil, Ibn Ismaʿil, Abu ʿAbd Allah, al-Bukhari and Imam al-Bukhari.

A modern writer might tell the reader al-Bukhari’s full name, but would likely consistently refer to him as al-Bukhari after that. Indeed, al-Bukhari today is generally known by only that name (a _nisba_ indicating his birthplace of Bukhara), and his other names might not appear. He could be indexed simply as al-Bukhari (his _shuhra_) in a modern text. However, in a modern index of the fifteenth-century text where he is called by various names, the entry point would be al-Bukhari, followed by his _kunya_, _ism_, and the beginning of his _nasab_ to show his father’s name: al-Bukhari, Abu ʿAbd Allah Muhammad ibn Ismaʿil. The entire genealogical chain is not needed to identify him in the index, but the other parts of his name that are used at various points in the text should be included.

Another example of an author giving a name in different forms is ‘ʿAbd al-Haqq al-Azdi al-Ishbili, also known as Ibn al-Kharrat’, who might also appear as ‘ʿAbd al-Haqq al-Ishbili’ or simply as ‘Ibn al-Kharrat’. The indexer has to recognize that these all refer to the same person – al-Azdi and al-Ishbili are both recognizable as _nisbas_ with the usual form of beginning with _al-_ and ending with _i_ – which can be difficult for indexers who do not know any Arabic. In this case, ‘also known as’ signals the entry point. He is indexed as Ibn al-Kharrat, ʿAbd al-Haqq al-Azdi al-Ishbili. If the author uses ʿAbd al-Haqq al-Ishbilii on a page other than where he is first mentioned, the indexer might also have an entry ʿAbd al-Haqq al-Ishbili and double post or have a _see_ cross-reference to Ibn al-Kharrat.

The entry point should not be a _laqab_ that is an honorific (see above for typical patterns to recognize) or a _nisba_ that designates a _madhhab_ (school of law) or Sufi order. The Wikipedia article ‘Madhhab’ lists the four major Sunni schools, the Shia schools, and others that are a small minority or that have died out. The Sufi orders are more numerous. The Wikipedia article ‘List of Sufi orders’ or other online sources should be able to help the indexer recognize a _nisba_ of these sorts so that it is not used as an entry point.

## Follow the author’s lead

The best advice when indexing a work by a modern author is to follow the author’s lead on what is the entry point. By their repeated usage or explicit writing (‘better known as’), the author will usually signal by which of several names a person is known. If there is no such clue in the text but there are several names, any honorifics that come as the first element should be removed and the remaining names indexed in the order given.

## Summary

Many of the difficulties with indexing Arabic names can be overcome by recognizing compound names that cannot be split and titles or honorifics that are not surnames or entry points. Once those are recognized, modern names are easy to index. Premodern names, on the other hand, might be simple or complex. If they are complex, authors might use different forms of the name to refer to the same person, which can cause problems for the indexer. Or authors might use a _shuhra_ – a part of the name or an epithet – which should be used as the entry point in the index. The indexer also has to recognize certain parts of the name – some forms of _laqab_ (titles and honorifics) and some forms of _nisba_ (descriptors referring to the person’s school of jurisprudence or Sufi order) – that are not used as entry points.

The major points are summarized here:

•

Sort word-by-word if there are many Arabic names in the index.

•

Watch that _ʿayn_ and _hamza_ copy correctly.

•

Watch for inconsistencies in diacritics.

•

Ignore _al-_ or move it to the end, depending on the publisher’s style.

•

Ignore _al-_ on second elements.

•

_Al_ (clan/dynasty) is not _al-_ and should not be ignored or separated from the following word. The same applies to _Ba_.

•

Ignore _ibn_, _bin_, _ben_, _b._, _bint_ when they come between names.

•

Watch for _Bin_ or _Ben_ as part of name.

•

Watch for names that cannot be split, the most common of which are these: _Ibn_/_Bint_ + \[something\], _Abu_/_Umm_ + \[something\], _ʿAbd_ + \[something\], \[something\] + _al-Din_, \[something\] + _Allah_, _Dhu_/_Zu_ + \[something\].

•

Watch for honorifics or titles, either at the beginning or the end (in Ottoman usage). Do not use these as entry points.

•

Do not invert names of royalty, whether modern or premodern.

•

Invert modern names, ignoring honorifics and not splitting compound names.

•

For simple premodern names, index in the order given.

•

For complex premodern names, follow the author’s lead to identify the _shuhra_, the name the person is known as.

•

If there is no _shuhra_, index names in the order given, ignoring honorifics or titles at the beginning.
