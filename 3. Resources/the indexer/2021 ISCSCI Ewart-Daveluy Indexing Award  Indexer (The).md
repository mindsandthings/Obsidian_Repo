The 2021 Ewart-Daveluy Indexing award was presented to Stephen Ullstrom on 27 May 2021 at the ‘Indexing Unlimited’ virtual conference held by the Indexing Society of Canada/Société canadienne d’indexation (ISC/SCI). The award honours Stephen’s indexing of _The shield of Psalmic prayer: reflections on translating, interpreting, and praying the Psalter_, by Donald Sheehan, published in 2020 by Ancient Faith Publishing.

The ISC/SCI Ewart-Daveluy Indexing Award is presented each year to an individual who has created an index that demonstrates outstanding expertise in the ability to analyze complex text and to design an index that significantly enhances reader use of the text.

_The shield of Psalmic prayer_ is a collection of essays, study notes, and personal journal entries on interpreting, translating, and praying with the Psalms in light of Orthodox Christian theology. The author, Donald Sheehan, was an English professor and long-time director of the Robert Frost Place in New Hampshire.

The collection was gathered and edited posthumously by Donald’s widow, Xenia Sheehan. Because the text was originally not intended for publication, the pieces are often unfinished and unpolished, which gives the book a contemplative and quiet tone. About two-thirds of the chapters focus exclusively on a specific psalm or two. Stephen’s challenge was to understand these fragments and tie them to the broader themes of the book.

Stephen met the challenge of creating an excellent index. As one judge noted, ‘really nice detail and solid breakdowns under the Psalms.’ Said another, ‘this is a properly done scripture index.’ Other comments included ‘a good solid job on a difficult subject’ and a ‘thorough, thoughtful index.’ Finally, ‘it addresses the main needs of potential users.’

In responding to the award, Stephen said,

> This is a personal index for me. I have dear friends who knew Donald and Xenia Sheehan. When visiting my friends about ten years ago, I first encountered Donald’s translation of the Psalms. My friends had a private copy of the text, which they used in their morning prayers. My visit with them may have also been my introduction to the practice of praying with the Psalms, which Donald kept as a daily practice for over two decades. I am also an Orthodox Christian, which gives me a good background for this project. Having read and benefitted from some of Donald’s other writings, I was honoured to be asked to index this book and am delighted that the index has won the award.

> One challenge is how to handle scripture. The scripture index was fairly straightforward, although I did have to decide which order of Biblical texts to follow. I decided to follow the Orthodox Study Bible, since the author, publisher, and at least part of the audience are Orthodox. The larger challenge was how to handle the specific psalms that Donald discusses extensively. Relying on the scripture index for entry points seemed insufficient, so I double posted those particular psalms in the subject index with subheadings for the discussions. Perhaps my approach can be described as both qualitative and quantitative.

> I initially turned this project down, due to a full schedule and miscommunication, so many thanks to Katherine Hyde at Ancient Faith for asking a second time; to my wife, Elim Ng, for encouragement to take it on after all; and to my indexing colleagues for their friendship and wisdom over the years.
