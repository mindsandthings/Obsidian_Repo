Publication: The Indexer: The International Journal of Indexing

Volume 40, Number 3

These extracts from reviews do not pretend to represent a complete survey of all reviews in journals and newspapers. We offer only a selection from quotations that readers have sent in. Our reproduction of comments is not a stamp of approval from _The Indexer_ upon the reviewer’s assessment of an index. Extracts are arranged alphabetically under the names of publishers, within the sections: Indexes praised; Two cheers!; Indexes censured; Indexes omitted.

## Indexes praised

**Allen Lane**: _Index, a history of the_, by Dennis Duncan (2021, 340 pp, £20). Rev. in _Times Diary_, 31 March 2022.

The Society of Indexers (sorry, ‘Indexers, Society of’) was founded 65 years ago yesterday. A history of their noble profession, likened to squeezing a grape in a winepress so not even a drop of juice can escape, was written by Dennis Duncan last year and has delights in its own index, such as ‘X, no entries beginning with’. Running your finger down an index can produce a fascinating narrative. Only in a biography of John le Carré for instance, will you find the successive entries ‘Abingdon, al-Qaeda, Angola, Ascot, Asda’.

**Bloomsbury**: _Spousal violence among world Christians: silent scandal_, by Elizabeth Koepping (2021, viii + 184 pp, £85/$103.50). Rev. by Carol Wardman, _The Expository Times_ **133**(8).

Given the shocking subject-matter, it feels churlish to criticise at all; but stylistically the book sometimes muddles the academic and anecdotal, and can be repetitive (but then, so is the problem of marital violence) … (There is, however, an excellent index).

**Brill**: _Brill’s encyclopedia of global Pentecostalism_, ed. by Michael Wilkinson, Connie Au, Jörg Haustein and Todd M. Johnson (2021, xlix + 810 pp, €250). Rev. by William K. Kay, _Theology_ **125**(2).

Pentecostalism is a global phenomenon that is fittingly addressed by a big, diverse and well-indexed book.

**Brill**: _Down to the hour: short time in the ancient Mediterranean and Near East_, ed. by Kassandra J. Miller and Sarah L. Symons (2020, xi + 297 pp, €135). Rev. by Annette Imhausen, _Journal for the History of Astronomy_, **53**(1).

An index of four pages at the end combines keywords, locations, persons, and sources.

**Edinburgh University Press**: _Political parties in the Arab world: continuity and change_, ed. by Francesco Cavatorta and Lise Storm (2018, xii + 356 pp, £25.99). Rev. by Clément Steuer, _Party Politics_, **28**(3).

… the list of figures and tables at the beginning of the book, and the index at the end of the volume help the reader to navigate its content efficiently, thus making it easy to use for scholars and students alike.

**Elsevier**: _Pathologic basis of veterinary disease_, ed. by James F. Zachary (7th edn, 2022, 1,490 pp, $155.77). Rev. by Donal O’Toole, _Journal of Veterinary Diagnostic Investigation_, 12 May 2022.

A good index lays open the nerves and sinews of a text. Over 2 months, I dipped into the index to see if it took me promptly to diagnostically pertinent information. I consulted the index on mundane topics (_Clostridium perfringens_, eosinophilic granulomas, feline soft tissue sarcoma, dysautonomia, hemochromatosis/hemosiderosis, histiocytic disorders, amyloidosis, pestiviruses, and several genetic diseases). I found the index to be accurate and helpful. Bolding the page number for sections with the most extensive coverage of a topic would be useful when multiple pages are listed.

**GIA Publications**: _The people’s theology: classic hymns and Christian formation_, by Philip H. Pfatteicher (2020, xxx + 418 pp, $38.95). Rev. by Carl Bear, _Anglican Theological Review_, n.d.

The book also includes a helpful appendix on the historical development of hymns, a glossary of terms, and a thorough index, including all the hymn texts analyzed in the book.

**Lutterworth Press**: _2 Corinthians: A short exegetical and pastoral commentary_, by Anthony C. Thiselton (2020, xii + 157 pp, £17.50). Rev. by Lukas Bormann, _The Expository Times_, **133**(7).

Indexes of names, subjects, and Biblical references complete the book and make it functional for a larger readership and students of the New Testament.

**Norman Publishing**: _Sir William Osler: an encyclopedia_, ed. by Charles S. Bryan (2020, 967 pp, $125). Rev. by Christopher Gardner-Thorpe, _Journal of Medical Biography_, 2022, **30**(1).

One advantage of an encyclopedia is that an index is not essential since the entries are in alphabetical order and this means that dipping into the volume is an easier way ahead rather than a steady read from page one to the final 967th page, a remarkable publishing achievement. Nevertheless an index is included and takes the reader to the finer points of the text provided by the many contributors worldwide and edited by Bryan to result in a massive tome that will be not only a most useful reference work but also will provide much enjoyment from browsing.

**University of Illinois Press**: _Tennis: a history from American amateurs to global professionals_, by Greg Ruth (2021, 317 pp, £106.27 hbk, £18.88 pbk). Rev. by Braham Dabscheck, _Australasian Journal of American Studies_, **40**(2), December 2021.

The extent of Ruth’s research and attention to detail is impressive. His endnotes run to fifty pages, with a twelve-page bibliography and a comprehensive and useful index.

**Yale University Press**: _Going to church in medieval England_, by Nicholas Orme (2021, xi + 483 pp, £34). Rev. by Colmán Ó Clabaigh, _Irish Theological Quarterly_, **87**(2).

In addition to a select bibliography and comprehensive index, it also contains an extensive glossary of technical terms used in the text.

## Indexes censured

**Springer**: _The Palgrave handbook of learning for transformation_, ed. by A. Nicolaides et al. (2022, 956 pp, $279.99 hbk, $219.00 ebook). Rev. by Annalisa L. Raymer, _Adult Education Quarterly_, 9 May 2022.

In such a large tome, is an index a reader’s good friend? Not finding as much joy there as I’d hoped for, I settled in to read. Traveling through the volume I had the sense of getting warmer, as one might when playing a game to uncover a hidden object. It was in Part 4 where my particular thirst was quenched …

**University of North Carolina**: _Children of uncertain fortune: mixed-race Jamaicans in Britain and the Atlantic family 1733–1833_, by Daniel Livesay (2018, xx, 412 pp. $45). Rev. by Christer Petley, _Journal of Family History_ **47**(2).

Its only significant faults lie in a sometimes clumsy structure that struggles to balance a central narrative about change over time with detailed case studies and analysis of specific sources. A much more detailed index could also have been useful to readers wanting to trace the various family and life histories that braid their way through this complex book.

## Indexes omitted

**BHC Press**: _The wandering Palestinian_, by Anan Ameri (2020, 239 pp, $15.95). Rev. by Janice J. Terry, _Arab Studies Quarterly_, (**43**)2, Spring 2021.

Although the memoir does not include an index, there is a useful glossary and endnotes.

**Cascade Books**: _Advanced missiology: how to study missions in credible and useful ways_, by Kenneth Nehrbass (2021, 340 pp, £26.84). Rev. by Kirk J. Franklin, _Transformation_, **39**(2), 2022.

There is no index, so that could be a limitation for serious missiology students, whereas the e-book version allows for electronic word searches.

**Columbia Global Reports**: _Ghosting the news: local journalism and the crisis of American democracy_, by Margaret Sullivan (2020, 105 pp, $15.99 pbk, $9.99 ebook). Rev. by Mark Feldstein, _Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly_, **99**(1).

The monograph lacks an index or bibliography, and its endnotes are sketchy.

**Kokelaar, Peter** (author, kokelaargower.com): _All our own water: landscape evolution, caves and hydrogeology of Gower_ (2021, 282 pp, £20). Rev. by Brian S. John, _The Holocene_, 2022, **32**(4).

There are several appendices, including a reference list; but there is no index apart from a list of placenames. Finally, mention must be made of the book’s appearance and layout. The illustrations are generally superb, but the book design is frankly chaotic … Overall, this is an unusual book, well worth £20 of anybody’s money because of the abundant information it contains but spoiled (for this reader at least) by a lack of balance and by a lack of editorial control.

**Peabody Essex Museum**: _The furniture masterworks of John and Thomas Seymour_, by Robert D. Mussey Jr (2003, xiv + 462 pp, $65). Rev. by Philip Zea, _American Furniture_, 2005.

On the practical side, it is problematic that an index to the book was not included.

**Royal Irish Academy (RIA)**: _Climate and society in Ireland_, ed. by James Kelly and Tomás Ó Carragáin (2021, 456 pp, €35, £30). Rev. by Peter Coxon, _The Holocene_, 1 March 2022.

The book is actually a themed issue of the RIA’s Proceedings Section C (Archaeology, Culture, History, Literature) and as such is not widely cross-referenced nor indexed.

**Thames & Hudson**: _An Egyptian bestiary_, by Philippe Germond (2001, 224 pp, £41.54). Rev. by Anne Boston, _Slightly Foxed_, 73, Spring 2022.

Beside the magnificent photographs, the translated academic text, dense with deciphering the multi-layered imagery, assumes the reader knows more than a novice like me, while the lack of an index (regrettably normal in French publishing) and list of illustrations are drawbacks.

**Yale University Art Gallery**: _Manuel Neri: the human figure in plaster and on paper_, by Jock Reynolds (2018). Rev. by Margaret Nicholson, S_culptureview_, (?)

This book could use an index, but those seeking to be informed about his work in bronze or marble should look elsewhere.

By the way …

**Constable**: _Terence: the man who invented design_, by Stephen Bayley and Roger Mavity (2021, 328 pp, £25). Rev. by John Walsh, _Sunday Times_, n.d. (review quoted in _The Oldie_, Winter 2021).

The authors are well placed to identify Conran’s salient features, good and bad. In the index, entries include ‘ambitious’, ‘bully’, ‘callous’, ‘capricious’, ‘charming’, ‘childlike’, ‘competitive’, ‘controlling nature’ and ‘cruelty’; and later ‘psychopathic trait’, ‘rude’, ‘self-love’, superior’, ‘tyrannical’, ‘unpredictable’ and ‘untrustworthy’.

**Da Capo Press**: _The great good place: cafes, coffee shops, bookstores, bars, hair salons, and other hangouts at the heart of a community_, by Ray Oldenburg (3rd edn, 1999, 384 pp, £13.19 pbk). Rev. by J. K. Elmborg, ‘Libraries as the spaces between us: recognizing and valuing the third space’, _Reference & User Services Quarterly_, **50**(4).

Interestingly (and tellingly) the index to _The Great Good Place_ lists fifteen entries for tavern, nineteen entries for coffee houses, but no entries for libraries.

**Routledge**: (2021). _The Routledge reviewer’s guide to mixed methods analysis_, ed. by A. J. Onwuegbuzie and R. B. Johnson (2021, 387 pp, $59 pbk). Rev. by Elizabeth G. Creamer, _Journal of Mixed Methods Research_, 2022, **16**(2).

The number of entries in the index suggest that readers in the health sciences and education are most likely to resonate with the text … This is not a volume that is likely to be read chapter by chapter. A more likely use of the volume is as a resource book to understand the ‘how to’ of analysis of the procedures described. Another way to mine the benefits of the volume is turn to the index where a reader can choose, as I did, to follow the trail of what is said across chapters about a topic of interest. For me these topics were visual displays and theory. Each chapter can stand alone as it is not dependent on language or terminology introduced earlier in the volume.

**Yale University Press**: _The buildings of England: Birmingham and the Black Country_, by Andy Foster, Nikolaus Pevsner and Alexandra Wedgwood (2021, 968 pp, £45). Rev. by Jonathan Meades, _The Oldie_, April 2022.

These \[Birmingham\] artists were outsiders – not part of the web of local practitioners who, decade after decade, have questionably enjoyed the bulk of municipal and commercial patronage … Foster’s complicated index indicates just how tight that web was – and perhaps still is. There are 60 entries for the ecclesiastical architect W H Bidlake; 50 for the predominantly domestic architect C E Bateman; 40 for Fred Beck; 80 for J A Chatwin; 40 for P B Chatwin; 50 for J H Chamberlain (no relation, though he did fine work for his namesake).

Revenge of the mad indexer?

Margalit Fox’s review of Dennis Duncan’s _Index, A History of the_ (Feb. 27) reminded me of an entry in the index for William Kennedy’s _O Albany!_ When it came out, I looked to see if my great-grandfather’s ice house was listed under the W’s. It wasn’t – but I was amused to see a nearby entry for ‘vote fraud’ where, rather than provide the page numbers, the indexer indicated, ‘see Democratic Party.’ I’d never thought that an indexer could both editorialize and entertain.

While the index includes entries for ‘Prohibition,’ ‘prostitution’ and ‘Mafia, the,’ there isn’t one for ‘speakeasy,’ even though my grandfather worked at such a ‘gentlemen’s club’ across the street from the State Legislature; so under this category, the indexer could have indicated, ‘see New York State Capitol.’

I was a resident physician in obstetrics and gynecology from 1982 to 1986. The authoritative text at that time was a 1,179 page tome: _Williams Obstetrics, 16th Edition_ (1980). We were expected to know every bit of it. The authors were faculty at the renowned Parkland Hospital in Dallas. In perusing the index late one night, one of my colleagues came upon the following entry: ‘Chauvinism, male, voluminous amount 1–1,102.’ We also discovered ‘Eyes, of Texas are upon you, 1–1,102.’ We all loved this commentary and came to refer to it as the revenge of the mad indexer. Were the indexer and proofreader in collusion?

Dave’s index

8 September 2019

No sooner have they sat down than they are racing through the index of Dave’s book to see how many entries they have, which is virtually none, but Greg \[Barker, MP\] is smug because he has four compared to Hugo’s three.

A wonderful exchange with Mark Francois in the Members’ tearoom.

‘Have you read David Cameron’s book, Mark?’ a remainer MP asks.

‘I looked up F in the index and couldn’t find my name, so I didn’t buy it.’

‘Did you try looking under C?’
