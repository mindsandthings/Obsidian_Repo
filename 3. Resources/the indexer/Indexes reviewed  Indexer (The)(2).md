Publication: The Indexer: The International Journal of Indexing

Volume 39, Number 2

These extracts from reviews do not pretend to represent a complete survey of all reviews in journals and newspapers. We offer only a selection from quotations that readers have sent in. Our reproduction of comments is not a stamp of approval from _The Indexer_ upon the reviewer’s assessment of an index. Extracts are arranged alphabetically under the names of publishers, within the sections: Indexes praised; Two cheers!; Indexes censured; Indexes omitted.

## Indexes praised

**Academic Press/Elsevier:** _Information resources in toxicology_, ed. by Philip Wexler (2020, vol. 1 1054 pp, vol. 2 808 pp, _£_135 per vol., hard cover/ebook). Rev. by Robert W. Kapp Jr, _International Journal of Toxicology_, 1–3.

Volume 1 has a generous 134-page index which is referenced and cross-referenced and is very handy in seeking specific information should you have the print copy … The second volume also has an 80-page index which is quite useful and covers just about everything a toxicologist needs to know in international regulations.

With such a massive amount of information contained in one place, I found searching for specifics remarkably effective using the digital version. Of course, the print version has over 200 pages of excellent indices if one does not mind physically handling the volumes that collectively weigh 12.1 lbs/5.5 kg.

**Bodley Head**: _Himalaya: a human history_, by Ed Douglas (2020, 592 pp, £25). Rev. by John Keay, _Times Literary Supplement_, 13 November 2020.

Scholars may regret the absence of source notes in such a major work … But the thirty-page index is some help in navigating the always authoritative text, and this is certainly not a book to be dismissed lightly.

**Mohr Siebeck**: _Geboren, um zu herrschen: Gefährdete Dynastien in historisch-interdisziplinärer Perspektive_, ed. by Ellen Widder, Iris Holzwart-Schäfer and Christian Heinemeyer (2018, viii + 307 pp, €59). Rev. by Cathleen Sarti, _Royal Studies Journal_ **6**(2), 2019.

As a last point, I want to congratulate the editors for a book in which I did not spot a typo or anything else which might have distracted the flow of reading. Furthermore, the extensive and very helpful index is worth a mention, too.

\[_Index by DNI member Jochen Fassbender_.\]

**John Murray**: _Burning the books: a history of knowledge under attack_, by Richard Ovenden (2020, 308 pp, _£_20). Rev. by Charles Oppenheim, _Journal of Librarianship and Information Science_, 1–2.

The book’s index gives you a flavour of just how broad it is; five consecutive index entries are Ethiopia, looting; Euclid; European Union; Evesham Abbey library; and Facebook.

**Simon & Schuster**: _The farther corner: a sentimental return to north-east football_, by Harry Pearson (2020, 336 pp, _£_16.99). Rev. by Huw Richards, _The Guardian_, 28 November 2020.

The index is a joy in itself. \[It’s not often that can be said about a book on football.\]

## Indexes censured

**Bloomsbury Academic**: _Peasants in Russia from serfdom to Stalin: accommodation, survival, resistance_, by Boris B. Gorshkov (2018, 256 pp, _£_90 hbk, _£_28.99 pbk, _£_26.09 ebook). Rev. by Anthony W. Johnson, _European History Quarterly_, **50**(4).

Gorshkov allowed errors to creep in elsewhere (such as noting on one page that the average peasant family’s plot was nineteen acres while in a later chapter indicating that the average plot was thirty-nine acres, misspellings and grammatical errors in the footnotes, and even index terms with the incorrect page numbers). These kinds of lapses are problematic.

**Cambridge University Press**: _The Dutch in the early modern world: a history of a global power_, by David Onnekink and Gijs Rommelse (2019, 314 pp, _£_74.99/_£_22.99). Rev. by Joris van den Tol, _European History Quarterly_, **50**(4).

Furthermore, students interested in certain topics, such as slavery (pages 131–6 and 267–76 especially), will have to read the entire book because the index is silent on slavery, enslavement, forced migration or the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Transylvania, by contrast, can be found in the index, despite its limited importance for the wider book or Dutch history.

**Cape**: _Red comet: the short life and blazing art of Sylvia Plath_, by Heather Clark (2020, 1152 pp, _£_30). Rev. by Ann Kennedy Smith, _Times Literary Supplement_, 13 November 2020.

I spotted only minor errors: no index reference to Plath’s villanelle ‘Mad Girl’s Love Song’ (1953), and the cover photograph was taken by the Cambridge photographer Lettice Ramsey in 1956, not 1957.

**Fontaine Uitgevers:** _Flavour_, by Yotam Ottolenghi and Ixta Belfrage (2020, 320 pp, €32. Rev. by Martine Kamsma, _NRC-Handelsblad_, 31 October, 1 November 2020.

Meanwhile she leaves through the index of Ottolenghi’s _Flavour_ – without a good index you are lost as a reader. ‘Oh, black lime on page 18, but it is actually on page 20,’ she sees all of a sudden. And it is listed under ‘B’, not under ‘L’. She sighs a little. ‘That always seems to happen to me.’

\[_Translated by Caroline Diepeveen, who contributed this extract referring to the Dutch edition of_ Flavour. _In this article, the writer is interviewing Jonah Freud, a bookshop owner in Amsterdam_.\]

**Head of Zeus**: _Money for nothing: the South Sea Bubble and the invention of modern capitalism_, by Thomas Levenson (2020, 480 pp, _£_20). Rev. by Rebecca L. Spang, _Times Literary Supplement_, 15 January 2021.

Levenson and his publisher surely planned this book for the 300th anniversary of the South Sea Bubble; they cannot have intended for it to coincide with a global pandemic. Yet while the word ‘plague’ does not figure in the book’s subtitle or even index, the phenomenon recurs repeatedly in the text: it occasions Newton’s retreat to Lincolnshire and prompts special interest in mortality figures (from which William Petty and Edmond Halley calculate life expectancies and develop early actuarial tables).

**Institutum Historiciam Societatis Iesu:** _The Jesuit Irish mission: A calendar of correspondence, 1566–1752_, ed. by Vera Moynes (2017, 692 pp, €60). Rev. by James Kelly, _Irish Economic and Social History_, **47**(1).

Moreover, the inclusion in the volume, as appendices, of a list of superiors general, vicars general, superiors of the Irish mission, and a listing of 291 Jesuits involved on the Irish mission (appendix four) is also helpful.

The failure to embrace a more thematic approach to the index may, by comparison, be seen as something of a missed opportunity. It does contain an entry on the presence of plague in 1603 and 1650, for example, and on the Irish language but it omits print and other issues and themes as a consequence of its prioritisation of people and places.

This is a pity. But it is not a significant criticism of the edition or the editor, and still less of Brian Mac Cuarta, the director of ARSI, with whom ‘the idea of this calendar originated’ (p. x).

**Princeton University Press**: _The poet’s mistake_, by Erica McAlpine (2020, 164 pp, $99.95/$29.95). Rev. by Graeme Richardson, _Times Literary Supplement_, 1 January 2021.

McAlpine … looks at fortunate errors (Auden’s ‘the poets have names for the sea’ becoming ‘the ports’), John Ashbery’s malapropisms, justified by his use of the ‘spoken’ language in his poems, and the wilful writing-by-errata of Paul Muldoon. (It should be noted here that leaving Ashbery unmentioned in the index is a very Ashberian move.)

**Routledge**: _Early modern Ireland: new sources, methods, and perspectives_, ed. by Sarah Covington, Vincent P. Carey and Valerie McGowan-Doyle (2019, 371 pp, _£_34.99). Rev. by Bernadette Cunningham, _Irish Economic and Social History_, **47**(1).

At times, there is a sense of participating in some lively après-ski discussions on the fringes of a conference rather than hearing the formal presentation of research results. Unfortunately, that intermittent casualness also pervades the seemingly hurried editing, not stopping to notice that there is no such series as the _New Oxford History_ repeatedly mentioned in chapter one, or to check the spelling of the names of authors cited … The index is similarly casual. It has all the appearance of a stream of consciousness methodology, with no apparent thought given to the usefulness of the headwords chosen. Among the oddities are ‘canonical invasions of Ireland’; ‘close reading bardic poetry’; ‘conformity: emotions’; ‘earl of Essex: disobedience’; ‘layouts: households’; ‘loans: spatial patterns of reporting violence’; ‘McCann, May: ploughing the tail’ \[_sic_\]; ‘oldest-known map of Ireland auction’; ‘O’Toole, Fintan: Down Survey intent’. The index is systematically peculiar and does not do justice to an interesting set of essays designed to stimulate debate.

## Indexes omitted

**Oxbow Press**: _The earliest Europeans, a year in the life: seasonal survival strategies in the Lower Palaeolithic_, by Robert Hosfield (2020, 416 pp, _£_24.99). Rev. by Robert C. Power, _Antiquity_, 17 February 2021.

Despite the overall strong format, a detailed list of figures and feature box topics would be useful to the reader, as would an index.

## By the way …

**Allen & Unwin**: _Words that go ‘ping’: the ridiculously wonderful world of onomatopoeia_, by Barbara Lasserre (2018, 197 pp, $16.95). Rev. by Marilyn Lewis, _RELC Journal_ **51**(3).

Initially I had thought of recommending an index for any future edition but after reading all the contents I decided that would be impossible. The dozens of points, anecdotes and examples are so interwoven that trying to identify every appearance of, say, words of emotion, would be like trying to write an index for a jigsaw.

**Doubleday**: _Written in bone: hidden stories in what we leave behind_, by Sue Black (2020, 359 pp, _£_18.99). Rev. by Gavin Francis, _London Review of Books_, 21 January 2020.

Ian Hamilton once recounted in the _LRB_ (22 October 1992) that ‘when William F. Buckley Jr sent a copy of his essays to Norman Mailer, he pencilled a welcoming “Hi, Norman!” in the index, next to Mailer’s name.’ The index discloses a lot about the nature of a book, and the passions of its author, more than is sometimes realised (‘acknowledgments’ are similarly illuminating). And as a reader, what you look for in the index reveals something about you, maybe even something you didn’t particularly wish to know.

The entries under ‘S’ in the index of Sue Black’s new book, _Written in Bone_, include ‘Stevanin, Gianfranco, Monster of Terrazzo’ (seven page mentions); ‘stillborn babies’ (six); ‘strangulation’ (six); and ‘strappado’ (two). In the section for ‘D’ I found the sequence ‘diploic bone’ (five); ‘disaster victim identification’ (two); ‘disfigurement’ (two); ‘dismemberment’ (fifteen). Those fifteen page mentions reflect Black’s special interest in dismemberment, though she claims no particular skill at dividing limb from limb: ‘The inexperienced dismemberer, and let’s face it most of us are, will probably attempt first to cut through the long bones. If they do, they will very swiftly find that this is an extremely difficult task. It requires the right tools, plenty of time, a suitable location and a good deal of stamina.’ The entry following ‘dismemberment’ is ‘Disney’ …

Her stories invite us to imagine the worst that can happen to us, or those we love. But I was also reminded of a pathologist who, on completing her autopsies, would pull off her gloves with a snap and announce: ‘Isn’t it good to be alive.’ There’s redemption here, too, and justice; there’s humanitarianism and compassion. Just don’t expect to find them in the index.

**Yale**: _Take arms against a sea of troubles: the power of the reader’s mind over a universe of death_, by Harold Bloom (2020, 672 pp, _£_25). Rev. by Philip Hensher, _The Spectator_, 21 November 2020.

_Take Arms Against a Sea of Troubles_ is rather curiously named; that’s Hamlet’s phrase for suicide, after which your career as a reader is usually over. It consists of 16 chapters about 19 dead white men. The title is not much of a guide to any over-arching argument. The indexer, who must have been challenged, has had his or her revenge: ‘Bloom, Harold’ occupies the longest entry, three full columns.

## An apology

I’m grateful and I’m sorry to every journalist who immediately searched for their name in the index but only found it in the source list.

## Not found

It’s the birthday of poet and artist William Blake … born in London (1757). He was four years old when he had a vision that God was at his window. A few years later, he went for a walk and saw a tree filled with angels, their wings shining. He had other visions, too: he saw the prophet Ezekiel sitting under a tree, and angels walking with farmers making hay.

When Blake was 10 his parents sent him to drawing school, and at the age of 14 he was apprenticed to an engraver. After seven years, he went into business for himself, and a few years later he privately printed his first book, _Poetical Sketches_ (1783). It was a total flop – it wasn’t even mentioned in the index of London’s _Monthly Review_, a list of every book published that month.

## Lives of Greene

Where \[Norman\] Sherry was reverent \[_The life of Graham Greene_ (Cape, 1989)\], Michael Shelden’s unauthorized biography \[_Graham Greene: the man within_ (Heinemann, 1994)\] seemed to be written with a grudge. Sniffing out – convincingly, for the most part – period antisemitism and a more personal fascination with violence to women, the sheer sordidness of Shelden’s approach became perversely entertaining, as he scrutinized his morally rotten subject’s tendencies towards not just ‘cruelty’, ‘hatred’, ‘deviousness’ and ‘subversiveness’, but ‘anal sex’, ‘flagellation’, ‘masochism, including cigarette burns’, ‘paedophilia’, ‘young girls’ and ‘possible actual homosexuality’ (all duly indexed).
