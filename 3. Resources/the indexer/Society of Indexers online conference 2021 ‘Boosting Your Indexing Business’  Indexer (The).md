## Abstract

The Society of Indexers’ first online conference featured a mixture of concrete and more conceptual presentations, from practical tips to help indexers improve their business and indexing practice to indexing the metatopic and a keynote presentation by Dennis Duncan and Paula Clarke Bain on 2021’s indexing book of the year (_Index, a history of the_). This report, compiled by one of the conference organizers, incorporates the views of conference participants with varying lengths of indexing experience, from student indexer to advanced professional, all of whom found it both enjoyable and informative.

The Society of Indexers (SI) ventured into the online conference world with a two-day event on 9–10 November 2021, using the Zoom platform that has become ubiquitous since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. With over 70 participants on the first day (including several from North America as well as the UK and continental Europe), this was the final indexing conference of the year.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.7#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> Around half of the participants were seasoned indexers with ten or more years’ experience, while around a third were relative newcomers. The conference programme therefore had to cater for widely differing interests and levels of experience, but judging from the post-conference feedback survey, and enthusiastic comments in the Zoom chat, the event was a resounding success.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.7#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> Incorporating some results from the feedback survey, this report mainly reflects the views of seven conference participants with varying lengths of indexing experience (from student indexer to advanced professional), three of whom were attending a conference for the first time, and two of whom had been SI members for less than a year.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.7#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup>

From the new indexer perspective, Susie Marques-Jones summed up the conference in this way:

> This was a welcome opportunity to get together, improve indexing skills and, for us newer members of the SI, to finally put names to faces. There were also familiar faces from international indexers that I recognised from the earlier conferences, and this highlighted the close-knit indexing community vibe from around the world … What has stood out for me from my experience of the indexing world so far is how welcoming and generous with their time professional indexers are towards students – a real welcoming into the fold – and this was also apparent in the conference.

This was echoed by fellow student indexer Julia Smith:

> I recognised many of the names, but had never been able to put faces to those names until now. Both the SIdeline and student forums are such welcoming communities, and this friendly environment certainly extended to the virtual conference … ‘meeting’ my fellow indexers, even virtually, enabled me to feel much more connected to the professional indexing community.

For long-time indexer Christine Boylan it was an equally worthwhile experience:

> Twenty-eight years an indexer, even longer a Society member, and I had never attended an SI conference … Given the opportunity to attend from the comfort of my own home, I could hardly refuse and what a wonderful time it was. So lovely to put faces to names and meet with colleagues from different disciplines. With varied sessions there was something for everyone, whatever their level of experience.

For Nicola Green, ‘the format seemed reassuringly familiar to the 2017 and 2019 SI conferences that I attended’, while Joanna Penning was ‘keen to participate in the conference this year, having felt the deprivations that we have all experienced during the pandemic era’. And as Linda Haylock said, ‘it drastically cut the expense of attending a face-to-face conference … and the sessions were just as informative and useful as they always have been. Nothing was lost (apart from the Conference dinner) from this experience, but much gained.’

## _Index, a history of the_ (Dennis Duncan and Paula Clarke Bain)

The conference opened with a warm welcome from SI chair Nicola King and honorary president Sam Leith. ‘We were all impressed with Sam’s manner of formal attire … \[and\] he summed up the lot of indexers by describing us as “working in scholarly solitude” … almost Dickensian’ (Linda Haylock). (For a screenshot of Sam and other images, see the Wakelet report of the real-time comments that were being posted on Twitter as events unfolded, which gives an alternative and entertaining perspective on the conference.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.7#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup>)

The conference proper ‘kicked off to a cracking start with the keynote presentation by double act Dennis Duncan and Paula Clarke Bain … \[which\] showed that there is no match for real-life human indexers who give an index its “personality”’ (Susie Marques-Jones). It ‘gave me a sense of the buzz surrounding the book’s success and its contribution to the indexing profession’ (Nicola Green). Describing them as the indexing world’s new celebrities, Julia Smith ‘loved hearing about the different layers of “meta-ness” in indexing a book about indexing’. In addition to finding it both fascinating and engaging, it also struck a chord with her as a student indexer:

> Firstly, Dennis Duncan mentioned his ‘Imaginary Reader’ who sits on his shoulder as he writes, which made me realise that I need my own ‘Imaginary Index User’ who can sit on my shoulder and point out my unsought terms and vague subheadings. Hearing about Paula’s process of indexing this book, her collaboration with Dennis, and how this author collaboration differs from her usual work, was also a helpful insight into the working practices of professional indexers.

Linda Haylock was grateful to Dennis ‘for turning indexers “cool” and Paula for being our stand-out indexing beacon’.

> Dennis chatted to us about the background to research writing, and the inspirations behind his book ‘_Index, A History of the_’. These include novels with an index, the Oulipo (a French avant-garde literary group, and their approach to narrative), a realisation that the history of indexing hadn’t really been done before, as well as strong book press interest. All conglomerated into a decision to take the task on himself.
> 
> The author–indexer contact began at an indexing conference … (drinks at the pub were mentioned) … \[and\] the reasons he chose Paula to index the book were that he felt she would be a good fit for the book, having read her blog on comedy book indexes; as well as the fact that she had ‘status’ within the Society of Indexers.
> 
> Paula herself said the index had been challenging. She was very aware that accomplished and experienced indexers would be scrutinizing her index. The pressure was on! She also wanted to reflect the dual nature of the text – scholarly and trade; serious and silly; wit and wisdom. Crosswords, acrostics, anagrams were alluded to, circular cross-references were included, automated/computer indexes were snarked about. Paula was given pretty much licence ‘to play’ and did so, pulling off an amazing index (while most of us were secretly thinking ‘no way would I have been able to do that!’).
> 
> We are all looking forward (or not) to seeing the forthcoming ‘very yellow’ US book cover, smug in the knowledge that the UK cover is medievally delightful, or delightfully medieval. (Linda Haylock)

## Software sessions: working smarter

The first day included sessions on ‘working smarter’ with four software packages (CINDEX, SKY Index, Index-Manager and IndexExploit). Although primarily aimed at those already using the packages, they enabled indexing students to get a taster of the different options available. The conference feedback survey showed that all four sessions were well received, with Index-Manager and SKY Index singled out for particular comment by our reporters. It seems that the online format is more successful at delivering software training than might initially have been expected, with the Zoom chat facilitating the exchange of additional tips and tricks as well as questions for the presenters. ‘The pre-conference information was useful here as we could work through the worksheets, along with free downloads of the software before the conference’ (Susie Marques-Jones). To make the most of this ‘blended-learning’ approach, it was important to have the time to do this preparatory work.

> The session on Index-Manager looked promising, but I had had very little time to peruse the pre-conference document and had not managed to download the trial version. I was immediately perplexed by the complex IM interface … \[and\] felt that this session was not working for me at all … A later session … on SKY Index … felt immediately well within my grasp … Features that are new to me, or at least that I have not fully explored, were demonstrated and explained by Tanya \[Izzard\]. This was coherently structured and it has meant that I have gone away and started creating a ‘play’ index where I can explore \[them\]. (Joanna Penning)
> 
> The two software sessions that I attended, Index-Manager and SKY Index, were examples where online worked really well as I could clearly hear the speakers and see the screens being shared. I was very much dipping my toe in the water by joining the Index-Manager session. Tanya Izzard’s demonstration using Sky 8, and her handout sent by email before the event, was worth the price of the conference alone. She gave us lots of tips on how to index more efficiently. (Nicola Green)
> 
> Both sessions taught me ‘tricks’ to increase indexing efficiency. Judging from the comments in the chat, there was also plenty to learn here for the experienced software users, showing that we never stop learning (and inspiring me to actually spend more time in the future reading the manuals!) (Susie Marques-Jones)

## Q&A panel session

Halfway through the software sessions, a break for a Q&A panel session enabled five experienced indexers, under the chairmanship of retiring SI training director Ann Hudson, to discuss their indexing methods in relation to a series of questions and scenarios.

> One thing that Paula \[had\] mentioned was that she looks back at her marvellous index and thinks about what she could have done differently. This also came up in the Q&A session later, as several experienced indexers mentioned that they don’t think their finished indexes are perfect. I thought this was only a student problem! This session gave me an appreciation of the realities of working in the indexing profession, and a greater understanding of not only the issues I might face when qualified, but also the different approaches I might take to overcome these. Every job, of course, has its challenges; the way that professional indexers come together to discuss these challenges in an open and constructive manner was encouraging to me as a student. (Julia Smith)

Christine Boylan found the session ‘very interesting’ and thanked the panel members ‘for taking on some challenging questions and exposing themselves to public scrutiny with their answers and without resorting to the “it depends” answer on too many occasions’. The following issues were discussed:

•

indexing terms provided by the author

•

choice of Microsoft Office package

•

with tight deadlines, is putting an index aside for a day before the final read-through a luxury we can no longer afford?

•

handling a delayed project when the deadline cannot be extended

As with other sessions, suggestions and comments in the Zoom chat augmented the panel discussion.

## Getting started: finding work (Nicola King) and using social media (Ruth Ellis)

> This whistle-stop session … crammed plenty of tips and advice for better marketing, specialisation as an indexer and finding clients, both for the ‘newbies’ and experienced members, too. (Susie Marques-Jones)
> 
> Having attended similar presentations at previous conferences, it was helpful to get up-to-date perspectives on the current situation. The importance of building up your networks was stressed and made me wonder who I might have met and mingled with if we had all been together in the same place. (Nicola Green)
> 
> The business side of freelancing – advertising yourself, finding clients, invoicing, getting paid – is the part of indexing I felt least prepared for, at least I did until this conference. I now have a clear strategy for starting my own business and making contacts in the publishing world, and the solidly practical advice given in this session will be invaluable in the future. (Julia Smith)

Although primarily aimed at students in the final stages of the training course and newly qualified indexers looking for their first projects, experienced indexers also found this first session of Day Two of value. As at least one participant noted in the Zoom chat, marketing one’s indexing services and finding new clients are things that continue even after one is established.

Having completed her training 12 years earlier, Linda Haylock was pleased to learn that ‘letter-writing has been knocked on the head. Such a waste of time and postage costs!’ Today, ‘thanks to improved technology and social media, we can don our detective caps and embrace our Inner Spy, as we have fun tracking down those elusive important contacts’. As the SI Internet director and social media manager, Ruth Ellis’s advice included how to use the various social media platforms effectively, and various strategies were suggested for finding the contact details of anyone involved in one’s field of interest. There were also words of caution: ‘Twitter mentions and posts can sometimes be pulled up by Google searches \[and\] don’t over-share personal opinions on political, or other matters, on Facebook. You might find yourself clashing with somebody you want to impress’ (Linda Haylock).

Other useful tips mentioned by the presenters and augmented by many contributions in the chat included keeping one’s professional directory entry up to date, creating and maintaining a website, maintaining a CV and/or providing links to LinkedIn or a directory entry, asking to be placed on a publisher’s list of potential indexers, using as an example index the one prepared for the training course practical indexing assignment and joining potentially useful interest groups on Facebook and other social media sites. The session also touched on client relations, including the information and material that potential clients might send, setting up an enquiry sheet with all the questions to ask the client, the value of sending the SI Christmas cards and to what extent the indexer should point out errors and inconsistencies in the text.

## Breakout rooms

A short networking breakout session was scheduled for the first day of the conference (between the CINDEX and SKY Index presentations), with participants randomly allocated to breakout rooms. On the second day, the ‘getting started’ presentation was followed by a substantial hour-long session with topic-based breakout rooms (covering biography, client relations, embedded indexing, MACREX and science and medicine). These generally worked well: ‘it was fun and informative to meet and discuss issues’ (Joanna Penning), and they ‘provided a better opportunity to chat with other indexers in a more intimate setting, although as a student indexer I was more a fly on the wall learning from the more advanced members’ (Susie Marques-Jones). Responses to the feedback survey indicated that the breakout sessions were generally thought to be about the right length, enabling useful discussion to take place. However,

> It would have been useful to have had more breakout sessions to network and more specialised topic areas to choose from in the topic-based rooms, like in the SCI/CSI conference, and hopefully this is something that could be built into any future SI virtual conferences. (Susie Marques-Jones)

Several comments in the post-conference feedback echoed this sentiment, and there was also a suggestion that it might have been helpful to have had a designated ‘leader’ or ‘moderator’ in each ‘room’ and more of a pre-planned agenda to coordinate the discussion, which sometimes felt rather unstructured. Indeed, one respondent confessed to having ‘probably dominated the discussion!’

## Financial matters: dealing with late payment (Sue Goodman)

Following the SI AGM and a lunch break, client relations were also the focus of this session, which derived from activity on the SI Information Exchange over the last year or so, much of which related to chasing late payments. It included a brief round-up of the legal position, together with helpful tips that members have found useful in the past. Newer indexers were reassured that despite forming the subtitle of this session, late payment is not an issue for much of the time. Nevertheless, it is something that freelancers do have to be prepared to deal with and various strategies were suggested. This was much more of an interactive session rather than a presentation, giving participants the chance to ask questions and contribute to the discussion, sharing their own experiences. Topics covered included sending ‘statements’ as a follow-up to unpaid invoices, up-front payments for large jobs or unknown self-publishing authors, getting payments from overseas clients and from universities, and the tendency of authors to pay more promptly than publishers.

## Indexing the metatopic (Melanie Gee)

In the pre-conference documentation, Melanie noted that ‘to mention the word “metatopic” is to strike fear into the hearts of many student indexers’. As a ‘metatopic muser’, she explained why the metatopic is important, how it might be indexed effectively as a main heading, and how it influences the rest of the index. Drawing not only from the published literature and her own reflections, she also included the practices of other indexers, as revealed by the results of a short survey she had carried out prior to the conference.

Susie Marques-Jones was not alone in feeling that this was a ‘strong finish’ to the conference. ‘Using an attractively laid out PowerPoint show, Mel got under the metatopic bonnet in a lively and engaging manner, therefore helping me to stay on board during the final presentation of the day’ (Nicola Green). For the experienced indexer, it was

> a thought-provoking session that had me looking back at my old SI training course books (1988/1989). This was from the time when ‘metatopic’ was not a thing and I could find nothing specific mentioned about this in the material. Somewhere in the training it must have been communicated that indexing the metatopic was not advisable and I still hold on to that idea while working. I have occasionally had authors requesting a main heading for the general topic of the book. I counter this by asking what they would like indexing under this heading, usually leading to them back-tracking, having realised that they don’t have a clear idea themselves but just think it should be in the index. Mel’s discussion had me rethinking my criteria, especially with the different examples, and thanks go to everyone who contributed these. My usual approach is to ignore it totally or use something akin to Mel’s ‘metatopic clusters’ approach, subdividing the topic into its own main entries … Congratulations to Mel for putting together all the information into a very entertaining and educational presentation. (Christine Boylan)

Things have moved on since the late 1980s and the SI training course does briefly touch on the metatopic: ‘it is helpful for students to be aware of the concept, especially when thinking about the structure and organisation of an index, \[but\] they are not expected to delve into it too deeply at this stage’ (Nicola Green). Indeed, Melanie warned of the danger of indexing the whole book under the one metatopic heading, a fault that student indexers are warned to avoid.

## Looking ahead: online, in person or hybrid?

> Overall, this was another great virtual indexing conference, and I enjoyed attending as a student member, and meeting other indexers while improving my indexing skills. Students were considered both in the programme and during the conference, with plenty of extra information in the sessions and Zoom chat section for newbies … Hopefully, there will be continued opportunities to attend online or hybrid SI conferences in the future, as well as face-to-face ones, so that everyone has the opportunity to attend. (Susie Marques-Jones)
> 
> By the end of the conference my mind was buzzing with new ideas, and I experienced the kind of mental exhaustion that follows all the best conferences. I’m now looking forward to putting everything I’ve learned into practice, and of course, looking forward to the 2022 SI conference! (Julia Smith)
> 
> Overall a very enjoyable and informative couple of days … incredible value for money and I do hope this format is repeated in the future. I look forward to being able to participate in some overseas conferences in a similar way. (Christine Boylan)

Judging by the success of this and the ASI and ISC/SCI events, online conferences are here to stay, as already suggested by [Kingdom (2021b](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.7#core-R3): 199): ‘There is no doubt that online events will become a permanent part of the mix of opportunities for professional development in a post-pandemic world … \[but\] they simply cannot replicate the interaction and networking that happens when indexers spend time together.’ The chance to ‘see’ other indexers (even if only on-screen) was rated as highly as the programme itself in attracting participants to the conference, according to respondents to the post-conference feedback survey, who frequently mentioned this as the best aspect of the conference. Over half the respondents rated the networking opportunities as good, and three-quarters felt that the advantages of the online format outweighed the disadvantages. Indeed, the vast majority felt that the Zoom chat added an extra dimension, with nearly two-thirds feeling that it actually enabled more comment and discussion than at face-to-face presentations. One respondent commented, ‘Despite being on Zoom, all sessions had a good “Conference” feel. I sometimes find the chat bit of Zoom distracting, but it did allow you to feel that you were part of an audience.’ As for the breakout rooms, one respondent described them as ‘heaven’:

> At face-to-face conferences, I find that people find their friends for lunch, breaks, etc., and if you’re not part of that group, you’re pretty much left out. I found myself with more confidence to speak during the breakout rooms as we were all pretty much in the same boat.

The Zoom platform certainly lends itself to conferences and similar events without requiring either extensive training or equipment. Despite some apprehension the day before, technical glitches were relatively minor (and dealt with efficiently) and even participants experiencing their first online event seemed comfortable with the technology, with everyone observing Zoom etiquette in a well-disciplined manner. For freelancers, the time and cost savings of online events, coupled with the convenience and minimal impact on other commitments, are significant advantages. However, a significant 60 per cent of respondents missed the opportunity for that important face-to-face, one-to-one networking.

Looking ahead, only 10 per cent expressed a preference for exclusively face-to-face events, with the majority (60 per cent) favouring a mixture of online and face-to-face, and a significant 20 per cent preferring online only. At the time of writing (December 2021), the international conference scheduled for October 2021 in Berlin is expected to be a hybrid event, with presentations live-streamed; 15 per cent of those completing the post-conference survey thought they were very likely to attend in person, with another 34 per cent anticipating that it was ‘quite likely’. We look forward to welcoming as many people as possible to this historic European city.

## Acknowledgements
