## Abstract

Through an analysis based primarily on British census returns from 1851 to 1911, supplemented by other online genealogical resources, the evolving use of the terms ‘index’ and ‘indexer’ in occupational descriptions is charted. Initially, the majority of entries related to watch, clock and gas meter index makers. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, ‘index clerks’ and others involved in putting things into alphabetical order became more prominent, with the first appearance of an identifiable book indexer in the census returns dating from 1881. Supplementing the existing literature on well-known pioneers of the profession, such as Henry B. Wheatley, the census returns and other sources consulted offer fascinating glimpses into the socio-economic status, family background and everyday lives of ‘ordinary’ indexers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the vast majority of whom were female and living in or near London.

## Introduction

When we think of indexers in the past we may know of the names of great indexers such as Henry B. Wheatley and we may have read of the pioneers described by [Hazel Bell (2008)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R2) in _From flock beds to professionalism._ But what of the ‘ordinary’ indexer, the person who earned their crust from indexing books or alphabetizing material in government departments or commercial enterprises? Online genealogical resources such as censuses, supplemented by other online resources, offer glimpses into the lives of these ordinary people in England, Wales and Scotland.

## Method

The research reported here uses England, Wales and Scotland census returns for 1851 to 1911 as they appeared on the FindMyPast website between December 2019 and April 2020. The 1921 returns are not due online until January 2022. It was felt that the gap between the 1911 census and 1939 Register is too large to cross at this time, so while individuals were cross-checked with the 1939 Register, no analysis of the Register is given in this paper.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup>

Searches were undertaken using the optional keyword ‘indexer’. This returned results from anywhere in the FindMyPast database, including the address. Every record with an original image was checked to confirm that the transcribed information was correct and to eliminate incorrect entries from further study. This procedure identified terms which had typically been confused in the (assumed to be) automatic transcription process. They did not occur in every census and some are discussed in the results below.

Names from this search were cross-referenced with other resources, including the newspapers and journals on FindMyPast, free material on the Ancestry website, general Google searches, Google books searches, and British Library searches.

‘Index’ is used in the censuses in many senses apart from book indexing and cataloguing of information. Makers of watch, clock, gas and water meter indexes were the most commonly retrieved occupations that included the word ‘index’ not in the publishing or alphabetizing senses before 1881. According to the _Oxford English Dictionary_,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> the ‘index’ of a clock or watch is what we would call today the ‘hand’, thus recalling the manicule or pointer sense of the word. The index of a gas or water meter may also have been a pointer but may have been the display or the gears that drove it. In modern gas meters the display is sometimes called the index and it can be circles with pointers or odometers with numbers.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup> Gears are used to drive the displays and there is a possibility that the gears in the meter mechanisms may have taken on a sense of ‘index’ because cyclists talk about ‘indexing’ their gears to ensure smooth transitions during gear changes.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup> The censuses also contain many ‘gas index takers’; perhaps we would call them meter readers today.

## Results

### 1851 to 1871 censuses

The majority of people who had the term ‘index’ or ‘indexer’ associated with their occupations were watch, clock and gas meter index makers. In 1851 there were 27, in 1861 there were 42 and in 1871 there were 11. Only William Blackall Wallington, an index clerk at the General Register Office, Somerset House, in 1851, can be associated with a role that included alphabetizing.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup> In the 1861 census he appeared as a general clerk and in 1871 as a superannuated civil service GRO index compiler, blind in the right eye. In 1881 he was described as a pensioner. Another individual, John Johnson, was a boat indexer, in Etruria, Stoke-on-Trent,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn6" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn6">6</a></sup> but it is not known what his role involved.

In the 1861 census material, the search returned several misattributed terms, including ‘under’, as in ‘under-gamekeeper’ or ‘under-gardener’; ‘independent’ used for people of independent means; and ‘India’ for people who were East India merchants, indicating some issues with the character recognition in the online material.

### 1881 census

In this census the use of the term ‘index’ showed a much greater range of use in roles requiring alphabetization. Altogether, 15 records include the term ‘index’ in this sense, as shown in [Table 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#T1).

In 1881 we therefore have indexers, all male, in the sense of putting things in alphabetical order, employed by the civil service, and in engineering, medicine, law and a freelance occupation, and one female who may have been a book indexer. Olga von Glehn seems to be the earliest-recorded book indexer in the British census returns.

[Valerie Langfield (2003)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R16) has researched the family von Glehn for their importance to music. Olga’s father, Robert, was an East India merchant, born in Russia (now Estonia) and naturalized in Britain in 1846.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn7" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn7">7</a></sup> He had 11 children, and by the 1851 census there were ten children at home, and a governess, two nurses, a cook and four house servants.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn8" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn8">8</a></sup> The house was a meeting place for artistic, literary and musical people, including Sir George Grove, Arthur Sullivan, Jenny Lind and J. R. Green.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn9" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn9">9</a></sup> Olga was close to Sir George Grove, head of the Royal College of Music, and was godmother to his son Arthur ([Langfield, 2003](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R16): 283). Olga appears in other censuses but is not recorded as indexing.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn10" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn10">10</a></sup> In 1871 she was the oldest daughter at home, but no occupation was recorded for any of the daughters. In the 1891 census, Olga was living in a cottage with two nieces and described as a language teacher. In 1901 she was living in a house in Sydenham Road, Lewisham, London, with one servant, and described as ‘Literary’, with ‘author’ added in pencil. In 1911 she was in Brockham, Surrey, living with her brother Oswald, an artist, and his wife and their daughter, and two servants, but no occupation was given. Olga’s other siblings included an engineer,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn11" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn11">11</a></sup> a bishop’s wife and supporter of women’s suffrage,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn12" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn12">12</a></sup> and a translator or author.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn13" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn13">13</a></sup> Other relatives included artists.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn14" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn14">14</a></sup> Olga died in 1918, aged 78.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn15" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn15">15</a></sup>

Valerie Langfield describes Olga as a music teacher, although it is not clear what the evidence was for this. As for her work as an indexer, although there may not be any definite evidence for any texts she worked on, [Langfield (2003](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R16): 283) claims she probably compiled the index for J. R. Green’s 1874 publication _A short history of the English people_, but Olga is not acknowledged in the printed volume.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn16" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn16">16</a></sup> Her friendship with Sir George Grove may have led to further links in the publishing world. Grove was the power behind _Grove’s dictionary of music and musicians;_ he worked for Macmillan editing a literary magazine and he authored books on geography, as well as working as a co-compiler of a biblical concordance.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn19" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn19">19</a></sup>

Looking at the people mentioned by [Hazel Bell (2008)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R2) in her history of index makers, we can see some of them in the 1881 and later censuses, but none are described as indexers.

•

Charlotte Yonge appears as an ‘Author of Novels’; before that she was a ‘Landed Proprietor’ and an ‘Author of Tales & Educational Works’. Her final appearance in 1891 was as an ‘Author’ and ‘Living on My Own Means’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn20" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn20">20</a></sup>

•

Henry Wheatley is described as ‘Asst. Sectr. Society of Arts’, a description that was also used in 1901, and in 1911 he was the ‘Pensioned Secretary of Society’. Previously he had been entered as a ‘Book Sellers Assistant’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn21" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn21">21</a></sup>

•

Sir Edward Cook appears as a ‘Student of Law’ in 1881, and thereafter as a ‘Journalist & Author’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn22" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn22">22</a></sup>

•

Beatrice Webb was described as an ‘Authoress’ and an ‘Author’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn23" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn23">23</a></sup>

### 1891 census

In the 1891 census we see Nancy Bailey, the pioneer indexer, for the first time, lodging at 31 Store Street, Bloomsbury, London, and described as ‘Literary (Indexing Hansards Parliamentary Papers)’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn24" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn24">24</a></sup> Bailey’s office was to be a short walk away in Keppel Street in 1892 ([Bell, 2008](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R2): 87) and in 1895 she had an office in Poets’ Corner, Old Palace Yard, according to the Post Office directory. By 1901 she had moved to Westminster Mansions, Great Smith Street,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn25" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn25">25</a></sup> closer to her offices in Great College Street and Little College Street ([Bell, 2008](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R2): 87; [Duncan, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R9)), and the Palace of Westminster. In the 1905 Post Office Directory she is the only entry under the category for indexer (page 2141). Some time after 1891, where her age is shown as 28, she also changed her date of birth from 1863 to 1871; in 1901 and 1911 her ages are given as 31 and 40 respectively. Nancy died on 25 January 1913.

Another indexer makes her first appearance in the 1891 census. Elizabeth (Eliza) Hetherington,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn26" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn26">26</a></sup> a teacher in Penrith, Cumberland, in 1881, was living in Shaftesbury Road, Hammersmith, London, in 1891, and described as an ‘Indexer of Periodicals and Books’; in 1901, she was indexing _Hansards Parliamentary Papers_, and by 1911 indexing literary work. Like Bailey, Hetherington was an indexer known to W. T. Stead, for whom she co-edited and compiled his _Index to Periodical Literature_.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn27" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn27">27</a></sup> Her 1892 article on absurd index entries was quoted by [Wheatley (1902](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R20): 59–60) on the subject of bad journal indexing. Elizabeth died in 1937, aged 82, in Hammersmith.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn28" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn28">28</a></sup>

These are the only two individuals whose work can definitely be identified as book indexing. Other people seem to have worked in book production or the publishing trade and the term ‘indexer’ is used in their description of employment.

•

Three young women from Glasgow are identified as ‘Book Indexers’: Flora Small (age 15), Jane Bell (age 19) and Barbara Gray (age 23).

•

Two young women from Scotland are identified as ‘Bible Indexers’: Mary McSween (age 18) and Agnes Paterson (age 15). Further ‘Bible Indexers’ appear in 1911 in London (see below). Did these young women cut thumb index tabs so that readers could easily find the sections they wanted?

•

Two people seemed to work at producing books with cut tabs in alphabetical order. Francis Creber (age 18) from Deptford, London, was an ‘Index Cutter’ and James Graham (age 69) from Bradford was a ‘Ledger Index Maker’.

•

Two people shared the title ‘Printer Indexer/Indexer Printer’. John Brooker (age 63) living in West Ham, London, was a ‘Printer Indexer’. In 1881 he had been a ‘Corrector of Press’, and in 1901 he remained a ‘Printer Indexer’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn29" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn29">29</a></sup> Emma Chamberlain (age 20), from Coventry, was an ‘Index Printer’; in 1901 she was a ‘Book Pager’, and in 1911 a shop assistant.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn30" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn30">30</a></sup> A third person, Richard Pritchard (age 17) in Manchester, was a ‘Printers Index Maker’,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn31" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn31">31</a></sup> and in 1901 he was a ‘Gas Index Maker’, so perhaps he was making dials or other counting machinery. Were these people all involved with counting the output of mechanized presses?

As in 1881, there are civil servants whose work must have entailed filing and cataloguing, and index clerks working in business, one of whom was a woman ([Table 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#T2)).

Table 2. Index clerks and other civil servants in similar jobs, 1891

| Place of work | Job title | People |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Register Office? | Index Clerk | Frederick Hall (aged 51). In 1901 he was Search Clerk and Deputy Registrar in the West Riding of Yorkshire Registry of Deeds. |
| Chancery Office | Index Clerk | James McQueen (aged 32) in Edinburgh. |
| Patent Office | Indexer of Patents | George Nower (age 28) in Hawarden, Wales; in later censuses he was a Schoolmaster and Head Teacher. |
|   | Index Clerk | Henry Hetcher (age 30) in Derby.  
Samuel Massey (age 32) in Stoke-on-Trent; later censuses indicate canal-boat-related indexing.  
George Honeyball (age 18) in Lambeth, London, at a stationers.  
Kate Sindall (age 23) in Salford; her sister was a forewoman at a printers. |

### 1901 census

Nancy Bailey started her indexing office in 1892, and by 1902 had trained around 70 women to be professional indexers ([Duncan, 2020)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R9). It was hoped that the effects of her training, and that of Mary Petherbridge, might be seen in the census entries. The following paragraphs describe people whose 1901 census entries include the term ‘indexer’ and whose work either definitely or probably included book indexing or a related activity. Other people who were described as indexers, including those working for local authorities and other employers, are listed in [Table 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#T3). The occupational descriptions for 68 people included the term ‘index’ in some form in 1901.

Table 3. Indexers in the 1901 census

| Job title and place of work (if stated) | People |
| --- | --- |
| Indexer, Royal College of Arms | Clara Austin (age 25) at 25 Drayton Gardens, Kensington, a boarding house. |
| Literary Clerk Research Indexing | Alice Phoebe Birch (age 28) in Langley Mansions, Lambeth. She was the daughter of an ‘office keeper’. In 1911 she appeared as ‘Manageress of Order & Card Index Department’ at a ladies’ tailors. |
| Journalist’s Indexer | Elizabeth Ellen Jones (age 43) at 31 Prince of Wales Road, Battersea, London. Brother Francis Arthur and sister Elaine Mary both described as journalists. In 1891 census both Elizabeth and Elaine were governesses. Francis Arthur Jones had a career as a music writer, producing a book about famous hymns, and as a journalist for _The Strand Magazine._<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn61" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn61">61</a></sup> He later moved to America and wrote a biography of Thomas Edison. In the 1911 census the sisters were living with their mother at 32 Lupus Street, Pimlico, Elaine an author, Elizabeth not working. All seem to have lost about ten years from their actual ages. Elaine was the author E. M. Jameson who published novels, children’s stories in the _Strand Magazine_ and the _Windsor Magazine_, and poems which were set to music as hymns. Elizabeth and Elaine both died after being hit by a car in January 1918.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn62" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn62">62</a></sup> Elizabeth died in the collision and Elaine died later.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn63" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn63">63</a></sup> The sisters had been on war work at Lady Slater’s in Pont Street (sometimes reported as Bond Street, but Pont Street is closer to their home) and were knocked down in Eaton Square. |
| Indexer, later at Pearson’s Ltd | Emily Maud Maxwell Hoey (age 29) at 20 Carlyle Square, Chelsea, daughter of Clement James Hoey, wine merchant. In 1891 she was living on own means. Her name is incorrect in the 1911 census: Emily Maud Maxwell Hory (age 39) living at 2 Vale Terrace, King’s Road, Chelsea, with friend Estella Maude Page Deane, both working for C. Arthur Pearson Ltd, publishers. Pearson’s was best known for the _Daily Express_ newspaper, and the _Royal Magazine_, a literary magazine. Emily was an ‘indexer’. Estella was in charge of the manuscript department. Emily died in 1931, address 118 Holland Park Avenue. |
| Indexer, later Royal Society | Christina Barnard (age 35) in the family home at 31 Chatsworth Road, Willesden, London. Her father was sub-manager of an Indian Bank and she was one of seven children. In 1891 she was a student and the family were in Belsize Crescent, Hampstead, London; they had previously been elsewhere in London, in Kensington and Islington. Between 1905 and 1908 Christina was admitted three times to the Bethlem Hospital, where she was identified as ‘Secretary to Royal Society’, and in 1908 she was described as ‘Indexing for Royal Society’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn64" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn64">64</a></sup> In 1911 she was a boarder at New House Farm, All Stretton, Shropshire. The other boarders included a Clerk in Holy Orders, his wife, a Salvation Army Officer and a teacher. The work was Catalogue of Scientific Papers, so she was probably still working for the Royal Society at this time. In the 1920s electoral registers it can be seen that she lived in Lissenden Gardens, near Hampstead Heath, with her sister Jane Lindsay, who was a teacher. In the later 1920s she seems to have moved to Philbeach Gardens, Earls Court, and was living in a lodging house. She may also have later lived in Lewisham and Kensington. In 1939 she was a retired indexer living at 5 Makepeace Mansions, Hillway, Highgate, London. Christina died in 1951 in the Royal Hospital for Nervous Diseases in Edinburgh.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn65" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn65">65</a></sup> |
| Indexer | Christabel E. Ware (age 42; 35 in 1901 census but this is a mistake), lodging at 30 Montague Place, Bloomsbury, in 1901. Born 1859 in Ireland. Father Joseph an attorney and solicitor in Devon in 1861. In 1891 Christabel was a teacher in Edinburgh.

Mary Petherbridge opened a secretarial bureau in London in 1895 which offered a range of office services, including indexing; she also published a manual on indexing in 1904. In 1901 Mary was living at 48 Conduit Street, London, and was described as ‘Indexer and Translator’ and employer; in 1911 she was a few doors away at 52 Conduit Street, as an indexer. Mary was still described as an ‘Official Indexer to HM Government’ in 1939.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn32" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn32">32</a></sup> [Hazel Bell (2008](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R2): 93–7) also states that Mary gave instruction in technical indexing, which was combined with general secretarial work. She also published articles about indexing as an employment for women. The brief mentions in the census returns do not reflect the breadth of work that Mary undertook in her long career, covering the East India Company, the Drapers’ Company and Warrington Corporation, as well as government materials and historical records such as those for Cardiff.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn33" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn33">33</a></sup>

Also at 48 Conduit Street in 1901 was Harriet Frances Fenwick, who worked in the India Office, but was also described as ‘& Private Secretary Indexer’. In 1911 Harriet was in Bridport, Dorset, and described as an indexer.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn34" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn34">34</a></sup> During the First World War Harriet worked in the Command Pay Office in London in 1917, and in 1918 became a unit administrator QMWAAC at the Base Pay Office, Wimereaux, France, and was appointed MBE ([Black, 2015](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R3)). In 1939 Harriet was aged 68 and living in Shaldon, Devon, on private means;<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn35" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn35">35</a></sup> she died in 1952.

Margaret Helen James ([Young, 2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R21)), sister of librarian Minnie Stewart Rhodes James, was living in a lodging house at 47 Markham Square, Chelsea, London, in 1901.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn36" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn36">36</a></sup> While Chelsea may be an upmarket address in 2020, in 1901 this was a family home in a working-class area with two lodgers, the other being a clerk in the jute trade. Ten years earlier, in 1891, Margaret and Minnie were lodging in Torrington Square, Bloomsbury; Margaret was a secretary and Minnie was ‘unsettled’. This was a stone’s throw from Nancy Bailey’s addresses. In 1911 Margaret was living at 28 Bloomfield Terrace, Pimlico, just east of Chelsea Bridge Road, and she was an ‘occasional worker at indexing’. In 1891 Margaret published _Bogie tales of East Anglia_, a collection of folklore stories from Suffolk and Norfolk, where her family was located. This collection has recently been republished by Society of Indexers member Francis Young ([James, 1891](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R13)), and his introduction reproduces an obituary of Margaret that states she indexed the _Alpine Journal_ for about 40 years, as well as indexing works by her cousin M. R. James, Winston Churchill, Millicent Garrett Fawcett and Arthur Ruppin. The obituary only gives the more recent indexes she had worked on: Fawcett’s book was published in 1924, M. R. James’s in 1930, Churchill’s between 1933 and 1938 and Ruppin’s in 1934, so it would be very interesting to find out more about earlier works she indexed.

(Ethel) Maud Samson (age 29) from Alderley Edge, Cheshire, was living at 16 Victoria Gardens, Kensington, London, in 1901.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn37" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn37">37</a></sup> Her occupation is given as ‘Indexing Classical Coaching, Secretarial Work’. On census night her visitor was Mildred Pope, a tutor at Somerville College, Oxford,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn38" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn38">38</a></sup> and later to be the first woman to hold a readership at Oxford University. Maud married William John White in 1903, and she was working from home in Radlett, Hertfordshire, as an ‘Indexer and Classical Coach’ in 1911.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn39" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn39">39</a></sup> She had studied classics at Somerville College and was described by [Vera Brittain (1960](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R4): 96) as ‘a future stalwart of feminism and Socialism who upheld both causes in vigorous speeches throughout a long life’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn40" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn40">40</a></sup> [Elizabeth Crawford (2013](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R6): 108, 110) claims Maud was secretary to May Abrahams, Britain’s first woman factory inspector, and was also secretary of the WSPU (Women’s Social and Political Union) branch in Radlett. Maud White was arrested and imprisoned in November 1911 after taking part in a WSPU deputation in London.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn41" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn41">41</a></sup>

In 1939 Maud was aged 68 and living with her retired husband at 23 Letchmore Road, Watford, Hertfordshire.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn42" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn42">42</a></sup> She was described as ‘Editor (of Opportunity) and Indexer of books’. _Opportunity_ was the organ of the Federation of Women Civil Servants; it ran between 1922 and 1940. In 1949 Mrs White, chairman of the Open Door Council, and ‘a lively 77-year-old’, was campaigning in Manchester to encourage women workers to stand together as trade unionists and to bargain for the rate for the job. She was quoted as saying,

> I am not concerned for myself. There are very few indexers of books and I fix my own rates. But I think it is appalling that the Labour Government, who have always supported the principle of equal pay, should burden women workers with responsibility for the country’s recovery and yet flout their right to earn as much as men for the same work.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn43" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn43">43</a></sup>

Caroline Thomson (age 27), living at 4 Wellington Road, Camberwell, London, was described as a ‘Commercial Clerk Indexer’ in the 1901 census. In the 1911 census she was described as ‘Clerk newspaper magazine’ and her employer was _Review of Reviews_, which was one of W. T. Stead’s journals.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn44" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn44">44</a></sup>

Mary Watts (age 38) was the elder sister of painter and illustrator Caroline Watts.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn45" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn45">45</a></sup> Caroline illustrated translations of Arthurian and other romances by folklorist Jessie L. West that were published by David Nutt. Elizabeth Crawford wondered whether Mary indexed for the David Nutt firm ([Crawford, 2014](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R7)). Caroline was associated with the suffragette cause, producing the Bugler Girl image used by the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS). Mary and Caroline lived with their father until his death in 1894 and then together until Caroline’s death in 1919. They were born in Harborne, Warwickshire, and their father was a button manufacturer originally from Chiswick. When he retired, they moved to Twickenham, and after his death Mary and Caroline were living together at 83 Charlwood Street, Pimlico, in 1901.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn46" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn46">46</a></sup> In 1911 they were in Oakdene Road, Godalming, Surrey, Mary still an indexer, and later they moved to Colehill, Dorset. Mary may be the Mary E. L. Watts who died in Weymouth in 1930.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn47" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn47">47</a></sup>

Hansard indexer Elizabeth Norah Fenwick Hele (age 39) appears in the 1901 census living at 68 Westbourne Park Road, Notting Hill, London, as an indexer, in 1911 she was in Pimlico as an ‘Indexer of books etc’ and in the 1939 Register she was a ‘retired Indexer of Hansard’ and lived in Hastings.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn48" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn48">48</a></sup> In 1881 she had passed the Civil Service Examination as clerk in the savings’ bank department of the General Post Office.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn49" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn49">49</a></sup> Her father was Nicholas Fenwick Hele, surgeon, in Aldeburgh, Suffolk, and her mother was Harriet Schute, who supported the 1866 Suffrage Petition organized by Elizabeth Garrett, who was from Aldeburgh ([Crawford, 2015](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R8)).

Armistead Cay (age 28) was living at Stedham Chambers, 26 Coptic Street, Bloomsbury. His occupation was given as ‘Indexer Card System Expert’. His background was in journalism: in the 1891 census he was shown as a reporter living in Weston, now a suburb of Bath.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn50" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn50">50</a></sup> There, in 1897–8, Cay produced the _New Catalogue of British Literature_ for the years 1896–7. The subtitle of the book gives a clue as to how this was compiled: ‘A record of the publications of the year arranged in a numerical sequence, with full details of the books, and two indexes: – (1) Subjects and titles. (2) Authors’. His co-author was Cedric Chivers, a bookbinder and bookseller from Bath.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn51" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn51">51</a></sup> The _Cambridge bibliography of English literature_ classified this volume as a trade periodical ([Bateson, 1940](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R1): 101), running from September 1895 to August 1898. The editorial boasted that

> our plan of indexing allows of the identification of any book under either its author, title, or subject, and the system of numbering each book (and in future a prefix letter to denote the year of issue) will enable us to compile cumulative indexes in a manner which will greatly serve the convenience of all book-buyers.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn52" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn52">52</a></sup>

Cay also produced books on shorthand and on George Woodiwiss, the mayor of Bath.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn53" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn53">53</a></sup> In the 1911 census Cay was the editor of a technical journal, living in Wimbledon, and in the 1939 Register a freelance journalist, and back in Bath, where he died in 1957.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn54" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn54">54</a></sup> The catalogue may have been his only foray into indexing.

Annie Riley Myles (age 55) was a widow and boarder at 7 Lincoln Street, Chelsea, and described as an ‘Indexer & Copyist’ and working at home. In the 1911 census she was recorded as writing, copying and of private means, and still living at the same address.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn55" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn55">55</a></sup> Annie was born near Liverpool and her family later moved to Wednesbury, but she was sent away to a school in Stratford Street, Aston. Annie Riley Brown was married to the Rev. Percy Myles in 1874 in Wednesbury. Percy was curate of Hillingdon, London, in the 1870s, and chaired musical entertainments in the village schoolroom, at which Annie sang with a fine contralto voice,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn56" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn56">56</a></sup> and by 1891 they were living in Hanwell, Ealing. Percy died in October 1891 and was buried in the Kensington Cemetery in Ealing.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn57" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn57">57</a></sup> The newspaper description of his burial showed that Percy was interested in botanical research and produced a pronunciation guide for George Nicholson’s _Illustrated Dictionary of Gardening_. Percy was also editor of the Selborne Society’s magazine, _Nature Notes._<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn58" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn58">58</a></sup> Annie provided the index to _Nature Notes_ and is acknowledged in various issues. She became secretary of the local branch in Richmond and continued to be involved with the Society, her name appearing in various newspaper accounts of the Society’s activities. In the 1890s Annie was living at 21 Sloane Terrace, her name appearing in newspaper advertisements in connection with a Miss Brown who gave singing lessons. She died in 1913.

By the time of the 1901 census there were many other people, mostly women, who are described as indexers, but it is difficult to separate those who were engaged in office filing from those who produced indexes for published books (see [Table 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#T3)). In 1901 there are also two people involved in the production of office business systems. William Fortune was a ‘Card Indexing Expert Maker’ who by 1911 was a ‘Managing Director of a Business Systems Company’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn59" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn59">59</a></sup> William Gould was a ‘Maker and Dealer of Card Index Appliances’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn60" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn60">60</a></sup>

### 1911 census

As the century progressed more women were entering the workforce in offices and commercial businesses. Over 200 people had an occupation that included the term ‘index’ or ‘indexer’. The following paragraphs describe people whose work can be identified as book indexing or other related activity. There were also assorted indexers and index clerks (see [Table 4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#T4)).

#### Encyclopedia indexers

The 11th edition of _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ was published in 1910–11.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn75" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn75">75</a></sup> Theodora Bosanquet (age 30) was identified by [Bell (2008](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R2): 101) as a secretary at Mary Petherbridge’s bureau, an indexer and amanuensis of Henry James, but in the 1911 census she appears at 14 Hastings House, Tonbridge Street, Bloomsbury, as an indexer working for the Encyclopaedia Britannica Company.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn76" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn76">76</a></sup> Others in London with this, or similar, roles were:

•

Grace Kuhler (age 28) at 46 Mulgrave Road, Neasden.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn77" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn77">77</a></sup>

•

Amy Thompson (age 23) visiting at 1 Mecklenburgh Street, Bloomsbury; this was a mixed boarding house.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn78" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn78">78</a></sup>

•

Louisa Thornton (age 36) at 62 Seymour Place, Marylebone, described as ‘literary work at present employed on Encyclopedia Britannica index’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn79" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn79">79</a></sup>

•

Maud Beach (age 36) at 10 Priory Gardens, Highgate, described as ‘Indexer Encyclopedia’, although it does not state it was the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ in her case. Maud was recorded living in Margate in the 1939 Register as a retired indexer.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn80" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn80">80</a></sup>

•

Emma Keefe (age 18) at 48 Marsala Road, Lewisham, described as ‘Index Clerk, Ency. Britt. Coy’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn81" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn81">81</a></sup>

•

Annie Hooker (age 28) at 35 Warner Road, Camberwell, described as ‘Index Clerk, Encyclopedia Co’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn82" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn82">82</a></sup> Also at this address, but as a separate household, was Rosa Wilkins, an index clerk, but for chemistry, not for the encyclopedia.

#### Newspaper indexers

Hazel [Bell (2008](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R2): 65–6) discusses Samuel Palmer, indexer of _The Times_. Samuel died in 1899, but his wife and daughter continued to compile the index. Agnes Palmer (age 49), ‘Index Compiler’, and her daughter Agnes Eva (age 18), ‘Assistant Compiler of Index’, lived at Richmond House, Crescent Road, Shepperton.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn83" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn83">83</a></sup> Agnes was also doing this work in 1901, but her name did not come up in the general search. Samuel’s son, George Palmer, lived at 2 Dorian Villas, Vicarage Road, Sunbury, Middlesex, and was also an ‘Assistant Compiler of Index’. George was a son from Samuel’s first marriage and had other roles before compiling the index.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn84" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn84">84</a></sup> _The Times_ also had index clerks Bertie Ellis (age 22), living at 25 Grove Green Road, Leytonstone, and Daisy Harrison (age 26), living at 31 Billington Road, New Cross. Charles Geake (age 47), living at 10 St George’s Road, Forest Gate, London, was a newspaper indexing clerk, although his employer is not given.

Outside London people were working on newspaper indexes in Manchester and Wales. In Manchester Peter Graham (age 44), at 20 St Bees, Moss Side, was the ‘Manager of the Index and Reference Division’ for a newspaper publisher.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn85" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn85">85</a></sup> Sisters Elsie and Emily Robson (ages 20 and 24), at 46 Delamere Road, Levenshulme, were index clerks for a newspaper proprietor.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn86" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn86">86</a></sup> In Wales, Amy Credland (age 35), originally from Manchester, at 7 Rhiw Bank Avenue, Llandrillo Yn Rhos, was an indexer in a newspaper office.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn87" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn87">87</a></sup>

Lloyd’s Shipping Index was edited by Robert Ritherdon, of Coniston, 32 Cambridge Road, Bromley, Kent.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn88" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn88">88</a></sup> In previous censuses he was described as an editor, without linking him to Lloyd’s Shipping Index.

#### Institutional indexers

In 1911 Olive Rayne Garnett (age 39) was living at 303a Sandycombe Road, Kew, with her younger brother Arthur.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn89" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn89">89</a></sup> Both gave their employer as ‘Government, Royal Botanic Gardens Kew’. Olive gave her role as ‘Index Compiler’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn90" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn90">90</a></sup> Olive (sometimes Olivia) was the daughter of Richard Garnett, Keeper of Printed Books at the British Museum.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn91" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn91">91</a></sup> Two volumes of her diaries have been published by Barry [Johnson (1989](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R14); 1993), covering the years 1890 to 1895, _Tea and anarchy! The Bloomsbury diary of Olive Garnett 1890–1893_ and _Olive and Stepniak: the Bloomsbury diary of Olive Garnett 1893–1895_. Research to date has focused on her time in Russia at the end of the 1890s and publication of her short stories, _Petersburg tales_ (1900) and _In Russia’s night_ (1918), and the influence of other members of her family, particularly her sister-in-law Constance, on the public interest in Russia in the early twentieth century through publication and translation of Russian authors.

There is little in the public domain about Olive’s work at Kew, or what kind of indexing she may have done. While a temporary assistant in the Herbarium, Olive’s Russian skills were used to translate reports about Kew written by V. J. Lipsky, of the Imperial Botanic Gardens at St Petersburg.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn92" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn92">92</a></sup> The _Kew Bulletin_ did not include temporary assistants in the list of staff it published annually. Her brother Edward William Garnett worked in a number of publishing houses and was a friend of Joseph Conrad, Ford Madox Ford and D. H. Lawrence, among others.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn93" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn93">93</a></sup> Olive was also a friend of Ford. She was also active in the suffrage movement and is listed by [Crawford (2003](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R5): 598) as being in the Richmond branch of the London Society for Women’s Suffrage (NUWSS). Olive was in Kew until at least 1915, according to the electoral registers. Arthur left Kew in 1915, and Olive may also have left at the same time.

Olive was living at Orchard End, East Hendred, near Wantage, Berkshire (now Oxfordshire) between 1919 and 1950, according to the electoral registers. In the 1939 Register Olive was listed as an ‘Authoress Indexer’. She died in Minehead in 1958,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn94" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn94">94</a></sup> and did not publish anything further after 1918, according to [Gillian Sutherland (2015](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R18): 163), but must have supported herself during this time.

Two indexers worked for the Royal Society in 1911, in addition to Christina Barnard described in 1901 (see [Table 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#T3)). These are probably best thought of as being cataloguers and bibliographers. Marie Vagner (age 49) was at 10 Denbigh Street, Pimlico, described as ‘Indexer etc catalogue scientific papers’ for the Royal Society. She took charge of the preparation of material for press and proofreading from 1916 to 1922. Hannah [Gay (2013)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R10) has written about the making of the fourth series of the _Royal Society Catalogue of Scientific Papers_ between 1901 and 1915.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn95" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn95">95</a></sup> During the 1920s Marie helped anthropologist Sir Richard Carnac Temple research the _Travels of Peter Mundy in Europe and Asia_ by ‘unearthing little-known works by German authors to elucidate Mundy’s text, in supplying historical notes and in giving substantial assistance with Mundy’s Samoyed vocabulary’ ([Temple, 1925](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R19): ix). In the 1930s Marie was living in Endsleigh Street, Bloomsbury, according to electoral registers, and in 1939 she was retired and living in Taviton Street, Bloomsbury, as a retired bibliographer and research worker.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn96" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn96">96</a></sup> She died on 28 October 1946 in 139 Pickhurst Lane, Hayes, Kent. Beatrice Goode (age 25) also worked for the Royal Society; she was living at 20 St Pauls Road, Camden Town; she probably died in 1918 and nothing further is known about her.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn97" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn97">97</a></sup> Elizabeth Hundel (age 16), at 21 Carlingford Road, Tottenham, London, was recorded as a ‘Card Index Clerk’ for the British Medical Association.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn98" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn98">98</a></sup>

Three members of one family are recorded as ‘index compilers’ for the Stationers’ Company, where publications were required to be registered until the 1911 Copyright Act came into force.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn99" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn99">99</a></sup> Annie Mildred (age 32), Edith Winifred (age 25) and Helena Salome Dickin (age 34) were living at 21 Priory Gardens, Highgate. In the 1901 census Helena and Annie were both recorded as index compilers, but the employer is not given.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn100" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn100">100</a></sup> Helena assisted with publications such as transcriptions of the registers.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn101" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn101">101</a></sup> She married Henry Bernard Dickin, musical journalist, in 1917; he died in 1922, Helena in 1951.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn102" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn102">102</a></sup>

#### Authors with indexing on the side

Constance Mary Foot (age 50) was living at 48 Digby Mansions, Hammersmith, with a housekeeper.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn103" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn103">103</a></sup> She is described as ‘Indexer and writer for children’. The British Library holds three titles by her: _Science through stories_ (1907), _Insect wonderland_ (1910) and _In and around London_ (1915). In the 1920s her work was broadcast on the radio: for example, an essay on sumptuary laws and vanity on 2LO on 18 February 1925.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn104" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn104">104</a></sup> Nothing is known about her indexing.

Philippa Elise Tyler (age 35) was living at 7 Queen Anne’s Grove, Bedford Park, Chiswick, as an ‘Indexer Translator etc’. In 1901 she had been a ‘Secretary (pupil)’ living in Upper Gloucester Place, Marylebone.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn105" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn105">105</a></sup> The British Library holds two titles by her: _A quest for a fortune_ (1924) and _The Lushington mystery_ (1919). Another title not held is _The Manaton disaster_ (1920),<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn106" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn106">106</a></sup> listed as a readable novel and described as a ‘very striking story … the character-drawing … is as interesting as the unravelling of the threads by which the disaster is gradually made clear to the reader’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn107" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn107">107</a></sup> She died in 1946 at 67 Holland Park, Kensington. Her father, Charles, was a major general in the Royal Artillery, and she was sent away to school by the age of four. Nothing is known about her indexing.

Dorothea Letitia Maguire (age 52) was living at 48 St Charles Square, Kensington, described as an indexer and ‘of private means’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn108" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn108">108</a></sup> She was the daughter of a clergyman and had been a teacher. In 1906 she published _Historic links: topographical aids to the reading of history_, a book aimed at children. In 1918 she published _Ladder of vision_. She died in 1937 in Bristol. Nothing is known about her indexing.

#### Book indexers

Of the 59 people using ‘indexer’ as part of their occupational description in the 1911 census, only one has been identified as working on books that were published with indexes: Jessie H. Hayllar (age 41) living at 19 Highdown Road, Hove.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn109" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn109">109</a></sup> Jessie had a query published in _Notes and Queries_ on 8 April 1911, stating that she was producing an index for the _Coventry Leet Book_ edited by Mary Dormer Harris and asking if it would help readers to have dates added after names of persons, especially if members of the families shared the same names ([Hayllar, 1911](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R12)). The fourth volume of the Leet Book, with the indexes, was published by the Early English Text Society in 1913. Mary Dormer Harris, an ardent suffragist and a local historian in Warwickshire,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn110" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn110">110</a></sup> was probably a friend of the family; Jessie’s sister Florence wrote a memoir of her for a book of plays and essays by [Harris (1939)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#core-R11). Jessie remained a spinster and died on 1 July 1930.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#fn111" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn111">111</a></sup>

#### Publishers’ indexers

Ten index clerks related to publishers appear in the census: Gertrude Andrews, Phyllis Brereton Catty, Annie Eborn, sisters Annie and Helen Grieef, Ellen Hall, Norah Harwood, Lilian Groves, Minnie Pickup, Annie Simms and Elizabeth Rosina Whetstone. While they were almost certainly not involved in the production of book indexes, they show that alphabetized information was becoming important in good business practice.

#### Indexers, assorted

[Table 4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#T4) lists those people whose job title in the 1911 census included indexing, but whose work cannot be directly linked to book index production. It includes civil servants and a large number of individuals whose work can be linked to publishing, printing, bookbinding, bible production, stationery production and office equipment manufacturing, but about whom little could be found in the source material to clarify what their work entailed. Card indexers and index clerks are discussed in the next section.

#### Card indexers and index clerks

The 1911 census saw many people working with card indexes and as index clerks in a range of businesses ([Table 5](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.35#T5)). There were also 16 index clerks whose line of business was not recorded or could not be read from the census entry.

## Conclusions

The census returns and other sources consulted offer fascinating glimpses into the lives of indexers from the 1880s onwards. The vast majority of people identified with ‘indexer’ in their job title were female. As women entered the workforce they could use their indexing skills for a number of tasks that involved alphabetization. Some of these tasks were related to publishing, but other ‘indexers’ were engaged in civil service occupations and a range of other employment sectors. However, few people could be specifically identified as book indexers, compared to the total of people using ‘index’ in one form or another in their job title.

The subject should be revisited when the 1921 census returns become available in 2022. Meanwhile, British indexers might like to consider how they represent their employment when the next census is carried out on 21 March 2021. Future work could broaden to include the educational background of the indexers, their marital status, and the role of women within the civil service.
