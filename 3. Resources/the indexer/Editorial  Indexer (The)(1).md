Publication: The Indexer: The International Journal of Indexing

Volume 39, Number 4

This issue has come together in strange and wonderful ways. It pivots around two important events in the indexing world – the online conference hosted by the Indexing Society of Canada/Société canadienne d’indexation (ISC/SCI) in May 2021 and the publication of Dennis Duncan’s eagerly awaited book _Index, a history of the_ in September 2021.

As advertised, the ISC/SCI conference was ‘indexing unlimited’. The conference was well run and packed with interesting presentations (see the report in this issue for details), but perhaps its best feature was the opportunity it provided for indexers around the world to connect. In particular it was fertile ground for a group of multilingual indexers who started a discussion during the conference that ultimately produced an impressive ‘dictionary of basic indexing terminology’ in six languages that I am excited to publish in this issue. Jochen Fassbender, who skilfully led this effort, has also used his admirable language abilities to review the Spanish translation and adaptation of _The Chicago Manual of Style_ (the _Manual de estilo Chicago-Deusto_) for us. I hope you will enjoy the harvest from this very productive, multilingual, and inspiring conference!

Also in this issue is Bob Jansen and Glenda Browne’s article on the use of wiki technology to create a navigation structure that can be an index, a mind map and a topic map. I wonder how we might push the boundaries of online indexing for other material, such as the ‘dictionary of basic indexing terminology’. I am hopeful that it will expand, perhaps on _The Indexer_ website and/or with future updates in the journal. We are no longer including Centrepieces, which were the self-contained pull-outs published in the past. That might have been a logical place for the dictionary. While it will not get any special treatment in the print edition this time, like all articles in the journal it will be published in a digital version. Subscribers who would like to keep this valuable reference handy are welcome to download it separately. And you can find a list of older Centrepieces on the _The Indexer_ website.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.35#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> The majority are guides for handling names in various languages but they also cover topics such as numbers in indexing and cookbook indexing.

The release of _Index, a history of the_ (Duncan) coincided with the deadline for getting this issue into production but, thanks to the efforts of Penguin Books and Michele Combs, we are able to include a review. Thanks again to Michele for sharing her delight in this book and its wonderful index by Paula Clarke Bain. Christine Shuttleworth also managed to sneak in some lovely comments about that index in ‘Indexes reviewed’ at the last minute. I am sure there will be more to come.

Sadly, we are leading this issue with an obituary for Drusilla Calvert, MACREX founder and much-loved Society of Indexers member. Thank you to Ann Kingdom for her lovely remembrance of Drusilla. I know that writing this was hard for Ann, but I hope it brought many good memories for her and will do the same for you, despite what I am sure will be a few tears.

The Bernard Levin Award presented to Drusilla Calvert in 2002 reminded me of the inspiring words in the advertisement for the ISC/SCI conference. Drusilla was lauded for her ‘willingness to share skills and knowledge with other indexers, ability to solve the most intractable problems and make light of difficulties’. The ISC/SCI conference organizers noted that the world is ‘changing in a flash’ and asked whether indexers were ‘up to it?’ The answer was a resounding ‘Of course! As long as we have the knowledge and the network to tap into’. That seems to be the theme that has somehow organically emerged from the content of this issue – we have a long history of indexing knowledge to tap into and the ability and ingenuity to handle the challenges of the future together.
