## Abstract

Dennis Duncan’s latest book, _Index, a history of the_, has received much coverage since publication in September 2021, as has its index by Society of Indexers member Paula Clarke Bain. Dennis and Paula have presented at many of the main indexing conferences over the year, together and solo as author and indexer. In this article, Paula Clarke Bain reflects on their recent presentations at the Society of Indexers (UK), the American Society for Indexing (ASI) and the Indexing Society of Canada/Société canadienne d’indexation (ISC/SCI) conferences, and looks ahead to the international indexing conference in Berlin in October 2022, where they will be back presenting together again.

## Introduction

It has been quite a year in the life of _Index, a history of the_. Dennis Duncan’s latest book was published by Allen Lane in the UK on 2 September 2021, and the US edition was published by W. W. Norton on 15 February 2022. Given its considerable interest to indexers, it has also been a central part of several of the major indexing conferences over the year, including those of the Society of Indexers (SI), the American Society for Indexing (ASI), and the Indexing Society of Canada/Société canadienne d’indexation (ISC/SCI), and will again feature at the international indexing conference held in conjunction with the ICRIS (International Committee of Representatives of Indexing Societies) triennial meeting in Berlin in October 2022. Between us, Dennis Duncan (DD) and I (PCB) have enjoyed giving our presentations, and here I will give a summary of each one, how the presentations have developed over the year, the ways in which we conveyed the author–indexer relationship, and what we have learned in the process.

## Society of Indexers 2021 conference

### ‘Index, a history of the_: a bookish adventure by author and indexer’ (DD and PCB)_

The first conference presentation was our joint keynote at the SI conference on 9 November 2021. As with other recent events, this had to be run as an online conference, which is a different experience for speakers and listeners than in person, but better than no conference at all, and in many ways more accessible to those who may not normally attend.

Our keynote was the opening session of the conference. (No pressure.) Dennis and I had discussed what sorts of things we wanted to cover, by email and Zoom, for the hour-long presentation. I created a set of PowerPoint slides, to keep us on track with our conversation and for some visual interest to illustrate some key points for the delegates. I used a template which reminded me of an index card layout, and I changed the bullet points on the slides into manicule symbols, which amused both Dennis and me, and perhaps a few others.

After some conference opening words of welcome, we began our presentation. [Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.20#F1) shows the table of contents of what we were to cover in the session.

### _Book, writing of_

Dennis took the lead in this first section, discussing the background to the research, writing and publication of the book. In this, he talked about how his interest in indexes developed from his studies of experimental French literature and the Oulipo group, as many of their novels contained indexes. He had written an article for the _Times Literary Supplement_ ([Duncan, 2017](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.20#core-R2)) in support of the Society of Indexers’ first National Indexing Day in 2017 (which I co-founded with SI member Ruth Ellis). Following this article, publishers started to contact him expressing their interest in publishing his book, and eventually the book was contracted by Allen Lane/Penguin, one of the ‘Big Five’ UK trade book publishers. This changed how Dennis wrote the book, as it now needed to be more accessible and more fun than the ‘dry’ academic book he had originally been expecting to publish. The UK edition was published on 2 September 2021, with a beautiful cover design by Olga Kominek (see [Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.20#F2)).

### _Author–indexer relations_

We then both talked about the author–indexer relations on this book – the commission, collaboration and communication. We began with the choice of indexer. I had first met Dennis at the 2016 SI conference in Birmingham, where he had given a fascinating and entertaining talk about his indexing research. He had said then that he was writing a history of the book index, and I made sure to express an interest in being its indexer (possibly over a drink in the pub after the conference). I suspect I was not the only indexer who registered their interest. We had met again for the 2017 SI conference in Oxford and Dennis’s symposium on ‘The Book Index’, where I was part of the ‘Indexing Now’ panel of professional indexers (along with Ann Hudson, Ann Kingdom, Janice Rayment and Pilar Wyman). Dennis spoke again at the 2019 SI conference in London, by which point the book was under contract with Penguin, a publisher I was already indexing for, and we made a verbal agreement (in the bar) along the lines of ‘Let’s do this then’. It was still a long way from publication, though, so I never took anything for granted. We kept in touch in the meantime, on Twitter and by email. I had also been adding to my comedy index blog,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.20#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> which Dennis would often like and share, and this proved to be quite a factor in his indexer choice, particularly once the book content became more anecdotal and fun, as we had a similar sense of humour and view of index wit. Another factor in his choice was that I was SI marketing director on the executive board at the time, as Dennis wanted someone with some experience and standing in the indexing community.

Dennis and I mostly kept in contact by email from the official commission and estimate stage in late 2020 onwards, and we also had a couple of Zoom calls during the indexing process to share ideas, before final approval of the index by email. We briefly mentioned the process of working from page proofs and that Dennis was happy to give me licence to play with this index, and play I certainly did.

### _Indexing, process of_

I then spoke a little of the indexing process, noting the ‘meta-ness’ of indexing a book about book indexes, not least of which was indexing myself in the index, a definite first (and possibly last) for me. I highlighted that I was aware of the different readerships for the book – some would be more general readers with little knowledge of indexes, as it was a trade book; there would also be academic and scholarly readers, and readers from the indexing community. From Dennis’s brief, I knew that the index would need to perform some dual roles, with a good useful index at its base but also its entertaining side, so it would have to be ‘serious but silly’.

I further illustrated this by talking about the extract in the book that shows the difference between letter-by-letter and word-by-word order, with an example taken from entries from this book’s own index ([Duncan, 2021](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.20#core-R3): 240–1).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.20#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> The example illustrates whether the actors Paul Newman and Gary Oldman come before or after the book titles _New York trilogy_ and _Old Possum’s book of practical cats_. The example was an unusual part of the job, as I had to index these pages initially with placeholder text, then create the index and extract the ‘New’ and ‘Old’ index entries, which were then added to the main text at the next round of proofs (see [Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.20#F3)).

### _Computers in indexing_

We talked next about the other index in the book, which Dennis generated using a computer software program (see [Figure 4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.20#F4)). Dennis did two versions of this, as the first one was so bad it was unusable, but he did send it to me first for a look and a laugh. One of the problems of this index (or rather concordance) was that ‘Cher’ seemed to appear on many pages, to Dennis’s surprise. The software had picked up this name from ‘Hugh of St Cher’, a key figure in the development of the Bible concordance in thirteenth-century France. Not the right person at all. Dennis spoke of wanting to include a few pages of an automated index in the appendix to show the problems it can cause, with its word spotting and inclusion of all passing mentions, and to contrast it with what a human indexer can do.

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2022.20/asset/e855345e-5aea-421d-a74e-bdf3ecd9828c/assets/graphic/indexer_2022_20_fig4.jpg)

### _Indexer, personality of_

We then came to the indexer voice in the index. Dennis had been very clear in his brief to me that he wanted the indexer personality to come through in the index, as this is a point that he illustrates with indexers of the past in this book. He wanted the index to have humour and a similar snarky wit. I noted that this is a very unusual brief to get, as indexers are supposed to be neutral and impartial in their treatment of the text. For this book, though, subjectivity and personality were key. I shared an image of my introductory note to the index (see [Figure 5](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.20#F5)), which ends:

> This index was created by Paula Clarke Bain, who is a professional indexer and a human being. \[PCB\]

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2022.20/asset/79a71199-2715-4b6a-9508-8373fc336ff4/assets/graphic/indexer_2022_20_fig5.jpg)

Figure 5. Introductory note to the index

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.20#F5)

I used this square-bracketed text with my initials several times through the index for places where I am interjecting as the indexer, to emphasise that the index has been written by a person, and not the same person who wrote the book. Of course, we would never normally do this as indexers, but it was a great opportunity to try this out and see if it worked.

### _Index wit: the funny bits_

Next we looked at some of the index wit from the book, with examples of the following:

•

Cross-references – some strange things going on here, including deliberately broken, circular, hanging and serial cross-references, many of which toy with the reader and send them the wrong way or on a wild goose chase.

•

Crossword-type word play (as I am also in training as a cryptic-crossword setter) – there are a few anagrams in the index, and an acrostic in the subheads under my name. I do see parallels between writing crossword clues and index entries, which I intend to explore further.

•

Snark against the machine – I did want to put some snark in the index, but did not want to be too snarky about Dennis, because I like Dennis and it’s a great book, so the computer index was useful here as something I could aim some snark against (e.g. ‘automated indexing: attempts to index like a human 254; fails 304–7’).

•

Beginnings and endings – the index begins with ‘_A, a, a_’ and we both wanted it to have a more defined ending than just ‘Zwinger, Theodor’ (sorry, Theodor), so my final index entry is

> _Z, z, z_, ‘And so to bed’ \[PCB\]

This ties in with the Samuel Pepys diary index mentioned in the book, and gives the indexer the literal last word at the end of her work.

•

Word golf – this was a late suggestion by Dennis to add to the index, as word golf is relevant to two authors in the book, Vladimir Nabokov (who incudes it in _Pale fire_) and Lewis Carroll, who popularised it as a word game called ‘doublets’ in the British magazine _Vanity Fair_. I used the first example Carroll published in 1879 – changing the word HEAD to TAIL by amending one letter each time – and added a thread back from TAIL to HEAD, so you can follow this in the index cross-references as ‘head _see_ heal’, ‘heal _see_ teal’, and so forth, to go round in a circle from HEAD to TAIL and back again.

### _Syndrome, imposter_

We then both confronted a few potential negatives associated with this project. Both of us had felt some imposter syndrome and anxieties about peer pressure in our respective academic or indexing communities. Dennis felt this with how much of a trade book it became, rather than the scholarly book he had been expecting to write. I was well aware that many indexers would be looking at this book and index with a keen and perhaps critical eye. The index was also very exposing for me, and deliberately so to make a few points, but that can have good and bad consequences, depending on how you see it. The writing, indexing and publication of the book were also of course being done in the middle of a pandemic, and we have all had to find ways to cope. I think I did about the best I could, given the time, budget and circumstances, so I try to be happy with that. It was a fantastic opportunity but also a pretty big professional risk, and I hope it has paid off.

### _Reception, responses, reviews_

We ended on some real positives, discussing reviews and reader feedback. The book received many excellent reviews in newspapers and magazines, such as the _Guardian_, the _Literary Review_, the _Times Literary Supplement_ and William Hartston’s ‘Beachcomber’ column in the _Express_, several of which also mentioned the index and its indexer, and we showed some quotes from these. Dennis has also appeared in many podcasts and radio interviews, including on BBC Radio 4 and a conversation for 5x15 Stories with comedy producer John Lloyd.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.20#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup> There were some in-person events at last too, including Dennis in conversation with Richard Ovenden at Blackwell’s bookshop in Oxford in September 2021, which I was lucky enough to attend and meet Dennis for the first time since the 2019 SI conference. (And, yes, this did also end up in a pub.) Social media has been a factor too, with readers talking about the book on Twitter, and both Dennis and I being active in the ongoing conversations. We ended the presentation with a brief look ahead to the US edition, which was starting to be reviewed, and took a few questions on points we had not covered. There were no separate handouts, and the sessions for this conference were not recorded, but the PowerPoint slides were made available to attendees after the conference.

### _Lessons learned and evaluation_

We enjoyed presenting this keynote together, and attendees seemed to enjoy it too. Dennis is an experienced lecturer and excellent public speaker. I have not done that much of it, and I certainly get the associated nerves beforehand, but I’m surprising myself with how much I’m starting to enjoy building up my speaking experience at conferences and National Indexing Day events. It was very different doing this all online as a Zoom meeting, but we were glad to have a conference at all and at least get to see colleagues and friends that way.

Things calmed down a little after this, with the six-month lull between the UK and US editions, but we were both booked in for future indexing conferences, me for the 2022 ASI conference, and Dennis to be the keynote speaker for the 2022 ISC/SCI conference.

The US edition was published on 15 February 2022 to another flurry of reviews, interviews and podcasts, and we made our preparations for the next conferences.

## American Society for Indexing 2022 conference

### _‘_Index, a history of the_: a history of the index to’ (PCB)_

This time, it was a solo presentation by me for the 2022 ASI conference on 29 April, and again it was the opening session. It was rather strange preparing and giving this presentation without Dennis, but another new challenge for me that I hope I handled well.

The presentation mostly followed the same overall structure as for the SI conference, but I had updated the content and slides, as the book had since been released in US and Italian editions. I also paused for more questions throughout rather than saving them all for the end of the session, as I felt more comfortable with it being partly a discussion rather than just an hour of me talking at a screen with little feedback. Devon Thomas, ASI conference chair, introduced the session and handled these Q&A breaks expertly.

### _Opening the covers_

After briefly summarising the background to the book’s research and writing, I was now able to show three different versions of the book cover, adding the US edition by W. W. Norton and the Italian version by UTET Libri (published in January 2022) (see [Figure 6](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.20#F6)). I took a first pause for comments here, as there was quite a lot of opinion in the Zoom chat about which cover people preferred. (One came out rather worse than the other two.) The UK book cover is a colour illustration referencing the historical origins of the index from preaching; the US cover seems much more in a Google search style for the digital age, in colourful text on a bright yellow background; and the Italian edition features a black-and-white background image with extracts from the book’s own index, which was my original index translated by Chiara Baffa, rather than a re-index.

### _Indexing process_

The author–indexer relations and indexing process sections covered much of the same ground as at the SI conference, but I took another pause for questions after the Newman–Oldman letter-by-letter and word-by-word sorting example, which allowed for further discussion and clarification about how we worked on this example. Devon also raised some good questions about the indexing process, so I was able to talk further about how I had to treat the serious and silly sides of the indexing as separate passes, to allow the creative side some more space. We spoke about the need for more rounds of proofs than the normal single set, for the Newman–Oldman example and because my index refers to itself and the computer index, so I had to see which pages the indexes had been typeset on (although there are issues with this, which I will address below). Devon asked about the editorial side and whether there was much negotiation in getting the publisher to accept the more unusual entries. I confirmed that I put a lot of playful things in the index, not knowing how much Dennis would say yes to (although I suspected he would go for it all, as indeed he did), and then we were unsure how much the editor at the publisher would say yes to, but it was all approved; if anything, we took some quite sensible things out to allow the weirder side of the index more room.

This was followed by the computer indexes section (Cher still does not equal Hugh of St Cher) and the personality of the indexer. Here we had a little more discussion on software used for this index. I confirmed that I did the index as a standard back-ofbook index using SKY Index software. I also mentioned that Dennis originally wanted it as an embedded index, which I could have done, but sadly that did not fit in with the workflow of the UK publisher. This, of course, had implications for the ebook version too. The ebook contains an extra introductory note that the index page numbers link to what was the top of the printed book page. That could have been done much better, which we all agreed was a real shame. On the personality side, I spoke of ‘PCB’ as being like a snarkier persona of me, which allowed me to play around more with the index. Someone commented in the chat that they wished they were allowed to interject comments into all their indexes. Devon doubted that this would be ‘a responsible power’, and I agreed that it is not generally recommended, but it would have been a missed opportunity not to do it here.

### _Index wit_

I then ran through some more of the index wit and funny bits – the cross-references, crosswordiness, snark, beginnings and endings, and word golf, before stopping for another question time. Here I noted that, in the Italian index, Chiara had converted this to a five-letter word golf chain from _testa_ to _piedi_ (which translates as ‘head’ to ‘feet’), so that still works well. Some comments had been made in the Zoom chat about imagining what error messages I got from my indexing software with the rules I was breaking with the cross-references. (You can’t do that because there’s no target. _Yes, that’s the point_.) A few people mentioned that they had missed the acrostic under my name in the index until I had pointed it out. (Incidentally, the acrostic no longer works in the Italian version.) Some also said that the index had made them laugh out loud, and Devon told me that the humour of the book and index reminded her of Carroll, Edward Lear and abecedaria like Edward Gorey’s _Gashlycrumb tinies_ (‘A is for Amy who fell down the stairs’). Just the kind of literary humour we were trying to aim for, so that was lovely to hear. Devon liked the ‘crying’ serial cross-reference for conveying frustrations of indexer and reader, and I admitted that a lot of the index reflected my state of mind at the time with what a weird but wonderful job it was to do.

### _Imposter syndrome and added problems_

In the imposter syndrome section, unfortunately by now I had another negative point to consider. During the session, some people had asked whether the UK and the US versions were the same, other than the cover. I promised I would address this point, and now was the time to do so. I was told that the US edition text was ‘exactly the same’ as the UK version, and so there was no need for an updated index. Sadly, this was not entirely the case, as the list of figures was moved from the prelims in the UK book to the back of the US book, so bumping on the page numbers of the computer and human indexes. Normally this would not matter, as an index would not refer to itself. However, mine did refer both to itself and to the computer index, and so now those page numbers were wrong in the US edition, a fact which only came to light after publication. At the time of writing, this is getting fixed for future editions, but it was a very annoying and embarrassing situation with how exposed I am in this index. I said I had shed a few tears and said a few swear words about it, but it was done and another lesson learned. This received sympathetic comments and a few wails of anguish in the chat (Devon described it as a collective groan of ‘Oh no!’), so I’m sure others felt my pain.

### _Reviews and responses_

I moved on swiftly from this unhappy incident to end on some more positives. I covered a few of the UK press reviews and interviews again, and then focused more on the US reviews that had come out since the US publication. By now, I had a copy of the US hardback book and could include a picture of the blurb by Mary Norris on its back cover, which enthuses about Dennis Duncan’s history and ‘Paula Clarke Bain’s peerless index’ (see [Figure 7](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.20#F7)). I cannot recall another instance of an indexer being mentioned in a book’s cover blurb so I am highly delighted with that.

There were more excellent reviews in the US press, particularly in the week of publication, in newspapers such as the _New York Times_, the _Wall Street Journal_ and the _Washington Post_. They were full of praise for Dennis’s book – in fact it was the number one best-reviewed non-fiction book in the US that week – and several specifically mentioned my index, with comments calling it ‘enchanting’, ‘frolicky’, ‘mischievous … magnificent’, and ‘Hitchcockian’, which was all pretty mindblowing.

Another surprising but welcome development was being invited to talk about the book and index alongside Dennis for some podcasts. To date, our joint interviews have included _The Tiny Typecast_ (with host Glenn Fleishman), _The Colin McEnroe Show_ (an hour-long live show on Connecticut radio in which Colin refers to me as ‘the Notorious PCB’ throughout), and _That Word Chat_ (video, with host Mark Allen).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.20#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup> I spoke a little about how much fun these all were to do, and how bizarre and hilarious Dennis and I were by now finding this whole thing.

I ended with a couple of links to more information about working with authors – the conversation session that I did with SI member Tanya Izzard as part of the SI’s National Indexing Day event in March 2022 (live video on the day, but recorded, to be available on the SI website), and a link to my guide for authors working with indexers (originally commissioned for _The Author_, the journal of the Society of Authors, now also archived on my blog).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.20#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup>

The presentation was recorded and so available to those who registered for the conference, and the slides were available on request. I also provided a handout of links to the press reviews, podcasts and interviews, and included an index to my slides at the back.

### _Evaluation_

This one was quite a test for me, giving the whole presentation on my own, but it received some lovely feedback comments and it went about as well as I could have wished. A special thank you from me goes to Devon Thomas for keeping the Q&A time flowing and for making me feel so at ease and happy to be having more of a conversation in this session.

## ISC/SCI 2022 conference

### _‘A look back at our history’ (DD)_

A fortnight later, on 13 May 2022, the ISC/SCI conference arrived, with Dennis Duncan as the keynote speaker, and again as the opening session of the conference. I was an attendee at the conference so I got to listen in live and contribute a little to the discussions in the online Zoom chat, but this one was Dennis’s solo.

Dennis had recently given a (virtual) talk for the Boston Athenaeum and so had an interior shot of the building as his backdrop. He said he was going to focus on a few ideas and themes from the book on index history, and noted that he had researched the book for seven or eight years in Oxford, Cambridge and Washington.

He began his session by noting that he challenges those who think the subject might be rather niche by asking them the question, ‘When was the last time you looked something up on Google?’ (or asked Alexa or used a Ctrl-F search).

### _Early history_

He then went back to where his history begins, with the index being invented twice simultaneously around the year 1230. Dennis spoke about Hugh of St Cher in France and his word concordance to the Latin Bible, with 129,000 instances of 10,000 different words, noting that Bible concordances were needed for monastic preaching purposes. He contrasted this with Robert Grosseteste (‘big head’), who around the same time in Oxford was inventing a subject index using symbols to organise his prodigious reading matter and knowledge (see [Figure 8](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.20#F8)).

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2022.20/asset/4b9fa22d-c6da-44e5-b915-fd3c9488116f/assets/graphic/indexer_2022_20_fig8.jpg)

### _Some main characters_

A few more characters of note from the book were discussed. John Marbeck’s English translation of a Latin Bible concordance in 1543 was said to have perhaps saved his life from religious persecutors. The historian J. Horace Round (complete with photo of his moustache that Dennis said made him look like he had been ‘surprised by a massive croissant’) attacked his rival professor Edward Freeman in what Dennis described as an ‘out-of-control subject index … absolutely loaded with the subjectivity of its compiler’. \[Who would dare do such a thing now? – PCB\]

Ranulf Higden’s _Polychronicon_ was used as an example of a broken index, where the scribe John Lutton had copied out the manuscript plus its index by hand in 1386, without realising that its locators were only accurate for the original handwritten copy. Dennis also read out a passage from his book (Duncan, 2021: 85–6) about being nearly moved to tears by the ‘archival sublime’ experience of holding a copy of Werner Rolevinck’s _Sermo_ from 1470, containing ‘a single large capital J’ in the right-hand margin, the first printed page number.

### _Index anxieties_

Dennis commented on how the rise in indexes being included was also accompanied by increased anxiety about how they might be used. Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope were both shown to have expressed reservations about such ‘index hunting’ and ‘index learning’. Such anxieties were brought up to date with Dennis showing some tweets by Donald Trump accusing Google of ‘fake news’, and he stated that indexes have always been criticised for their choices of suppression and inclusion.

### _Index snark_

Dennis ended with a few stories about the use of index snark and spoof indexes to make personal points and settle scores. The Boyle versus Bentley controversy was discussed, in which William King’s index was used to attack Dr Richard Bentley by way of subentries such as ‘His egregious dulness’, ‘His pedantry’, etc. William King again used a satirical index in his anonymous publication _The Transactioneer_ to undermine the content of the _Philosophical Transactions_ of the Royal Society in an eye-opening way with its ‘pithy, sarky index entries’.

Some latter-day index snark was also mentioned, with examples from books including the bad poetry anthology _The stuffed owl_ and Francis Wheen’s _How mumbo-jumbo conquered the world_ (sample entry: ‘Aitken, Jonathan: admires risk-takers, 59; goes to jail, 60’).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.20#fn6" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn6">6</a></sup>

He finished with a splendid example of the ‘Washington read’ and Buckley versus Mailer. William F. Buckley Jr sent a copy of his book _The unmaking of a mayor_ to Norman Mailer, knowing full well that Mailer would look himself up in the index, so he had written ‘Hi’ in red pen next to Mailer’s name in the index. Dennis related that he has continued this prank by getting his publisher to write ‘Hi’ in red pen next to William Buckley’s name in the index for the copy of Dennis’s book that was sent to Buckley’s son Christopher. \[_See also_ the ‘Society of Indexers’ entry in my index for another callback. – PCB\]

### _Q&A_

A few further points were then raised in the Q&A session. These included more on tables of contents and their relation to indexes; indented versus run-on formats; why indexes may not be used so much in languages other than English (_see also_ the Berlin conference, below); what Dennis might be planning for his next book; and how the book changed from a scholarly to a trade one – basically ‘a lot more fun to write’ \[and indeed index – PCB\], which brings us back to where the SI conference session had started many months before. Another very entertaining talk by Dennis.

## ‘Continental Connections’ conference, Berlin 2022

Dennis and I will be presenting together again (see [Figure 9](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.20#F9)) at the ‘Continental Connections’ international indexing conference in Berlin on 17–18 October 2022, organised by the Deutsches Netzwerk der Indexer (DNI, German Network of Indexers), the Nederlands Indexers Netwerk (NIN, Netherlands Indexing Network) and the SI. This time we will be the closing session of the conference and our presentation will focus on ‘Translating the index of _Index, a history of the_’, hopefully with additional input from the Italian translator Chiara Baffa and the translator of the imminent German edition (_Index, eine Geschichte des_), Ursel Schafer. It is being planned as a hybrid conference, with attendees in person and online, and I do hope to travel to Berlin if possible, to meet up with fellow indexers again and continue the conversation about this book.

## Conclusions

_Index, a history of the_ was an absolute dream job to index and continues to be a delightful experience for the most part. It is a lovely example of how the author– indexer relationship can work, and the book and its index have drawn much attention to indexes and indexers, and made readers think and laugh. I have also enjoyed being involved with the conference sessions Dennis and I have done on it. The three conference sessions so far have all worked well, and each offered something different – the SI conference had more of the author–indexer relationship with both of us presenting; the ASI conference focused more on the index as presented by me as the indexer; and the ISC/SCI conference concentrated more on the book’s history and content as presented by Dennis as the author. It has been interesting to think back over these conferences and how the presentations have developed over the year as the book and index continue to have a life of their own. We wonder where these adventures will take us next. \[And _see_ you in Berlin? – PCB\]

‘Letter-by-letter’ or ‘all-through’ order ignores spaces between words, in contrast to ‘word-byword’ or ‘nothing-before-something’ order, in which shorter words precede longer ones, as [Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.20#F3) clearly demonstrates.
