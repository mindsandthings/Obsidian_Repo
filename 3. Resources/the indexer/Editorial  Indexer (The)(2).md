Publication: The Indexer: The International Journal of Indexing

Volume 39, Number 2

Sadly, we are leading off with an obituary, this time for Gales Rhoades, who was well known in the indexing community for her work with the Macrex indexing program. Nancy Mulvany and Do Mi Stauber in the US have collaborated with Gale’s family to write a remembrance of Gale’s life and work that is published in this issue. Tributes to Gale have also been posted in the online forums on the Society of Indexers (SI) website in the UK. These convey how extremely helpful Gale was to her colleagues. In particular, Christine Shuttleworth eloquently described who Gale was and what she did for others:

> Gale was a wonderful person and a brilliant teacher, endlessly patient and generous with her knowledge, experience and time. Not that long ago when I apologised for taking up too much of her time, she replied: ‘Never, ever hesitate to consult with me. It is absolutely my pleasure.’

Vale Gale Rhoades. You will be missed by many indexers around the world.

This issue also contains a mix of fascinating articles on the art of indexing. First up is Rebecca Bradburn’s mindful consideration of Marianne Moore’s index to her work _Observations_. I must confess that before reading this, I had not considered the indexing of poetry in any detail, and my first reaction to an author-indexed work has always been dismay. However, reading Bradburn’s article opened up my mind and gave me a fresh regard for the role of indexes in all literary genres and, in particular, the possibilities that an index can offer for creative exploration by an author. In works such as _Observations_, the index is not relegated to ‘paratext’ but rather ‘blurs into’ the poetry. As Bradburn points out, the poetry cannot be discussed without the index and vice versa. How delightful! I hope to include more articles in the future about the varied ways that indexes can enhance written works beyond their traditional role as finding aids.

Glynn Sutcliffe then takes us on a thought-provoking journey into the realm of biographies. As Maureen MacGlashan noted in her Editorial to the September 2012 issue of _The Indexer_ (**30**(3)), which contained articles on the theme of biography indexing, the ‘jury is out’ as to whether this type of indexing requires different skills. Glynn takes up this challenge by comparing the indexing of two related books, a biography of the chess player Bobby Fischer and a history of chess during the period of time when Fischer was competing. His assessment is that indexing biography is not different to other types of subject indexing. Maureen made the same assessment in her Editorial and even noted that she found indexing biographies ‘fun and quite relaxing’ compared to her other types of work. Is the jury still out then? I look forward to your thoughts on that. Letters to the Editor are always welcome and can be sent via email to [editor@theindexer.org](mailto:editor@theindexer.org).

Ælfwine Mischler then follows up her practical article on indexing Arabic names in the last issue (_The Indexer_ **39**(1), pp 71–83) with an insightful account of her experiences indexing an English translation of the _Fath al-Bari_ by Ibn Hajar. This is an important classic Islamic text that will be published in multiple volumes containing multiple indexes. It is a mammoth task for the indexer, and Ælfwine generously shares with us how she will tackle the job. She explains the many decisions that she has made so far about how and why to include not just names but places, works, and subject topics. At the time of writing, she had only just started on the second volume. I hope to hear more from her in future about this work and the intricacies of indexing Arabic names. I suspect there is much more that can be written about the important work of indexing the genre of religious texts as well.

Walter Greulich then offers us the fifth part of his series on embedded indexing with Word with a focus on locators other than page numbers. Interestingly, this article connects in some ways with Ælfwine Mischler’s description of how she will handle complex locators for the multiple volumes and indexes in the _Fath al-Bari_. As Walter notes, most publications that are indexed use page numbers as locators, but there are cases where other types of locators are needed or might be more useful. Thank you once again to Walter for explaining so clearly and carefully the steps in the process of doing this using Word. I look forward to the next part of his series, which will be on sorting and exporting index entries.

Ann Kingdom then provides a snapshot of how indexing societies have stepped up to the plate over the past year to provide virtual events for their members. A huge thank you to Ann for assembling this article, which involved reaching out to indexers worldwide to gather data about how online events have been organized, presented, and experienced by attendees. She not only captures this moment in time for us but offers lessons for the future in how to successfully prepare, implement, and participate in worthwhile and enjoyable online professional development. And on that note, while the conference calendar is looking a bit empty at this time of the year, with most of the indexing society conferences finished, we will bring you reports on those in the next issue. And in the meantime, please think ahead to the international conference and ICRIS triennial meeting in October 2022. As Ann notes in her article, most indexers are hoping for a mix of virtual and face-to-face events in the future, and here’s hoping that, by next year, we will be able to rub shoulders once again in Berlin.
