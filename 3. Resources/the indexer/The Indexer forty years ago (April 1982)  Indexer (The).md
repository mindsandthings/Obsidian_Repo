## Abstract

Hazel Bell, editor of _The Indexer_ from 1978 to 1995, reflects on the content of the journal 40 years ago. In this issue, she travels back to April 1982. This feature will continue in future issues of the journal. If you would like to look further back in time, we recommend reading the regular feature that ran from 1991 to 2008 – ‘_The Indexer_ thirty years ago’ – which covered issues of the journal between 1961 and 1978.

_The Indexer_ issue of April 1982 (Volume 13, number 1) had 72 pages.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.9#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> Like the previous issue (see [Bell, 2021](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.9#core-R1)), it was much concerned with the steady advance of the computer. Indeed, its guest editorial, by Judy Batchelor, was headed, ‘Letter to a computer from a free-lance book-indexer’. This began:

> I hear on all sides that you and I will be working together a great deal in the future, so I thought it might be pleasant and perhaps useful to get acquainted …

It went on to reflect on the differences between the two parties (‘You are not self-programming … _my_ central processor … is inclined to be strong on the seven deadly sins … Central processor/brain; memory/shoebox; these are analogies that work only so far’); consider potential advantages and disadvantages (‘time will be saved … the level of concentration may be higher; a machine … has no idea of concept or synonym …’); and to express the hope that ‘between us we may achieve more often than I ever can alone a really good index: the perfectly angled array of windows between the author’s mind and the reader’s’. What a splendid definition of a good index!

The first article, Hans H. Wellisch’s ‘More on indexes in encyclopedias (and on one encyclopedia index)’, constituted an addendum to his ‘“Indexes” and “Indexing” in encyclopedias’ published in the April 1981 _Indexer_ (Volume 12, number 3). In this latter he had surveyed the treatment of the subjects ‘index’ and ‘indexing’ in 33 encyclopedias of various types, finding it ‘quite uneven and in most instances not up to date’, and suggesting that the ‘Societies of Indexers should make efforts to improve this situation’. Now in the April 1982 _Indexer_ he examined entries for those subjects in a further two encyclopedias, and the index of one, finding further ‘glaring mistakes, redundancies, misprints, and most of all omissions of information’.

Outstanding in this issue is a 20-page illustrated article, ‘The unconventional index and its merits’, by William S. Heckscher. The abstract reads,

> An index is customarily regarded as an arrangement of signposts pointing the way to alphabetically analysed textual content, but may effectively serve more imaginative purposes: to relieve the text of overburdening detail, to replace footnotes, to sharpen the perspective of the text, to supplement as well as elucidate textual content. Above all, it may be made so readable that one may begin with the index, deriving from it such pleasure as will stimulate eagerness to turn back to the text, perhaps piecemeal rather than as a continuous whole.

The article recounted Heckscher’s preparation of an index to an essay analysing Albrecht Dürer’s engraving _Melencolia I_, written in Latin in 1541 by Joachim Camerarius the Elder. Heckscher also translated and edited the essay. He writes, ‘I realised that I had to offer to my readers conclusions regarding the meaning of Dürer’s Melencolia’, and ‘to unburden my text’ he incorporated some of his exegesis into the index, which ‘should stand more or less on its own and yet present a mirror-image to the Text, relieving it of small but essential detail that might have overburdened the Text’. Further, he writes,

> My ambition went perhaps even higher: I intended the index to carry an independent theme … I had at times a feeling … that I was … working out challenging problems of counterpoint.

Heckscher’s final paragraph reiterated his conception of the unconventional index, concluding,

> I prefer the index which has a life of its own, which may pride itself on being the child of imagination, and which should enable us to spend a peaceful evening in bed, reading such an index, as if we were reading a good novel.

This ideal has been much quoted in the succeeding decades.

Returning to the computer theme, A. Campbell Purton provided five pages on ‘Microcomputers for home indexing: a report and guide’, on their use as an aid for the freelance indexer, hardware and software requirements, and the choice of suitable systems. He considered in turn the keyboard; VDU; memory capacity; cassette recorders, floppy disc drives and floppy tapes; software; the printer; costs; advantages (‘The main advantage … is that it in principle saves time’); and future developments (‘optical character recognition of normal print is still at the development stage’). He foresaw the exchange of magnetic discs between indexer and publisher.

Four articles dealt with the indexing of specific large databases or collections:

•

Ann Edwards contributed four pages on indexing a new database – European Research Centres. This involved transferring large quantities of directory information onto a computer file. Concluding by considering the future place of the human indexer in electronic publishing, she averred: ‘However large the role of the computer becomes, there will still remain a need for the discretion and even the subjective judgement of the thinking indexer’.

•

Marion M. Stewart wrote about the Churchill College Archives Centre, describing its founding, design and work carried out there, with lists of the papers acquired.

•

Hilda M. Pearson provided two pages on ‘The Encyclopaedia of Islam and its index’, mentioning the method of working and difficulties encountered, including a facsimile page of the index published.

•

Joachim Thuss reported on ‘Indexing international biomedical literature’.

John Gordon, then chairman of the Society of Indexers and passionate about indexing standards (as recounted in [Kingdom, 2022](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.9#core-R2)), vehemently denounced ‘the most astonishingly inept index I have ever seen in print’, a ‘horrendous travesty’ which, he wrote, the laws of libel prohibited him from identifying. He wondered, ‘Would the cause of good book indexing be advanced if the publisher could be legally called to account under the Trade Descriptions Act? After all “**INDEX**” is printed in bold caps at the head of this pitiful mish-mash’.

A page on ‘_The Indexer_ since 1958’ briefly reviewed the contents of the journal through its first twelve volumes, noting distinguished contributors, specialized subjects, and lighter items.

Judy Batchelor reported on a panel discussion meeting, ‘Publishers’ problems’. This considered authors’ contracts with regard to indexes, and relations with indexers; copyright in indexes; translation; revision for paperback editions; and, of course, the future use of home computers. The report concluded, ‘The chairman \[John Gordon\]’s hope that we might “dig a new patch” was largely justified, at the end of a voluble and fruitful evening’.

Helping to cement links within the international indexing community, this was the first _Indexer_ issue to include a summary of the newsletters of what were then the ‘four affiliated societies’: the American Society of Indexers (ASI), the Australian Society of Indexers (AusSI), the Indexing and Abstracting Society of Canada (IASC/SCAD) and the Society of Indexers (SI). The IASC _Bulletin_ had recently ceased to be bilingual; SI’s newsletter had recently dealt with a new procedure for applying for admission to the Register and a newly structured (classified) members’ list.

The ‘Indexes past’ series continued in this issue, with quotes from the prefatory note to and extracts from the ‘Full index of names, topics and opinions’ to _The life of Samuel Johnson_ and _The journal of a tour to the Hebrides_ by James Boswell (in the 1900 volume published by Sands & Company). This was reported to show great vaingloriousness, with sneers at fellow indexers. The ‘Indexers in fiction’ series considered those portrayed in Barbara Pym’s novel _No fond return of love._

Of four ‘Letters to the editor’, two referred to cookery book indexing, one to the article on archaeological indexing in the previous issue (by the article’s author), and one, from Hans Wellisch, was a sequel to a protracted chain of correspondence (three references are given in a footnote) deriving from his article in the October 1980 _Indexer_ (Volume 12, number 2), ‘The alphabetization of prepositions in indexes’. He had there contended, as fiercely as ever, that if prepositions and conjunctions appeared at the beginning of subheadings they should be alphabetized:

> The tasks of compiler and user alike need not be complicated unnecessarily by pseudo-alphabetical arrangements that are intelligible only to their inventors … The antiquated and dysfunctional rule to disregard prepositions and conjunctions in the alphabetization of entries should be eliminated … ([Wellisch, 1980](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.9#core-R3): 92)

In the April 1981 Letters column, both John Gordon and Anthony Raven had challenged Wellisch’s contention, while in October 1981 (p. 201) Geoff Dixon had weighed in, supporting Wellisch, and asserting,

> The craft of indexing has been bedevilled by the idiosyncratic practices of individual indexers who refuse to accept sensible standardization …

In his full-page letter in the April 1982 _Indexer_, Wellisch reviewed this sequence in characteristic style, beginning,

> I find it difficult to believe that my plea for strict alphabetization of all words in index entries … should have been misunderstood by all but one of those who reacted to it. It seems that when cherished beliefs and old habits are being challenged … the blood of some indexers begins to boil until they, blinded by rage and indignation, are unable to read what has been set down on paper or to listen to rational arguments.

As this exchange of views demonstrated, if leading members of the profession could not agree on issues of this kind, what hope was there for achieving consistency in the indexes to _The Indexer_ itself (see [Kingdom, 2022](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.9#core-R2))?<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.9#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup>

The ‘Indexes reviewed’ section comprised two pages of ‘Indexes praised’, three examples of ‘Two cheers!’, a column of ‘Indexes censured’, two and a half columns of ‘Indexes omitted’, and a ‘Tailpiece’.

During this period of _The Indexer_’s history, book reviews were an important feature. In this issue 22 books were reviewed and another 17 listed under the heading ‘Publications received and publications noted’. The first review was by John Gordon, considering the actual essay ‘Melancholia’ by Joachim Camerarius, of which William Heckscher recounted the translating, editing and indexing in the first article in this issue.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.9#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup> Gordon seemed to be overwhelmed by this ‘subtly orchestrated opus’, and made much reference in his review to Heckscher’s index, ‘which probes beyond the generally accepted limits of indexing theory and practice … a voyage of exploration into uncharted areas of technique’. Four reviews were concerned with computers and electronic publishing. Reviewing _The future of the printed word_, edited by Philip Hills, A. C. Purton noted that ‘among the topics discussed are the use of word processors by authors and publishers, computer-assisted printing techniques, the use of video-discs for data storage, publication by microform and full electronic publishing’), while he concluded his review of _New technology and developments in the communication of research during the 1980s_ (by A. J. Meadows) by stating, ‘I would have thought that … a “primary communications research centre” would supply its publications with indexes; alas, it does not’. Geoff Dixon also pointed out that _Man and society: automated information processing_ (edited by Harold W. Lawson) was unindexed. Philip Bradley reviewed _Poetry and the computer: some quantitative aspects of the style of Sylvia Plath_ by C. S. Butler, noting that

> Butler distinguishes between a ‘computational stylistician and literary critic …’ Butler uses TTR or type-token ratio … This is the measuring of vocabulary richness by means of the number of different words (word-types) in relation to the total number of words (word-tokens). The COCOA (COunt and COncordance on Atlas) program used was ideal for this purpose.

L. M. Harrod, reviewing _The ALA yearbook: a review of library events 1980_, looked back to Wellisch’s article on indexes in encyclopedias at the beginning of this issue, writing at the end of his review,

> May I take this opportunity of mentioning, in connection with Professor Wellisch’s reference to the meaning of pre-and post-coordinate indexes not being defined in the _Academic American Encyclopaedia_, that both these and other forms of indexing are described in my _Librarians’ glossary and reference book_ published in the US by the Westfield Press and in the UK by the Gower Publishing Co. Ltd, of Andover.

An opportunity seized indeed!

It was rare to see expanses of white paper during this time, and the 18 ‘fillers’ in this issue included announcements of conferences; publications by Aslib, BSI, EC, INSPEC and UDC; a plea by the indexer of Volume 12 of _The Indexer_ for comment following use of it, with six particular questions (it went unanswered);<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.9#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup> and:

> _The Guinness book of records_ (28th ed., 1982) cites under the heading, Longest index: The Ninth Collective Index of _Chemical Abstracts_ completed on 23 Aug 1978 contains 20.55 million entries in 95,882 pages and 57 volumes and weighs 251 lb 113.8 kg.

This _Indexer_ also contained advertisements: a quarter-page for FARESTEAD associates – Indexers of Information, and a full page for European Research Centres, the subject of Ann Edwards’s article. The back cover shows quarter-page advertisements for the SI Register and the indexing correspondence course of the Rapid Results College, and a half-page advertisement for _The Indexer_ itself, as all issues of the previous two volumes did.

## Editor’s note

Hazel notes the previous lack of white space in _The Indexer_ due to the use of ‘fillers’ at the ends of articles, which are no longer a regular feature of the journal. While we do still include advertisements, these are now set more prominently as full pages in keeping with the scholarly journal style of our publishers, Liverpool University Press. And our longer production cycle makes the inclusion of conference announcements and other time-sensitive material difficult. Fortunately, there are many other sources of up-to-date news on indexing society websites and in their newsletters, so _The Indexer_ no longer has to fill that role. For those reasons, you will see much more white space in modern issues of _The Indexer._ However, we are always willing to consider shorter items for publication, in addition to more substantial articles, while topical snippets about indexing will sometimes find a home in the ‘Indexes reviewed’ section.

## Footnotes

2

Wellisch had alluded to the indexes to _The Indexer_, admiring the style used in Volume 11 in relation to prepositions and hoping that it would be followed consistently in subsequent _Indexer_ indexes (it wasn’t).

3

_The essay was included in_ Joachim Camerarius (1500–1574): essays on the history of humanism during the Reformation _published by Wilhelm Fink._
