Publication: The Indexer: The International Journal of Indexing

Volume 39, Number 4

These extracts from reviews do not pretend to represent a complete survey of all reviews in journals and newspapers. We offer only a selection from quotations that readers have sent in. Our reproduction of comments is not a stamp of approval from _The Indexer_ upon the reviewer’s assessment of an index. Extracts are arranged alphabetically under the names of publishers, within the sections: Indexes praised; Two cheers!; Indexes censured; Indexes omitted.

## Indexes praised

**Allen Lane**: _Index, a history of the_, by Dennis Duncan (2021, 352 pp, £20). Rev. by Michael Delgado, _Prospect_, 26 August 2021.

Nowhere in this book is the importance of the human indexer more apparent than in its own index, compiled by Paula Clarke Bain, which is a nest of metatextual easter eggs. The entry for ‘wild goose chase’ tells us to ‘see chase, wild goose’ (not dissimilar from the teenage Lewis Carroll’s playful index to his own handwritten journal, which had entries for ‘General, Things in, 25,’ ‘In General, Things, 25’ and ‘Things in General, 25’). Under ‘Indexers’ we have the subheading ‘veneration of,’ with an editorial interjection: ‘\[and quite right too\].’ And if we hadn’t quite got the message, her entry for ‘bad indexes’ tells us to ‘_see also_ automated indexing.’ Go to ‘automated indexing,’ and the two subheadings read ‘attempts to index like a human 254’ and ‘fails 304–7.’

\[_Paula Clarke Bain is a member of SI._\]

**A & M University Press**: _Wildlife ecology and management in Mexico_, by Raul Valdez and Jose A. Ortega-Santos (2019, 420 pp, £65.95). Rev. by David G. Hewitt, _Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America_, **101**(1), January 2020.

An eight-page index will help readers find references to topics and species of interest, and a two-page list of acronyms is helpful, especially for the many agencies in the Mexican government.

**Armchair Traveller at the Bookhaus**: _Walking Pepys’s London_, by Jacky Colliss Harvey (2021, 220 pp, £12.99). Rev. by John Phipps, _Times Literary Supplement_, 30 July 2021.

The writing is crisp, the directions are clear, the maps are usable; it even includes a short index. At 150 pages, it is as good a book of its kind as one could hope for, and I urge anyone with a fondness for Pepys to buy it.

**John Benjamins**: _Intertextuality in practice_, by Jessica Mason (2019, 204 pp, £83). Rev. by Kimberley Pager-McClymont, _Language and Literature_, **30**(2).

… the volume provides clear definitions of the relevant concepts needed to understand the framework. They are signposted and formatted into boxes to stand out, however, no glossary is offered at the end, although there is a detailed index.

**Cambridge University Press**: _Social avalanche: crowds, cities and financial markets_, by Christian Borch (2020, 290 pp, £74.99). Rev. by Roar Hagen, _Acta Sociologica_, **64**(3).

The arguments are clear, the book is well organized into chapters and sections and includes an elaborate index.

**William Collins**: _In the thick of it: the private diaries of a minister_, by Alan Duncan (2021, 512 pp, £25). Rev. by Sudhir Hazareesingh, _Times Literary Supplement_, 25 June 2021.

… the gloriously acerbic Brexit-era diaries of this principled and humane Tory grandee. The Index entries are a joy in themselves: Michael Gove has several under the heading ‘seriously deficient’, and the ones for Boris Johnson include ‘egotistical showman’ and (my favourite) ‘bluff and bluster routine’.

**Frontline**: _Winston Churchill’s illnesses, 1886–1965_, by Allister Vale and John Scadding (2020, xx + 522 pp, £30/$52.95). Rev. by Antoine Capet, _Cercles: Revue pluridisciplinaire du monde anglophone_, May 2021.

… the copious Index is exemplary, giving the names of diseases and drugs as well as people and places.

\[_Index by SI member Christopher Phipps_.\]

**InterVarsity Press**: _The learning cycle: insights for faithful teaching from neuroscience and the social sciences_, by Muriel L. Elmer and Duane H. Elmer (2020, 240 pp, $22). Rev. by Rhonda M. McEwen, _International Journal of Christianity & Education_, **0**(0), 1–2.

The helpful summaries at the conclusion of each chapter highlight key ideas and practical implications that will be useful to the reader. And the extensive bibliography and author/subject index are welcome resources that attest to the depth of research which undergirds this text.

**Oxford University Press**: _Openness to creative destruction_, by Arthur M. Diamond Jr (2019, 304 pp, £2.99). Rev. by Charles Oppenheim, _Prometheus_, **36**(1), March 2020.

This is a well-written book with an easy style that will appeal to economists, students and perhaps the general public. It is supported by a large number of references, as well as figures and tables. It has an exemplary index.

**Oxford University Press**: _The Oxford handbook of Johannine studies_, ed. by Judith M. Lieu and Martinus C. de Boer (2018, xvi + 469 pp, $122). Rev. by Olegs Andrejevs, _Biblical Theology Bulletin_, **50**.

The volume concludes with a 32-page index, containing an Index locorum and a general index. Note that the latter includes contemporary authors.

**Pegasus**: _The lost girls: love and literature in wartime London_, by D. J. Taylor (400 pp, $28.95). Rev. by Andrew Stuttaford, _New Criterion_, February 2020.

A book’s index can amuse as well as inform, and in D.J. Taylor’s _Lost Girls_, a lively, perceptive, and gossip-strewn inquiry into an overlooked aspect of an influential corner of London’s literary life in, mainly, the 1940s, the index does not disappoint. Turning from ‘_Horizon_, “bugger incident,”’ to the entries for that storied magazine’s creator and presiding genius, ‘Connolly, Cyril,’ we find, among other accolades, ‘capriciousness,’ ‘dilettante quality,’ ‘double standards and hypocrisy,’ ‘mother-fixation,’ ‘self-absorption,’ ‘self-destructiveness,’ ‘self-propagating mystique,’ ‘sulkiness,’ ‘tactlessness,’ and, in a final jab of the indexer’s finger, ‘vacillation and procrastination.’

**Princeton University Press**: _The art of Bible translation_, by Robert Alter (2019, xvi + 127 pp, $24.95 (hbk), $14.95 (pbk)). Rev. by Andrew C. Sloan, _Anglican Theological Review_, 2021, **103**(3).

The index makes cross referencing \[Alter’s\] translation and commentary and this volume easy and seamless.

**Routledge**: _Trauma-informed supervision: core components and unique dynamics in varied practice contexts_, ed. by Carolyn Knight and L. Dianne Borders (2020, 253 pp, £120.00 (hbk), £36.99 (pbk), £36.99 (ebook)). Rev. by Ann Dix, _Dramatherapy_, 1–2.

This is an academic book which will be primarily used by researchers and those looking for papers on specific client groups. It has a comprehensive index and is clearly laid out, although there are some editing errors.

**Routledge**: _Writing lives together: Romantic and Victorian auto/biography_, ed. by Felicity James and Julian North (2018, x + 148 pp, $155.00, $49.95 (pbk), £125.00, £36.99 (pbk)). Rev. by Carol Hanbery MacKay, _Victorian Studies_, **62**(3), Spring 2020.

_Writing Lives Together_ was originally published as a 2017 special issue of the online journal _Life Writing_, and several of its chapters originated in papers delivered at ‘Writing Lives Together: A Conference on Romantic and Victorian Biography,’ conducted by North and James at Leicester University in 2015. The hardcopy text requests that citations be made to the original pagination for each article, which it lists following the book’s table of contents. The advantage of working with the book lies primarily with its index, but free access to the online articles may well make this modality the scholar’s choice.

**Sacristy Press**: _Like there’s no tomorrow_, by Frances Ward (2020, 254 pp, £12.99). Rev. by Lucy Johnson, _Green Christian_, Autumn 2020.

It is chatty without being preachy, as well as containing an admirable index and notes for the more scholarly amongst us.

**Self-published**: _Northampton, 5,000 years of history_, by Mike Ingram (2020, 327 pp, £19.99). Rev. in _Northampton Chronicle and Echo_, 13 July 2021.

Twelve of the county’s best loved cultural experiences have been honoured at the Northamptonshire Heritage Forum awards – the Oscars of local heritage.

**Hindsight Award for best published work won by Northampton, 5,000 years of history by Mike Ingram**. Exhaustively researched … tells the story of Northampton from its origins through to the 1970s. The judges said: ‘A solid read that includes a good index and glossary and an essential reference work for years to come.’

\[For another view, see below:\]

Enjoying this history of Northampton where my family came from. But the maps are too small – you need a magnifying glass to read the street names. And the index is useless. It doesn’t mention the name of Lawrence Washington for example, ancestor of the first President of the USA. Names are listed by Christian name rather than surname, Kings are all King Henry II and churches under St John’s etc. Very inadequate.

## Two cheers!

**Faber**: _Mozart: the reign of love_, by Jan Swafford (2020, 832 pp, £30). Rev. by Paul Griffiths, _Times Literary Supplement_, 18 June 2021.

Within two years \[Mozart\] had written himself another piano concerto in C, K. 503. (Swafford’s index is a model of thoroughness, but it slips up where this work is concerned.)

## Indexes censured

**Boekengilde**: _Blauwebrieven: Indischeontrechting_, by Henk Harcksen (2019, 149 pp, €24.95). Rev. by Harry A. Poeze, _Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde_, **176**(2–3), 2020.

The book’s index is almost unusable, as it arranges its entries by first names.

**Rowman & Littlefield**: _Jefferson’s White House: Monticello on the Potomac_, by James B. Conroy (2019, 328 pp, $27). Rev. by William C. Digiacomantonio, _Washington History_, **33**(1), Spring 2021.

Don’t bother looking up ‘Tertium Quids’ in the book’s index; the phenomenon is not cited there. Neither are ‘Bible,’ ‘Religion,’ or ‘Christianity’ – leaving Jefferson’s ideas about ‘holy writ’ buried among paragraphs itemizing the amount, variety, and vintages of wine. That is an example of how, with the exception of some excellent illustrations (floorplans and conjectural elevations), this volume’s editorial apparatus fails the reader. Readers will be frustrated by arbitrary index entries and incomplete page citations.

**University of North Carolina Press**: _City of a million dreams: a history of New Orleans at Year 300_, by Jason Berry (2018, 424 pp, $35). Rev. by James D. Wilson Jr, _Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association_, **61**(3), Summer 2020.

There are, as well, copyedit distractions: historian John E. Harkins is correctly referenced early in the text, yet transforms into John E. Hoskins in later references, while the index entries are hit-or-miss at best. These issues, however, pale in the shadow of Berry’s splendid, character-driven prose.

## Indexes omitted

**Abingdon**: _Wisdom literature_, by Samuel E. Balentine (2018, xiii + 190 pp, $29.99). Rev. by David J. Zucker, _Biblical Theology Bulletin_, **51**(30).

While an index would have enhanced the utilization of the book, there are endnotes and each chapter closes with suggestions for further reading.

**Bad Apple Press**: _A long view from the left_, by Max Ogden (2020, 239 pp, $26.75). Rev. by Russell D. Lansbury, _Journal of Industrial Relations_, **63**(3).

One minor quibble is the lack of an index to assist the reader to locate the many names and subjects mentioned in the book.

**bhc**: _The wandering Palestinian_, by Anan Ameri (2020, 239 pp, $15.95). Rev. by Janice J. Terry, _Arab Studies Quarterly_, **43**(2), Spring 2021.

Although the memoir does not include an index, there is a useful glossary and endnotes.

**Black Inc**: _Solved! How other countries have cracked the world’s biggest problems and we can too_, by Andrew Wear (2020, 324 pp, £18.05, AU$29.99 (pbk)). Rev. by Allan Borowski, _Journal of Social Work_, 1–2.

In sum, _Solved!_ is a very good book written by an accomplished wordsmith (a detailed index would have made it even better).

**Cape**: _Languages of truth: essays 2003–2020_, by Salman Rushdie (2021, 368 pp, £19.99). Rev. by Nick Lezard, _The Spectator_, 10 July 2021.

There is no index, which I always think is, in a book of literary criticism, a bit of an insult to the general reader, never mind the critic.

**Century Publications**: _Comparative political systems_, by M. Emdadul Haq (2019, xiii + 258 pp). Rev. by Saleh Shahriar, _South Asia Research_, **41**(2).

The book contains colourful pictures, cartoons and figures (pp. 243–58). However, the author should also have provided an index.

**Christians Aware and the Melanesian Mission**: _Seeking peace in the Pacific: the story of conflict and Christianity in the Central Solomon Islands_, by Brian Macdonald-Milne (2020, 222 pp, £10). Rev. by Robin Sherman, _Christians Aware_, Summer 2021.

This book will be of more interest to the Social Historian than the Postal Historian but, unfortunately, in the absence of an index, it will be rather difficult to locate the appropriate references.

**HarperCollins**: _Perversion of justice: the Jeffrey Epstein story_, by Julie K. Brown (2021, 464 pp, £17.99). Rev. by Melanie Reid, _The Australian_, 27 July 2021.

The one thing this book lacks is an index, but often authors have to fund these themselves. Under the circumstances Julie K. Brown can be forgiven.

**Manilla Press**: _The future we choose: surviving the climate crisis_, by Christiana Figueres and Tome Rivett-Carnac (2020, 225 pp, £12.99). Rev. by John Smith, _Green Christian_, Autumn 2020.

My only regret is that it has no index, which would have considerably enhanced the value of this important text.

**Monthly Review Press**: _Navigating the zeitgeist: a story of the Cold War, the New Left, Irish republicanism, and international Communism_, by Helena Sheehan (2019, 310 pp, €25.00). Rev. by Anthony Coughlan, _History Ireland_, **28**(1), January–February 2020.

Irish readers will home in on \[some\] aspects of her story, but inexplicably Monthly Review Press, whose production values are usually of the highest, has omitted an index, so that one must read the text through to find them. That is easy, though, for Dr Sheehan writes very well … I look forward to her second volume – desirably this time with an index to both.

**Oxford University Press**: _Rethinking America: from empire to republic_, by John M. Murrin (2018, ix + 407 pp, $34.95). Rev. by John J. Gurner, _Army History_, 119, Spring 2021.

It lacks an index, and there are noticeable typographical errors in a few chapters.

**Pen & Sword Military**: _U.S. infantry weapons of the Second World War: rare photographs from wartime archives_, by Michael Green (2015, 189 pp, $24.95). Rev. by Jody Fraser, _Army History_, Fall 2020.

Although the book has few shortcomings, it does not have an index.

**Penguin Classics**: _The anatomy of melancholy_, by Robert Burton, ed. by Angus Gowland (2021, 1376 pp, £40). Rev. by Philip Hensher, _The Spectator_, 7 August 2021.

This is a clean, readable version, with some helpful explanatory notes by Angus Gowland. Scholars might have preferred more emphasis on Burton’s sources rather than rudimentary explanations of ‘stalking horse’, for example, or ‘stare’ for ‘starling,’ a usage that was still current in W. B. Yeats. And an analytical index, though an enormous task, would have transformed our understanding of the book.

**Pickwick**: _Unspeakable things unspoken: an Irigarayan reading of otherness and victimization in Judges 19–21_, by Isabelle M. Hamley (2019, xiii + 256 pp, $32.00). Rev. by Helen Paynter, _Biblical Theology Bulletin_, **51**(30).

The book is well presented and the typeface is easy to read. I would, however, have appreciated at least a general index, and probably an index of authorities cited, in addition.

**Spectrum**: _De slavernij in Oost en West: Het Amsterdam-onderzoek_, ed. by Pepijn Brandon, Guno Jones, Nancy Jouwe and Matthias van Rossum (2020, 448 pp, €24.99). Rev. by Harry A. Poeze, _Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde_, 177 (2021).

The Amsterdam volume unfortunately lacks an index.

**Springer Nature Singapore Pte**: _Understanding social dynamics in South Asia: essays in memory of Ramkrishna Mukherjee_, ed. by P. N. Mukherji, N. Jayaram and B. N. Ghosh (280 pp. 124, €119.99 (hbk), €96.29 (ebook)). Rev. by Soundarya Iyer, _Progress in Development Studies_ 2021, **21**(3).

The lack of an index is a drawback for the reader, making it challenging to find mentions of key concepts in RM’s work in the book.

**Wallstein**: _Friedo Lampe: eine Biographie_, by Johann-Günther König (2020, 388 pp, €28.00). Rev. by Simon Beattie, _Times Literary Supplement_, 4 June 2021.

Given the wide-ranging coverage of the writer’s life, König’s biography would have benefited from the inclusion of an index. Nonetheless, this is a well-produced, intricately researched and important addition to our knowledge of Lampe …

## By the way…

**Weidenfeld & Nicolson**: _Invisible walls: a journalist in search of her life_, by Hella Pick (2021, 307 pp, £20.00). Rev. by Alex Brummer, _British Journalism Review_, **13**(2).

A scan of the index serves to remind journalists that when contacts and powerful people become friends, it can sometimes be harder to report faithfully on events. This memoir shows that, with charm and skill, the difficulty can be bridged with aplomb.

**White Rabbit**: _Monument maker_, by David Keenan (£25.00). Rev. by Stuart Kelly, _The Guardian_, 7 August 2021.

Of the ambition, intelligence and provocation of David Keenan’s mammoth _Monument Maker_ there can be no doubt. Whether a majority of readers will enjoy the experience is another matter entirely … It is structured as a cathedral, the reader moving through books entitled ‘Nave’, ‘Transept’, ‘Apse’ and ‘Choir’. The final pages are an index of every single character in the book. This is funny – look at the definition of King Herod, ‘wanted Jesus dead’, or ‘CIA – never the CIA’. The novel is built of interlocking novels, and is both intertextual and metatextual in making reference to Keenan’s other novels. Some readers may wish to track down the references – others may feel they are being played with out of authorial grandiosity. \[_So more of a glossary than an index?_\]
