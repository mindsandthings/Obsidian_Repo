Volume 40, Number 1

These extracts from reviews do not pretend to represent a complete survey of all reviews in journals and newspapers. We offer only a selection from quotations that readers have sent in. Our reproduction of comments is not a stamp of approval from _The Indexer_ upon the reviewer’s assessment of an index. Extracts are arranged alphabetically under the names of publishers, within the sections: Indexes praised; Two cheers!; Indexes censured; Indexes omitted.

## Indexes praised

**Allen Lane**: _Index, a history of the_, by Dennis Duncan (2021, 352 pp, £20). Rev. by James Waddell, _Times Literary Supplement_, 10 September 2021.

Like a cartographer preparing a map, a good indexer must have a clear sense of the terrain, the imagined user, and what they need to find their way. To illustrate this point, Duncan includes two indexes in his own book, one by a professional indexer and the other by a software programme. The computerized version is a headache-inducing jumble; ‘afoot’ and ‘absolutely necessary’ are given their own entries, and important subjects are notable by their absence. In contrast, the index by Paula Clarke Bain is a joy, full of selfreferential gags: under ‘jokes’, we are rightly directed to ‘this index, passim’.

**ICS Publications**: _Listening to Edith Stein: wisdom for a new century_, ed. by Kathleen Haney (2018, 456 pp, £25). Rev. by Peter Tyler, _Mount Carmel: A Review of the Spiritual Life_, 69(3), July–September 2021.

The book is well produced and edited, containing an excellent index (fast disappearing from contemporary books) and a good bibliography of Stein’s work at the end.

**Oxford University Press**: _Technical editing: an introduction to editing in the workplace_, by Donald H. Cunningham, Edward A. Malone and Joyce M. Rothschild (2019, 592 pp, $68.92). Rev. by Alan Houser, _IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication_, **64**(4), December 2021.

The book includes a thorough 30-page glossary of grammar terms, 33 pages of notes and references, and a thorough index.

## Indexes censured

**Columbia University Press**: _The Belle Époque: a cultural history, Paris and beyond_, by Dominique Kalifa, tr. by Susan Emanuel (2021, 264 pp, £25). Rev. by Brendan King, _Times Literary Supplement_, 8 October 2021.

That Kalifa was not involved in seeing the translation of his book through to press may account in some degree for the regrettable errors that have crept into the English edition.

Although the translation itself, by Susan Emanuel, is very readable, a mass of minor proofing errors and inconsistencies lets the book down. The editors can’t decide whether to use French or English titles, and end up with a hotchpotch of both. Some French titles are given English translations, others not. Then there is the sporadic use of French accents (Belle Époque, but Ecole des femmes), erratic conventional forms (‘Le Matin’, but ‘the Gaulois’), indexing gaffes (the nineteenth-century curator of the Galliera Museum, Henri Clouzot, is confused with his twentieth-century nephew, the director and photographer Henri-Georges Clouzot, for example), and textual glitches that weren’t present in the French original.

## Indexes omitted

**Perfect Text**: _Endangered species: diplomacy from the passenger seat_, by Margaret Bullard (2021, 208 pp, £25). Rev. by Matthew Parris, _The Spectator_, 25 September 2021.

The book has arrived – and I cannot put it down. It would have merited professional editing, an index, footnotes and photographs; but nothing can spoil a sharp, funny, unsparing account of diplomatic life … \[_So that’s all right, then_.\]

**Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery**: _Paradise Lost: Thomas Griffiths Wainewright_, by Jane Stewart with Peter Hughes and Jacobus van Breda (2021, 200 pp, AU$30). Rev. by David Hansen, _Times Literary Supplement_, 8 October 2021.

Perhaps most importantly, the volume incorporates an ambitious _catalogue raisonné_, a timeline detailing key events in the life of the artist and a useful bibliography, though for some reason the listing is not chronological, there are careless cataloguing errors and some missing (though known) images, and the absence of an index or of any kind of pictorial finding aid is frustrating.

## By the way…

**Hendrickson Academic**: _Scripture index to rabbinic literature_, ed. by Caleb T. Friedeman et al. (2021, xvi + 549 pp, $59.95). Rev. by Jason Maston, _Religious Studies Review_, **47**(3), September 2021.

The rabbinic literature presents scholars with numerous problems. The sheer mass of material spread across multiple authoritative translations makes it difficult to trace how ideas are developed or, in the case of the present volume, scripture texts are interpreted. This volume draws together every scripture text identified by the editors and translators of the standard English translations into a single volume. Working with texts that come from the second to seventh centuries, Friedeman and his team identify approximately 90,000 references. This enables scholars to see where a text is referenced across the entire spectrum of rabbinic texts without having to check the index of every single translation. The Introduction explains the method used and provides a brief introduction to each text … This volume is a remarkable achievement and opens up new possibilities of engaging with this literature.

**Saraband**: _Case study_, by Graeme Macrae Burnet (2021, 276 pp, £14.99). Rev. by Allan Massie, _The Scotsman_, 9 October 2021.

Graeme Macrae Burnet is a master of the false but apparently authentic document. There are five lengthy ones in this, his fourth novel, intercut by a likewise credibly invented biographical sketch of a briefly famous, or rather notorious, psychotherapist, Collins Braithwaite, ‘a contemporary of RD Laing, and something of an “enfant terrible” of the so-called anti-psychiatry movement of the 1960s.’ … There is comedy here too. Indeed, depending on the angle of view, Braithwaite is a comic character, if also a disturbing one. Certainly in his depiction of him, Macrae Burnet catches the self-satisfied idiocy of one strand of 1960s culture. Indeed, he is done so well and seems so authentic in his inauthenticity that you might be surprised to find no mention of him in the index of John Clay’s admirable biography of Ronnie Laing.\*

\[\*_R. D. Laing: a biography_, by John Clay (Hodder & Stoughton, 1996)\]

**Simon & Schuster UK**: _Peril_, by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa (2021, 506 pp, £20). Rev. by John Williams, _New York Times_, 21 September 2021.

The former New York mayor \[Rudy Giuliani\] becomes a more prominent player here than in the previous books. (One especially brutal set of consecutive entries for him in the index reads: ‘hair dye incident,’ ‘hospitalized with coronavirus’).

**Weidenfeld & Nicolson**: _Monica Jones, Philip Larkin and me: her life and long loves, by John Sutherland (2021, 288 pp, £14.99). Rev. in Information Professional, September 2021._

Alan Bullimore has been in touch about the book, to say: ‘Considering his long career in libraries, this aspect of \[Larkin’s\] career does not feature greatly in works about his life. John Sutherland’s _Monica Jones, Philip Larkin and me_ does at least feature a 1960s photo of Monica sitting on a desk in the college library. The index however contains more entries for Ringo Starr than Melvil Dewey.’

## In praise of indexes

\[_In its issue of 18 November 2021, the_ London Review of Books _published as many as five letters about indexing on its letters page_.\]

Anthony Grafton’s account of the rise of the index describes John Foxe’s printed blank commonplace book, first published in 1557, as ‘riding a wave’ (LRB, 23 September). That is being charitable: Foxe could also be accused of running a lucrative scam. In its expanded versions, his book consisted of a folio of six hundred leaves, each of which contained (on the recto side) printed headings, with the rest of the pages being completely blank, allowing purchasers to insert pithy quotations discovered in their reading. The book was then tied to a printed index in its final pages. In theory, this would allow users to create their own searchable archive – an analogue storage and retrieval device.

But, as users expanded the archive by inserting further blank leaves, the index as a finding device soon proved useless. Foxe’s system was also rigidly Calvinist: what would a Catholic user have entered on the pages reserved for Absurditates in doctrina Pontificia (‘Absurdities in papal doctrine’)? It’s true that the Master of the Rolls, Sir Julius Caesar, used Foxe’s book over a period of sixty years. But he was the exception. Many users seem to have abandoned it once its conceptual and ideological flaws became apparent, often using it merely as a source of paper.

What’s more, Foxe’s folio was competing with compact, readily available storage devices which were cheap, portable and fully functional. Printed almanacs were produced in their thousands in the period, and not only contained a wealth of useful information (when to plant crops, dates of holidays, phases of the moon etc) but were often sold at provincial markets and fairs with blank interleaved pages on which to jot memoranda. In effect, Foxe had produced a non-functioning mainframe device for an elite market, while all around him ordinary people were already using inexpensive hand-held devices.

One troublesome use of indexes is their occasional weaponisation in academic feuds. A masterclass is provided by the Victorian medievalist J. H. Round, whose _Feudal England_ (1895) was in large part a sustained and vitriolic attack on his fellow medievalist E. A. Freeman. The entry devoted to ‘Freeman, Professor’ is by far the longest in the index, taking up one and a half columns of its eleven double-columned pages, and has sub-entries such as: ‘his contemptuous criticism’; ‘when himself in error’; ‘his “facts”’; ‘confuses individuals’; ‘his pedantry’; ‘misconstrues his Latin’; ‘his confused views’; ‘his special weakness’; ‘his Domesday errors and confusion’. The final sub-entry might seem somewhat superfluous: ‘necessity of criticising his work’. And all this when Freeman had died in 1892.

An example of the woes of indexing known to many paediatricians was mentioned in the _New York Times_ obituary of Waldo Nelson, author of the _Nelson Textbook of Paediatrics_, in March 1997.

> The book was a family affair. Dr Nelson would call out items from each page as his wife and three children wrote them down on index cards. The children were not eager to help, but Dr Nelson insisted that it was a contribution to their education. In humorous retribution, his daughter Ann introduced a line in the index. Under ‘birds, for the,’ she listed the entire book, pages 1–1413.

Nelson insisted that the entry was removed from subsequent editions.

Norbert Hirschhorn, Minneapolis, Minnesota

In _How to Make an Index_ (1902), Henry B. Wheatley, the founder of the Index Society, pointed to the dangers of a too-comprehensive index. William Prynne’s attack on the stage, _Histrio-Mastix_, might have escaped the notice of the attorney general had Prynne not supplied all the incriminating material in a convenient list. The entries include: ‘Devils, inventors and fomenters of stage plays’; ‘Heaven, no stage plays there’; ‘Herod Agrippa, smitten in theatre’; ‘Kings, infamous for them to act or frequent Playes’; ‘Plagues, occasioned by stage plays’; and, predictably, ‘Women actors, notorious whores’. The prosecutor quoted the index at Prynne’s trial.

Frances Post, London N10

For more than forty years I have been hoping for an opportunity to make the following index entry better known. It is from the _Monthly Review_, January–April 1802:

Interment, premature, of human bodies apparently dead, laudable institution for the prevention of, in Germany, 42.

Tony Lurcock, Oxford

## Short and sweet

‘Index entry’, the shortest of the very short stories for which the American writer Lydia Davis is best known, runs to just four words: ‘Christian, I’m not a’.

Anthony Cummins, interview with Lydia Davis, _The Observer_, 28 November 2021

## The hard life of indexers

James Waddell includes a reference to ‘the earliest surviving page-numbered manuscript, a 1470 printing of an otherwise unremarkable sermon’. Since a manuscript cannot be a printing, how would an indexer, if asked to index the review, handle this? Was it meant to illustrate the hard life of indexers?

G. T. Tanselle, Letters, _Times Literary Supplement_, 1 October 2021

## It ain’t necessarily so

I can confirm that one does indeed need a human indexer with a decent knowledge of the topic at hand (September 10). I thought I could safely ignore the index for my _Oxford Handbook of Christmas_ (2020), but when it came back with an entry on ‘Joseph, father of Jesus’, I knew I had to step in. Mercifully, it went to press as ‘Joseph, husband of Mary’. As to humour in indexes, one of my favourites is E. P. Sanders’s _Paul and Palestinian Judaism_ (1977). Its index has an entry for ‘Truth, ultimate’. The three pages listed under it lead one to the blank pages that divide the book’s parts.

Timothy Larsen, Letters, _Times Literary Supplement_, 1 October 2021

Timothy Larsen (Letters, October 1), writes that when he saw that the index of his _Oxford Handbook of Christmas_ included ‘Joseph, father of Jesus’ he knew he had to step in. The _Handbook_, Professor Larsen tells us, went to press with the entry changed to ‘Joseph, husband of Mary’. I can only assume he was telling us that God, and not Joseph, was Jesus’s father, as though it were an incontrovertible fact. Something like 30 per cent of the world’s population, at most, is Christian, and not even all of those people believe that Jesus was literally the Son of God. I hope Professor Larsen won’t be offended therefore if I point out that ‘the things that you’re liable / to read in the Bible, / it ain’t necessarily so’.
