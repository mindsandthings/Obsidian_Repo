It was a sad day for indexers worldwide when Hilary Calvert posted a short announcement on the MACREX international email list with the news that his wife Drusilla had passed away after more than five years suffering from the increasingly severe effects of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP, a rare progressive condition leading to problems with balance, movement, vision, speech and swallowing). With Drusilla’s passing the indexing community lost someone who had been at the forefront of the profession for almost four decades. Known worldwide along with Hilary for their pioneering work on indexing software, she was also a key figure in the Society of Indexers (SI), as testified by the Bernard Levin award (see [Figures 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.36#F1) and [2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.36#F2)). Equally importantly, however, we lost a very dear friend. We had got to know Drusilla well through many years serving on various SI committees, particularly while relaxing over post-meeting drinks. With her warmth, her infectious sense of humour and her zest for life, she was always great company, and several lifelong friendships developed.

Within hours of Hilary’s announcement, the MACREX list was flooded with condolences and tributes from around the world, and when the news reached the Society of Indexers, members were soon posting similar messages on the SI email forum, SIdeline. Everyone emphasized Drusilla’s kindness, patience and encouragement, especially when they were first getting to grips with the software, and mentioned their fond memories of happy times at conferences and workshops.

Brought up in Cambridge, Drusilla attended Cambridge High School for Girls, before going on to Girton College in 1963 to read Music and Anglo-Saxon. She and Hilary met on a University of Cambridge ski trip, getting to know each other better after the ski trip on a visit to Salzburg. With a postgraduate diploma in librarianship from University College London under her belt (plus SI’s four-day indexing course at London’s NorthWestern Polytechnic), she was well placed to embark on a freelance indexing career. This dovetailed well with her musical activities (playing and teaching the cello) and bringing up her three daughters, Jane, Catherine and Polly. Family was very important to Drusilla; she was totally devoted to Hilary and very proud of their daughters, whose lives we caught glimpses of in emails primarily about SI issues.

Indexing proved to be Drusilla’s main career, after briefly working in music publishing (including a stint at the Cambridge Music Shop) and travelling to Turkey and Iran to record folk music. She prepared her first index in the early 1970s, thanks to Hilary becoming aware that a set of medical conference proceedings needed indexing. Initially focusing on medical publications, over the years her indexing work ranged widely, from literary theory to sustainable development, with music an obvious specialism, and also many non-specialist books aimed at the general reader. As an incredibly good cook and very knowledgeable about food she also enjoyed indexing books on food and cookery. She loved indexing ‘for the discipline, linguistic challenges and association with people of like mind – indexers, editors and authors. There can be frustrations … but these pale into insignificance when set against the personal satisfaction of producing a meaningful guide to the contents of a book or journal’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.36#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup>

Within ten years Drusilla had abandoned the index cards and shoeboxes that were the traditional tools of the indexer in the 1970s and become a guinea pig for early versions of what subsequently became MACREX – the first widely available commercial indexing software. As [Geraldine Beare (2004)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.36#core-R2), interviewing Drusilla for _The Indexer_, explained, ‘for computers to work, software is needed, and before both Steve Jobs and Bill Gates made their spectacular entrances, two people started up an enterprise which enabled the indexing profession to move to the forefront of the technology of the time … Drusilla and Hilary Calvert’.

In early 1981 computers were very expensive, but as Drusilla explained in the same interview,

> Hilary wanted an excuse to buy a home computer because these were very expensive at the time. The deal was that he could do so provided he wrote a program to help with my indexing, and this is what happened. The first version was a RAM-based program which used about 8 kb of memory. The data was saved onto cassettes on an ancient cassette recorder. The computer, which cost £2500, was built from a kit. Later on a floppy disk was added for the cost of about £450.

From these small beginnings (the first version was called MICREX), today MACREX Version 9 includes a vast array of features, helping indexers to work more efficiently and providing options to suit the exacting requirements of different indexers and publishers. The early incarnations of MACREX were designed to run on machines with a fraction of the power we now have at our fingertips. But by devising a basic architecture that allowed the index to be divided into smaller batches for sorting, it was still possible to compile indexes with as many as 80,000 entries – quite an achievement at the time. Although not necessary on more powerful machines, this system was retained in later versions of the program to enable really enormous indexes to be prepared.

Developing the software was a time-consuming business, taking up many evenings and weekends in the Calvert household in the early years, and with each new version of MACREX more features were added and existing features improved. Much of Drusilla’s time was devoted not only to marketing the software and preparing the documentation, but also to running demonstrations and workshops. The very first demonstration at an SI members’ meeting in 1981 attracted unprecedented interest and MACREX sessions became a regular feature of conferences until 2015 (the last conference Drusilla was able to attend). Before long, MACREX featured in indexing conferences in Australia, Canada and the US, as well as in Britain and mainland Europe. MACREX agents were appointed in the US (Nancy Mulvany and later Gale Rhoades, who provided additional technical expertise) and Australia (Max McMaster, who remembers Drusilla informing him at a conference that as an existing MACREX user, he was now the Australian agent!). Needless to say, this was much more than a convenient business arrangement, with Nancy, Gale and Max becoming firm friends with the Calverts.

Many MACREX developments were in response to users’ requests and Drusilla played a key role not only in running workshops but also in providing a well-used and much-appreciated helpline. And among the tributes following Drusilla’s death, one grateful SI member commented, ‘whatever time of day it was, it seemed she was always there, ready to answer my questions and offer guidance’. Another remembered attending a one-to-one tutorial with Drusilla that was ‘a great joy’ and that ‘she was a wonderful teacher, endlessly patient and encouraging’.

Drusilla and Hilary were very much a partnership, working together to develop the software – a perfect marriage of indexing skills and programming expertise. Hilary was seen at SI conferences almost as often as Drusilla, and they both always made time to help and support people with indexing queries and issues. As Ann Hudson commented on the MACREX international list, ‘Both of you have continued to support me through various hardware and software problems over the years. A truly personal service and much appreciated.’ And Maureen MacGlashan was not alone in having had ‘so many happy memories of the two, always the two of you, at conferences and workshops’. Similarly, ASI member Janet Perlman expressed what many felt: ‘You have both meant so much to the indexing community and to MACREX users, and it’s hard to contemplate the loss of both Drusilla and Gale in such a short time span.’

Drusilla loved helping people to use software effectively, as encapsulated by this comment from Do Mi Stauber on the MACREX international list:

> She has given so much to the indexing world over the years, and I have enjoyed her depth of knowledge and sense of humor so much! I remember sitting at the Macrex table at a conference, working on my index with the monitor facing passers-by by way of demonstration. She sat and observed me, and very quickly and excitedly told me, ‘you should be using this keyboard shortcut!!!’ I can’t remember which one it was, but it speeded up my indexing considerably!

Through helping MACREX users for over 30 years, Drusilla came ‘to understand so much about the workings of the indexing brain – I love helping other indexers by working on sorting out their technical problems and have made many good friends that way’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.36#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> This interest in the indexer’s brain led to a collaboration with one of her old school and university friends, Professor Joan Abbott, and a presentation at the 2006 Durham SI conference that is still talked about to this day (see [Abbott and Calvert, 2007](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.36#core-R1)).

With her enthusiasm for new technological developments, Drusilla was also generous with her help and advice more widely, posting detailed replies on SIdeline on a range of problems members were asking about, and contributing articles to the SI newsletter, _SIdelights_, as well as MACREX tips (which she was still providing in 2017, despite the effects of PSP already putting a stop to many of her normal activities).

MACREX was just one part of Drusilla’s indexing life. She also played a huge role in the Society of Indexers and it is difficult to encapsulate her contribution in a few paragraphs. She first joined Council, the SI’s governing body, in 1987. A list of her various SI positions and committee memberships over many years cannot convey her total commitment to the Society and how incredibly hard she worked. She was instrumental in its transformation to bring it into the digital era. When the Internet and email first came into our lives, communication speed changed out of all recognition and Drusilla embraced all of this whole new way of working with enthusiasm. She was very able to see a problem and find a way through it and, more than that, to carry her colleagues with her, though sometimes without them realizing it. She was absolutely pivotal because of her enormous energy and enthusiasm; she really could and did make change happen.

Drusilla cared passionately about the image of the Society and, by extension, about the indexing profession, taking advantage of every opportunity to promote it. At the same time, she was never afraid to express critical views, questioning procedures if she thought they didn’t make sense and often putting into words what more reticent members might have been feeling. She was passionate about the way the Society was run; long-time members remember her sometimes awkward questions at AGMs, or postings to SIdeline arguing against various changes. She would never simply oppose change for the sake of it, but would question its wisdom or the way it was being implemented, though during an email exchange about professional qualifications in March 2009 she began by confessing to being ‘a really grumpy old person!’ before explaining her reservations about the current system.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.36#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup> Two years later she explained why she thought the new membership grading system was misplaced, adding, ‘Well, anyway, that’s my opinion – I’m not expecting you to agree with it’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.36#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup>

It was important to her to make her views known, but criticism was never personal; following one robust email exchange in 2010 she signed off, ‘best wishes (really)’, confessing after the AGM that ratified the controversial proposal, ‘\[I\] was much more worried that you had hard feelings after my outburst’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.36#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup> In the 2012 debate about the future of the Wheatley Medal, Drusilla argued strongly in favour of retaining it in some form, helpfully suggesting various improvements to its scope and the way it was administered, and (inevitably) offering to join any working party that might be set up. This was absolutely typical – constructive criticism and volunteering to help.

Her generosity showed no bounds. When Hilary’s appointment to a chair in oncology at Newcastle led to the family moving to Northumberland, the front room of their London house became the Society’s first ‘office’, and for many years after that it was the venue for occasional meetings. Her generosity was also shown in her willingness to volunteer, despite the fact that she was already doing much more than her fair share. This was typical of Drusilla: ‘If it’s at all useful and if no-one else has come forward, I could help out at the London Book Fair’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.36#fn6" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn6">6</a></sup> The old adage about asking a busy person certainly applied to her, since an email the very next day read, ‘Am at present in the middle of two days on a string quartet course in the north with the Martinu quartet, trying to play Janacek 1 (Kreutzer Sonata, based on horrible short story by Tolstoy) which is dreadfully difficult’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.36#fn7" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn7">7</a></sup>

Music was, of course, a lifelong passion, with Britten and Wagner among her favourite composers. She would urge friends who were rather reluctant to give them a try and also held strong views that she was not afraid to express. In response to an article criticizing the use of surtitles at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, for operas sung in English, she made the following points in a letter to _The Guardian_:

> The last time I saw Billy Budd, a few years ago in Newcastle, again with the charismatic Simon Keenlyside as Billy, I was bowled over by the music but couldn’t follow the words in the choruses and ensembles. This time I was able to refer when necessary to the non-intrusive screen which those in the side of the stalls circle were given to view the surtitles, and this enhanced my enjoyment of the whole opera.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.36#fn8" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn8">8</a></sup>

With music combined with Drusilla’s love of travel, it was sometimes hard to keep up with her; chamber music and cello courses at home and abroad were mentioned in emails (and also skiing trips to France; amongst her many accomplishments, she was a competent and enthusiastic skier). But she would bend over backwards to fit in SI work, despite already having more than enough commitments to juggle:

> Will try to look in more detail at everything else, but I have a workshop tomorrow, the kitchen being dismantled and the piano tuner due any minute (2 hours late!), apart from loads of Macrexing!<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.36#fn9" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn9">9</a></sup>

Drusilla lived life to the full, and it was certainly a very full life. Her emails vividly demonstrate the pace at which she lived life and the chaos into which it sometimes descended, but always described with her characteristic good humour. Invariably travelling with at least one computer, Drusilla would send emails from London, Northumberland, or the Calverts’ house in Spain, and quite often from further afield.

> I’ve been hopping between New York to babysit grand-daughter, Spain with family, all over the place including Finland playing chamber music, and am also now secretary of our local little chamber orchestra in Newcastle – all this apart from having an appalling stressful and enormously chaotic indexing project for which I’ve had to get two helpers … and getting Macrex 8 honed.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.36#fn10" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn10">10</a></sup>
> 
> … for the first time I think in my life I have come to London without my laptop! … 13 May wouldn’t be any good for me – not that it matters! I’ve already booked to go to Venice for a meeting of people I was at school with that morning.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.36#fn11" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn11">11</a></sup>

And it was certainly not unusual to find emails from Drusilla sent in the early hours of the morning.

Most of us last saw Drusilla at the 2015 conference in York, when she was already aware of some of the symptoms of PSP, although it was yet to be diagnosed. By 2017 she knew there was little chance of improvement as it gradually robbed her of the ability to continue with the activities she loved so much, especially playing the cello. But it was absolutely typical of her to admit that she was feeling ‘very upbeat on the whole’, looking forward to a trial she hoped to be enrolled on, and she explained matter-of-factly that ‘it’s the same disease that Dudley Moore had and interestingly most are musicians of some sort – it’s very rare’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.36#fn12" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn12">12</a></sup> Her interest in the Society was undiminished. She had been impressed by the first National Indexing Day and the speed with which it had been put together, remarking that ‘two of my non-indexer friends at least noticed it!’ and she regretted not being able to attend the SI’s diamond anniversary conference, sending us her good wishes and hoping that we all had a great time.

The last word should go to her daughter Polly, who posted on Drusilla’s Facebook page on 26 May:

> I don’t want to remember her as she was at the end, but rather as the fiery, messy, eccentric person that she was for most of her life. A curious mind who loved to travel and learn. A passionate lover of classical music, who got so much joy from playing her cello with friends, listening to music and going to concerts. With Radio 3 as the constant background to our childhoods, Mum seemed to know every piece, every composer and would be moved to tears by the music that she loved most.
