## Abstract

For freelance book indexers, an important part of their continuing professional development (CPD) has been through the conferences and workshops run by their national societies, providing a welcome break from the isolation of working from home, as well as opportunities to hone skills, learn new ones and generally keep abreast with developments in the profession. As COVID-19 spread rapidly round the globe, events began to be cancelled and the indexing community (like many professions) was forced to move online, quickly adapting to the new situation. A survey of freelance indexers who have participated in online CPD, together with the questionnaire responses of those involved in organizing and delivering these events, identifies good practice and shows that they have several advantages over face-to-face events. In some cases they are also filling a previously unmet need. There is no doubt that online events will become a permanent part of the mix of opportunities for professional development in a post-pandemic world. However, although they are effective as a means of conveying content, they simply cannot replicate the interaction and networking that happens when indexers spend time together. This is an equally important aspect of professional development and the resumption of face-to-face events is eagerly anticipated.

We are now a year into the COVID-19 pandemic (at the time of writing) and the prospect of returning to a full programme of face-to-face events in the immediate future is unlikely. The indexing societies have been adapting to this situation and this article aims to show how virtual (i.e. online) events have been contributing to the ongoing professional development of freelance book indexers and to share good practice for the future organization and delivery of such events. The focus is mainly on formal conferences and webinars, but also touches on ad hoc, grass-roots initiatives.

Questionnaires emailed to those involved in delivering online professional development (both organizers and presenters) for the American Society for Indexing (ASI), the Australian and New Zealand Society of Indexing (ANZSI), the Indexing Society of Canada/Societé canadienne d’indexation (ISC/SCI) and the Society of Indexers (SI) yielded a wealth of information on what one might call the supply side. (Several of these events are discussed in more detail below.) In addition, informal conversations and email correspondence with several key players involved in professional development for freelance indexers helped to flesh out further details.

Participants’ experiences were gathered using an online survey, the link to which was shared with members of all the indexing societies via the email list of the International Committee of Representatives of Indexing Societies (ICRIS). In total, 91 usable responses were received, the majority from the UK (30 per cent), the US (24 per cent), Canada (20 per cent), Australia (12 per cent) and Germany (5 per cent). There were also one or two responses each from France, Ireland, The Netherlands, New Zealand and South Africa. Respondents ranged from those still in training to very experienced indexers of more than 20 years’ standing.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> In addition to general questions on the pros and cons of online professional development, respondents could also answer detailed questions on up to three events they had attended. In total there were responses on 122 events, including conferences, webinars, meetings and discussions.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup>

## Into the virtual world

For some years, online platforms (notably Skype, and more recently Zoom) have increasingly been used for indexing society committee meetings and, as the restrictions of COVID-19-related lockdowns kicked in, smaller groups of indexers began to organize informal, ad hoc, socially oriented get-togethers. The American Society for Indexing (ASI), with its extensive programme of webinars, was already ahead of the curve in terms of online professional development, and was the first to organize an online conference. But other societies have also begun to develop their own online professional development programmes. In ANZSI, professional development and networking opportunities had previously been offered by regional groups but were becoming few and far between. The appointment of a new education officer in 2020, with a remit to organize an annual professional development programme, coincided with the onset of COVID-19 and the programme became an online one. To date, two successful online panel discussions have taken place – on biography indexing and on quoting for indexing jobs. As ANZSI president Madeleine Davis noted, ‘It’s curious that we should only be undertaking Zoom meetings now as a result of COVID-19. Especially in Australia, with our vast distances, we should have been doing this years ago!’<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup>

Vast distances are also an issue for ISC/SCI, which is in the process of establishing a webinar programme. This is very much Canadian-focused and, unlike the ASI programme, the webinars are run as meetings in which participants can see one another, to create more of a sense of community. Monthly members’ video chats have also become a regular feature in Canada, covering everything from software, time management and work–life balance to very specific indexing issues (see [Seagren, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#core-r7)). Distance was less of a barrier for indexers in the UK in pre-COVID-19 times but, as elsewhere, the pandemic has forced professional development activity online, with various more informal sessions taking place, as well as a successful annual general meeting (AGM). And SI is expected to run an online conference in conjunction with its 2021 AGM.

It was already apparent by mid-2020 that indexers expected online events to become increasingly important and effective, ‘giving indexers in more isolated locations the chance to participate that they had previously been denied’ ([Kingdom, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#core-r4): 431). In addition, as three-quarters of respondents to the current survey agreed, it is now so much easier to attend events run by other indexing societies. Indeed ASI’s 2020 conference attracted over 80 participants, and not only from North America: as [Li (2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#core-r5): 333) commented, ‘Certainly a major advantage to a virtual setting is the greater capacity for international participation’. At a more local level, indexers unable to have their normal face-to-face meetings have also begun to organize more informal, but nevertheless valuable, online professional development sessions.

## The pros and cons of online professional development

Overall, the advent of online professional development opportunities is being embraced with considerable enthusiasm by the indexing community. In response to questions about their experiences of participating in online events, survey respondents were overwhelmingly positive. The events had been well run, with few technical glitches, and most participants felt they had benefited from attending them, learning new skills and, where this was possible, appreciating the interaction with other indexers. The majority felt that these events had been well worth attending, and they were very likely to attend similar events in future. They had generally enjoyed what was offered and appreciated the work that had gone into organizing them.

### Advantages

Indexing is a niche occupation, its practitioners widely scattered, even within a country the size of Britain. Pre-pandemic, the opportunity to meet other indexers at occasional conferences and workshops was a welcome break from the isolation associated with the freelance life, as well as an opportunity to hone skills, learn new ones and generally keep abreast with developments in the profession. But although 43 per cent of survey respondents had attended conferences regularly (in pre-pandemic times), as many as 20 per cent had never attended one. Most of these non-attenders had never attended a workshop or seminar either, and only a few had been to informal, locally based meetings focused on professional development.

There are many reasons for not attending conferences and meetings, but the tyranny of distance is a major disincentive, particularly after factoring in the time and costs, often involving air travel. It is one of the attractions of freelance indexing that it is not tied to a specific location; indexers can live anywhere and work from home (before this became the norm for many other professions), but the increasing availability of online opportunities for professional development means that members living in remoter areas are now no longer disadvantaged. As Sherrey Quinn pointed out, ‘Online events can reach members wherever they are. ANZSI members are spread across the vast area of Australia and New Zealand (over 5,000 km from the west coast of Australia to NZ)’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup> Similarly in Canada, online communication has proved invaluable in helping to build a sense of community in a large and sparsely populated country, enabling ISC/SCI to deliver more services to its members. Indeed, as one new member stated in the survey, ‘I became an indexer in July 2020 and became part of ISC soon after – I instantly felt part of a thriving, helpful community and this was done entirely through Zoom meetings and webinars’.

Online events have several obvious advantages; most survey respondents agreed that not only are they more affordable, they are also more accessible (distance no longer being a barrier) and easier to attend, having less impact on work or family commitments. Their green credentials are also significant, a key consideration as we face the effects of climate change; as one respondent noted, ‘Online events produce fewer emissions, which makes them better for the planet and the future of the human race’.

Several respondents suggested that online events could easily be held more frequently than in-person ones, and their increasing availability is certainly providing more opportunities for professional development. The majority of respondents had attended at least one such event during the previous three years and several made the point that this was only possible because the event was online. As one commented, ‘I’ve had some great opportunities this past year that I would never have been able to attend live’, while another had ‘“met” more people online than I would have been able to meet in person’. One participant admitted that ‘even though I don’t enjoy being on screen with other people for an hour or two, I learned a tip that made it all worthwhile’. Another enjoyed the fact that ‘online events allow you to really focus on the content, without people coming in and out, outside noise, and other distractions’ that can mar in-person events, while one presenter liked being able to ‘explain things for a long time without being constantly interrupted’. Other comments related to feeling part of the indexing community, connecting and reconnecting with other indexers, picking up tips from more experienced indexers and generally sharing experiences. One respondent noted the benefits of attending a local group networking event where it was possible to ask questions that might have seemed trivial on a forum but could be discussed with context and humour in an online chat.

The level of attendance was similar across all three types of events: 50 per cent had attended a national/regional conference, 58 per cent had attended webinars and 50 per cent had attended informal, locally based meetings or forum discussions focused on professional development. Among regular conference goers, there was a higher level of attendance, with 59 per cent attending online conferences and 67 per cent attending webinars. The fact that over half the respondents who had never attended a face-to-face conference had attended an online conference or webinar (and sometimes both) demonstrates that these are filling a previously unmet need. As Devon Thomas noted, in relation to ASI’s conference, ‘Several people who have been unable to attend in-person conferences expressed the desire to see virtual events like this in the future.’ And with the mushrooming of online events, it is not surprising that more than three-quarters of respondents had also attended events run by other organizations. Although the pandemic has been the main impetus for the dramatic increase in online events, there is no doubt that improvements in connectivity have also contributed to their success.

Online events are also opening up opportunities for people whose disabilities or mental health issues have prevented them from travelling or participating in face-to-face events, and as one survey respondent commented, ‘You can attend even if you don’t feel well.’ Another respondent appreciated the sense of connectivity with fellow indexers from the comfort of her own home, in a favourite chair with refreshments whenever she wanted, though another missed ‘the yummy snacks (that you wouldn’t normally have) at the break’! It is also easier for those with caring responsibilities to attend. One participant (with her camera turned off and her microphone muted) was able to have her young children with her during one of the ANZSI sessions, something that would be impossible (or very much frowned upon) at a face-to-face event.

### Disadvantages

There was less consensus and more uncertainty about the disadvantages of online events; only two-thirds agreed that they feel impersonal and that presenters cannot respond to audience reactions and modify their presentations accordingly. However, several respondents specifically mentioned the lack of interaction between presenters and participants and the loss of spontaneous discussion, and the lack of connection with their audiences was something mentioned by several presenters.

Although technical glitches can sometimes be an issue, it is encouraging that half the respondents did not feel that these distracted them from focusing on presentations. There are also home-grown distractions that cannot be controlled, of course, such as a knock at the door or telephone calls. On the issue of ‘chat’ and networking, half the respondents agreed that this was much more difficult in the online environment, the experience proving rather daunting for those with a fear of speaking, and regular conference-goers missed the opportunities ‘to mingle socially, see old friends and colleagues and make new contacts, as well as to provide the stimulus of a different physical environment’. However, almost 20 per cent did not see this as a problem. This issue is considered in more detail later.

## Planning and organization

In many respects, it is easier to plan an online event than a face-to-face one. There is no need to agree a location, book a suitable venue, grapple with the complexities of delegates’ dietary requirements or ensure wheelchair access. In addition, there is less financial risk. It is also possible to plan over a much shorter timescale. In mid-March 2020, having cancelled a conference in Raleigh, North Carolina, ASI immediately began adapting their plans and converting it into an online event, considering what would work in terms of both topics and presenters. Members were assured that they were ‘working to make the online conference as friendly and interactive as we can, while bringing you important educational offerings to help you enhance your indexing skills, market your business, and discover new business.’<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup> Six weeks later, on 2 May, around 80 indexers logged onto Zoom for ‘Working Smarter to Stay Ahead’. With its established programme of webinars, ASI was in a good position to adapt the planned conference for an online environment and already had a pool of experienced and willing presenters.

### Timing

All-day in-person events are acceptable; they normally include reasonable breaks at lunchtime as well as mid-morning and afternoon, enabling participants to stretch their legs, perhaps get some fresh air, and mingle with one another in a leisurely way, meeting old friends and colleagues and making new contacts. In the online environment, experience suggests that spreading a conference over two or three days is preferable to a single whole-day event. ASI’s first online conference in May 2020 took place over one day, comprising six 50-minute presentations separated by ten-minute breaks, with 30 minutes for ‘lunch’ (the exact meal consumed depending on a participant’s time zone). This proved to be rather intense; the winter conference, ‘Exiting 2020’, was shorter, with four 50-minute presentations separated by ten-minute breaks and 30 minutes for lunch, while the 2021 conference consisted of six presentations spread over two days. Similarly in Canada, the 2021 ‘Indexing Unlimited’ conference consisted of ten presentations spread across three days. In addition to avoiding ‘Zoom-fatigue’ and lapses in concentration, spreading a conference over several days also helps to deal with the challenge of multiple time zones (and not only for events hoping to attract an international audience), allowing the Western-most participants to join at a civilized time.

In terms of session length, there is general agreement that an hour is about right, for both participants and presenters, and scheduling in appropriate breaks is vital. Whether ten minutes is adequate is debatable. ASI had ‘break hosts’ who stayed online during breaks to engage participants in friendly chat. Online events can be more tiring than in-person events, and the participant who commented ‘Looking at things on the computer is sooo not fun anymore!’ was expressing with feeling the sentiment of many who do, after all, basically spend their working lives in front of their screens. Furthermore, as Anne Fifer pointed out, ‘even in face-to-face teaching around an hour is best for optimal attention’. Although ANZSI’s two panel sessions were each scheduled to last for 90 minutes, neither was part of a larger event, and they did actually overrun slightly. Stephen Ullstrom’s webinar for ISC/SCI members lasted around two hours, which he felt in retrospect was slightly too long.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#fn6" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn6">6</a></sup>

### Pricing

An in-person conference can be a financial risk for any small society, requiring careful budgeting in order to break even. By contrast, the upfront costs of an online event are minimal, particularly if much of the organization is done by volunteers, as is the case in most indexing societies, and presenters may also be willing to give their time voluntarily. But costs for an online conference are not negligible. They may include, for example, the time of paid staff, hiring in additional technical help or equipment, and software licences. With in-person events, speakers expect to have their travel expenses reimbursed and most likely expect a fee, but for online conferences it may be sufficient to offer a discount on the conference fee. As Gwen Henson pointed out in relation to ASI’s May 2020 conference, ‘Everyone understood that we were operating during a time of crisis, and I think they were really pleased to pitch in and support the organization.’

Online events should be affordable, but at the same time, participants should expect to pay more than a token fee, and in the case of ASI, for example, the price structure of the existing programme of online educational events was taken into consideration. However, in some cases, as with ANZSI’s panel discussions, no charge was made, but registration was restricted to society members. While indexing societies are getting to grips with organizing online events, experimenting with formats and presentation, it does not seem unreasonable for some to be free to members.

### Programme planning

As with any conference, the aim is to focus on subjects of perennial interest, with sessions covering aspects of running a freelance business as well as indexing know-how, and ideally the programme should also address topical issues and debate. Unless participants are to be separated out into break-out rooms (as has traditionally been the case for SI and ASI in-person conferences), there is the added concern of ensuring that sessions are relevant to both newer and more experienced indexers. Similarly, there are specialized topics that work well at in-person events, where there are several ‘streams’ to choose from, but do not generate enough interest for the whole group. Among survey respondents, the topics eliciting most interest were ‘working efficiently’, ‘developments in publishing’ and ‘software demonstrations’, but there was also considerable support for ‘client relations’, ‘indexing names’ and ‘marketing’.

It is also important to think about what will work well in the online format, whether that be a conference session or a more specialized webinar, though much will also depend on the presenter and their ability to hold the audience’s attention. There is a general feeling that presentations and panel sessions work well, but sessions that depend on active audience participation are not ideal. Kate Mertes turned down the chance to do an online ‘Naked Indexer’ presentation for the ISC/SCI conference,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#fn7" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn7">7</a></sup> fearing that their tendency to ‘degenerate into really fun if somewhat frenetic free-for-alls with people shouting out suggestions’ would not work well online. But by all accounts Fred Leise’s live ‘Naked Indexer’ demonstration at ASI’s ‘Working Smarter to Stay Ahead’ was felt to be a success, prompting much fascinating discussion (see [Li, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#core-r5): 332), though Leise himself admitted that

> it was more difficult to respond to questions in the moment. The nature of the presenter–audience relationship is significantly different – more formal. And of course, the energy level at online presentations is entirely different, since audience members are in separate spaces, as well as being in a different space from the presenters.

Although the online environment is challenging for hands-on sessions that include exercises, such as index peer reviews (though these work well as forum-based events), online software demonstrations can be successful. Trevor Matthews suggested that these are most effectively presented as carefully prepared webinars, making full use of screen-sharing facilities, rather than as ‘live’ conference sessions. He cited Pilar Wyman’s webinar on Index-Manager as a good example.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#fn8" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn8">8</a></sup> In general, most agree that practical, hands-on training sessions are more suited to face-to-face sessions, where the tutor is on hand to troubleshoot, but Cheryl Lenser reports having seen ‘some hands-on training in the online environment that I thought worked really well … the technology might actually work better online in that instance’. It is suggested that the barriers to practical sessions of this kind are not insurmountable, however, and that training can be delivered online for small groups if the content and structure are carefully planned. Furthermore, technology is constantly evolving and adapting to meet needs; Anne Fifer believes that ‘the limitations on type of training that can be done depends on the sophistication of the platform used for the presentation. I’m sure that by the time the pandemic is over and we’re returning to “normal” more and more sophisticated software will be available to us.’

### Speakers

Identifying suitable speakers is much the same for any type of event, depending on who is available and what areas they are comfortable addressing. People who have spoken at previous conferences, indexers known to have particular expertise, or people recommended by speakers who themselves are unable to speak are all potential presenters. Occasional arm-twisting may be required, but generally those who have already given presentations to in-person events have risen to the challenge of the online environment. Some who had never presented online previously jumped at the chance: Madeleine Davis was looking forward to her role as moderator in ANZSI’S first online panel debate and Kate Mertes confessed, ‘I’m a terrible ham, just give me an audience’. For online events, speaker availability and willingness may prove to be less of a problem. Cheryl Lenser pointed out that ‘an online event takes a lot less time commitment due to lack of travel time … \[and\] I don’t have to juggle my project and family commitments as much’, and Ina Gravitz felt that ‘if I had to travel I probably would not have participated: time, money, and travel hassle involved’.

ASI, of course, already has a pool of speakers who have already presented webinars. The less experienced, however, may find the prospect a little intimidating and several speakers admitted to being apprehensive about the online environment; one worried about having to ‘juggle the technology’ during the presentation. JoAnne Burek confessed to a terror of the camera. To overcome her fears, she hired a video coach for one-on-one training and as a result found that ‘video conference presentation is much easier than in front of an audience in a room. I was comfortably in my home, I had the perfect set-up thanks to my coach, and I was able to focus 100% on the presentation. Normally I hate public speaking, but I was feeling good about this.’

However confident and experienced a speaker is, it is important to provide appropriate guidance and to conduct rehearsals, which at a minimum should include a sound check and how to set up PowerPoint presentations for screen sharing. According to Gwen Henson, ‘This rehearsal is a key component for success.’ Stephen Ullstrom learnt the hard way: despite having practised prior to the event, he had some trouble with the screen-sharing options, which was disruptive for participants, and admitted he ‘could have practised and anticipated even more’.

ANZSI has prepared a useful list of tips for both presenters and participants ([Table 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#T1)). And to encourage members to run ad hoc online events, SI has provided them with step-by-step guidance on the technicalities of setting up and running a Zoom meeting. This includes advice on dealing with over-talkative participants and how to encourage the more diffident to contribute.

Other than a trial run with the technology, in terms of preparation most presenters felt it was much the same as preparing for an in-person event. Some prepared PowerPoint presentations and handouts (distributed either before or after the event); others preferred to keep things simple, resisting the organizers’ requests to include visual elements.

### Recording versus privacy

A significant proportion of survey respondents (34 per cent) indicated that they would appreciate having access to recordings of face-to-face events, as they find it difficult to attend such events. Another 10 per cent would prefer to ‘attend’ online versions of face-to-face events. Although as yet face-to-face indexing conferences have not been recorded or live-streamed, this may well be something to consider for the future, perhaps ‘hybrid’ events in which some sessions are recorded for later viewing, or in which some sessions involve remote presenters and/or participants. Technology availability and cost may be a limiting factor. In addition, privacy issues loom large.

For online events, there is an expectation that everything will be made available as a recording; certainly it is something that participants ask about. At the time of writing, ISC/SCI has announced that recordings of their 2021 conference will be made available, but only for those attending and only for a limited time. However, other societies have decided against this at present. Sherrey Quinn provided a useful summary of why ANZSI chose not to record either of their panel discussions.

•

Without recording, frank discussions are possible, with speakers feeling more free to voice opinions.

•

Sometimes commercial in-confidence information may be covered in discussion but it is not appropriate to put it in a permanent record.

•

More sophisticated equipment may be required for a professional-looking recording.

•

Privacy issues would mean that participants may need to be concealed, which is not conducive to the informal discussion sessions envisaged for PD events.

•

The events are a benefit of ANZSI membership, not intended for wider distribution.

Those unable to attend were able to read a summary of the main points from both events in the _ANZSI Newsletter_ ([Gillen, 2020a](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#core-r1); [2020b](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#core-r2); [2020c](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#core-r3)).

Similar views were expressed by Gwen Henson: ‘We strongly wanted to encourage attendee participation, and we felt recording it might cause some individuals to hold back on questions or even comments. Due to the fact that we were all restricted to our homes, interaction was a major goal for this event.’ Survey participants agreed with this policy: ‘Because the event was not being recorded, discussion was more easy, and a lot of valuable points were raised and discussed.’ In addition, recording may require a consideration of legal ramifications and of the variations in privacy regulations from one jurisdiction to another.

Some presenters also feel uncomfortable about events being recorded and may not agree to take part, particularly for sensitive topics such as client relations. One presenter, however, would have liked to have had the session recorded for her personal use. ‘People asked good questions, and it would have been good to collect those questions and my answers for a follow-up session.’ And one survey respondent commented, ‘It can be very difficult, if not impossible, to participate in an all-day event. That is why I feel it is important for the participant to be able to access the online event – or parts of it – at a later date(s).’ That is the beauty of ASI’s programme of webinars: once a webinar has been paid for, it can be watched over and over again, and webinars are not interactive in the same way as a conference session. Users often purchase one when they need to learn or improve a particular skill, for example, rather than attending the ‘live’ event.

## Practicalities

### Platforms

For webinars, ASI has found WebinarJam to be effective, while Zoom currently seems to be the platform of preference for online conferences and more local, informal events (though one respondent questioned its dominance). It includes the option for virtual break-out rooms, so that participants can be divided into smaller groups. Alexandra Peace reported on the very effective use of these for ‘speed networking’ and for a quiz in the 2020 online conference of the UK’s Chartered Institute of Editing and Proofreading (CIEP).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#fn9" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn9">9</a></sup> ISC/SCI was planning to use break-out rooms for small-group discussions on different topics in the 2021 conference.

### Hosts and moderators

Informal events run by local groups, with a limited number of participants, simply need one person to lead the session (who may also be giving a presentation). Generally, however, experience suggests that in addition to the speaker(s) there should also be a ‘host’ or ‘Zoom chair’ who admits participants to the event and takes care of technical issues, and a ‘moderator’ whose main role is to monitor the ‘chat’ feature (and the Zoom ‘raised hands’) and direct questions to the presenter as and when necessary. This enables speakers to focus on giving their presentations. The host and moderator should work as a team, agreeing in advance their individual roles and how they will run the event. As Devon Thomas explained for ASI’s ‘Exiting 2020’ conference,

> We created a script and planned who would introduce each speaker, for example. This was informal in nature but worked really well … Gwen also created a master PowerPoint to use to introduce each speaker. We wanted to create a professional appearance by having title slides for each session.

[Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#F1) shows how ANZSI adopted a similar approach for their first online panel discussion, creating a detailed timetable for the event. By contrast, Stephen Ullstrom felt that he and his co-host had not prepared a sufficiently detailed plan for their workshop, having ‘moments of uncertainty while presenting about who was going to do what’.

### Online etiquette

As indexers become more used to participating in online events, the minor irritations that can mar an online session (mentioned by several survey respondents) should become less frequent: the failure to mute, allowing background household disturbances to intrude; the failure to turn video off while coming and going from one’s computer or dealing with other household members. Cat lovers may enjoy seeing a fellow indexer’s pet stalking across the desk, obscuring the screen with its tail, but not only does this this kind of thing distract other participants, it is also discourteous to the presenter. Although we are all participating from the comfort of our own homes, it behoves us to behave in as professional a manner as possible during online conferences. The ANZSI guidelines shown in [Table 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#T1) should be required reading for anyone participating in an online event. More detailed advice on how to behave during online meetings in provided by Savage ([2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#core-r6)), with the paragraphs focusing in turn on the 11 letters of WEBINARTIPS:

**W**ebcam (position, stability)

**E**tiquette (arriving on time, not eating)

**B**ackground (blurring, virtual backgrounds)

**I**nterrupt (politely, using non-verbal cues)

**N**o hackers

**A**ttire (appropriate)

**R**eliable connection

**T**est (technology and software)

**I**nvolvement (no multitasking)

**P**arting ways (temporarily leaving meeting)

**S**ilence (muting)

To ensure that events run smoothly, Gwen Henson recommends that at the beginning of the day, after welcoming participants, the host or moderator explains some basic housekeeping rules, especially on how to ask questions (Zoom’s hand-raising feature or via ‘chat’) and when to ask them (at the end of the presentation or at intervals during it, depending on the speaker’s preference).

### Technical hitches

By and large, survey respondents felt that most of the events they had attended had run smoothly, with good audio and video quality and effective screen sharing, but we can all sympathize with the sentiment of one participant – ‘The technology is great when it works but a pain when it doesn’t’ – compounded by the absence of on-site technical support. One respondent mentioned losing the host for a while, ‘but we were able to continue without her’, and only one event apparently had to be abandoned: ‘We had to leave the webinar and come back a different day because of audio difficulties. Everything worked fine when we reconvened and the webinar itself was very informative.’ Several respondents mentioned particular problems with their own set-up – mainly time lags and ‘freezing’ due to poor connectivity – but the importance of speakers having a good connection was also emphasized. Some speakers gave the impression of being unfamiliar with the technology, but respondents appreciated that many were new to the online environment and that things would improve. ‘This was a first effort, so presenters had a bit of difficulty with their visuals, but they figured it out.’

There are always going to be technical issues but as far as possible these can be minimized with careful planning. The advice from Gwen Henson of ASI is to plan:

> Plan for tech problems and know how you’re going to handle them. Rehearse with every speaker. Make sure they know what to expect and what you expect from them. When something goes wrong, stay calm.

Participants understand that sometimes things will go wrong in the online environment and are generally sympathetic. It is impossible to anticipate all eventualities (a major power outage, for example), but survey respondents appreciated organizers having thought about what could go wrong and being able to handle the situation: ‘There were a couple of technical glitches but the moderator instantly and professionally fixed the issue.’ It is not uncommon for a presenter to have trouble with screen sharing to show PowerPoint slides. It is essential that the host requests copies of these in advance, so that when a problem arises, they can be shown from the host’s computer. PowerPoint slides may also have problems of legibility, in just the same way as they do at an in-person event, which participants find frustrating. Several presenters mentioned taking care to ensure that this was not a problem, but there were still pleas from some respondents about including less detail on slides, and making handouts available to participants.

Face-to-face events are not without their problems, of course, as several respondents noted. ‘I don’t expect an event to have no technical issues. In-person events have their own technical issues, such as microphones not working so I wouldn’t expect online events to be exempt or be expected to be perfect.’

## Participation and interaction

> You miss the face-to-face interactions and spontaneous discussions that often emerge during a live presentation.

This comment from Diana Witt was echoed by many participants and presenters, several mentioning the difficulty of picking up on the nuances of interaction through body language. As Kate Mertes pointed out, ‘You can’t rely on people’s reactions when speaking online … you have no idea what sort of response you’re getting, when to elaborate, when people are getting bored or confused, when they’re really engaged.’ Similarly, when screen sharing, Cheryl Lenser felt she was talking to herself, which she found disconcerting, and JoAnne Burek ‘would have liked to see the person asking the question on screen’.

After months of isolation, with little or no social contact, both presenters and participants appreciated ‘meeting’ fellow indexers via the Zoom gallery, but this was a poor substitute for the small-group and one-to-one networking that takes place during an in-person conference over a leisurely meal or a drink in the bar at the end of the day. The benefits of such interactions are unquantifiable but are nevertheless a vital part of professional development in the widest sense.

Apart from the fact that it is tiring communicating via a computer screen, the larger the event, the harder it is to interact; 25 has been suggested as a manageable number. And as several respondents pointed out, with a large event the Zoom ‘gallery view’ shows only about 20 people at a time. One participant found it ‘difficult to join in in discussions online because there are no physical cues – a lot of people may talk over each other’. Similarly, there is the problem of the participant who tries to dominate an online discussion. There is no easy solution to these issues; encouraging participants to mute except when asking questions destroys any hope of spontaneity. Dividing a larger group up into several break-out rooms, perhaps on the basis of interests or level of experience, is one option. Ann Hudson felt that interacting on Zoom ‘is fine for people who know each other already, less easy for others’. Several survey respondents felt intimidated in larger groups where they did not know most people, and the person who ‘found it too intimidating to venture an opinion about anything’ was not alone. However, this can also apply to in-person events and some admitted that this was their normal style of participation (i.e. not participating). And presentations overrunning, leaving little time for questions (mentioned by several respondents), is certainly not unique to online events.

### Questions and answers

As noted above, for conference sessions and webinars it is absolutely essential to have a moderator to watch for questions and manage them, ideally grouping them thematically; otherwise the ‘chat box’ becomes a huge distraction and speakers can easily lose their train of thought. Some speakers are comfortable moving between presentation and questions; others prefer having a Q&A session at the end. Ina Gravitz much preferred to break up the lecture by not saving questions until the end, feeling that this helped to keep participants’ attention. Gwen Henson agreed: ‘She conducted it much as you would if you were in the same room and “held” the room’s interest with her friendly style.’ It is normal practice for participants to be globally muted until it is their turn to ask their question; an alternative is for the moderator to ask the questions. Devon Thomas reported that as moderator, she also occasionally had to break in with urgent questions, and would also sometimes encourage presenters to expand on an answer.

As can be seen from [Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#F1), ANZSI’s online panel discussions were conducted in a different way, and this is another model that could be adopted for some events. For the biography event, a panel of three specialist indexers discussed some of the issues and challenges relating to indexing biographies and answered questions that had been sent in prior to the event. These had been collated and grouped into three blocks (headings and locators, subheadings, and compilation and production issues), and the panellists and the chair of the session were able to formulate answers before the event. Due to time pressures, most of the focus was on these questions and there was little time to deal with questions submitted during the event.

## Grass-roots initiatives

This article has mainly focused on formal online events organized by national indexing societies and advertised to the national membership (and often to indexers worldwide too). However, there have also been a variety of more informal events, run by local groups or individual indexers. Survey responses indicated that participants appreciated ‘meeting’ other indexers at such events, but also benefited from attending them in terms of professional development. Several are briefly outlined here with the aim of encouraging readers of _The Indexer_ to organize similar events themselves or with their own local groups.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#fn10" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn10">10</a></sup>

One survey respondent from the US reported on a local chapter event about workplace ergonomics:

> Everyone could submit photos of their workspace in advance. During the event, each person in turn who submitted photos could describe the features of their workspace, explain what worked and didn’t work well for them, and everyone could ask questions or provide feedback or suggestions. It was moderated so that each person had enough time to speak, and it went very well.

In Canada there have also been ad hoc, grass-roots initiatives, including online study groups for professional indexing software (Cindex and Sky Index). The suggestion for the ISC/SCI workshop on indexing Indigenous oral history, run by Stephen Ullstrom, came from Stephen himself. He describes it as ‘a bit of an experiment’, which he had volunteered to run, prior to the Society approving a formal webinar policy. He was ‘curious to see if I enjoyed presenting the workshop, and if I want to do more in the future’. As a small, volunteer-run organization, the Society has a limited capacity to host events, and is partly reliant on members being willing to step forward and volunteer to present. The workshop focused on a 700-page book he had recently indexed and was run as a lecture with breaks for Q&A in between sections. Participants were sent two chapters from the book, as well as the index, prior to the event, to gain familiarity with the content and think about how they would approach the index. Indigenous oral history is an area that is receiving greater attention from Canadian publishers and throws up interesting indexing challenges. The workshop was favourably received by participants, but running it also threw up some challenges (particularly with screen sharing) and was a useful learning experience.

In the UK, several local groups have run successful online professional development sessions, and the SI training director, Ann Hudson, has run three focusing on indexing historical material. Participants ranged from students to the very experienced; the students were fascinated to hear of the everyday experiences of working indexers, and ‘the experienced indexers enjoyed chewing over various indexing conundrums’. Numbers were limited to around 12, to facilitate participation, and the sessions were very loosely structured, depending on participants’ particular interests, but as an experienced workshop leader, Ann had topics and questions ready in case discussion flagged.

Successful professional development can also take place through online forums. The SI Yorkshire group experimented with running a peer review exercise in this way over several weeks during May 2020. Originally intended as a local in-person event, it proved surprisingly effective, allowing a more in-depth consideration of particular issues thrown up by the publication being indexed, and benefited from contributions from several members in other parts of the country. Group leader Melanie Gee posted new discussion points every few days, and ‘people could dip in when they had time – there was no pressure to contribute straight away, or to all the discussion points’. The discussion has remained on the forum, together with a tongue-in-cheek index to it, using forum pages as locators. A similar exercise is being planned at the time of writing.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.19#fn11" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn11">11</a></sup>

## A virtual future?

Can online events replace the face-to-face conferences and workshops that have traditionally provided the ongoing professional development that freelance indexers need? The answer must be a resounding ‘No’. We have rapidly become much more comfortable with interacting with the rest of the world though a screen and there is no doubt that online professional development has proved its worth and is here to stay. And as one survey respondent commented, ‘I see this as an opportunity for all the international indexing societies to work more closely together and offer each other more member opportunities for continuing professional development’. There is general agreement that in a post-pandemic world online events should be part of a broad mix of opportunities. And their importance for indexers who are unable to attend in-person events, for whatever reason, should not be underestimated. Indeed, for 15 per cent of survey respondents, having professional development mainly delivered online was the preferred option. However, the vast majority (77 per cent) would prefer a mixture of in-person and online events, with only 7 per cent opting for mainly face-to-face events.

Webinars have already become established as a valuable tool for presenting content, where little or no discussion or interaction is required, and one possible scenario might be a series of smaller, more focused online events, interspersed with less frequent face-to-face events. This will need careful planning, to avoid the danger of online events becoming so dominant that there are insufficient topics (and speakers) for in-person events to remain viable. Yet another scenario is the hybrid conference, with sessions live-streamed or recorded for later viewing, an option that appealed to a third of survey respondents. But it may be some time before indexers will feel confident about attending face-to-face meetings, especially in countries that have seen a higher incidence of COVID-19. At the time of writing, the hybrid conference model is under consideration for the 2022 international conference in Berlin, ‘Continental Connections’.

Indexers are still feeling their way in the online world. As we have seen, some argue that hands-on training may be more effective in the online environment, while others feel that this is one area where face-to-face is definitely superior, particularly if participants need to be split up into smaller groups, or even need one-to-one attention. Some argue that the face-to-face environment is more conducive to panel discussions, avoiding the time lags with online voice technology, yet ANZSI’s experience has shown that if these are well planned they can work really well.

The bottom line may well be one of the deciding factors: online events are more economical to run, and this is always going to be significant – freelance indexers do not have generous employers to fund conference attendance. But online and in-person events are equally important. As we have seen, both have their strengths and weaknesses and, as organizers, presenters and participants all agree, although online events are effective as a means of conveying content, they simply cannot replicate the networking that happens when indexers spend time together. This networking is an important component of professional development, not only for building the indexing community, but also more practically, for making those contacts that lead to work opportunities, for example, and allowing spontaneous conversations about anything and everything indexing-related. And despite her enthusiasm for online events, Ina Gravitz echoes the sentiments of many in hoping that ‘we will be able to return to in-person events, which are really important for newer indexers in getting themselves known and just plain fun for us oldies who get to see each other’.
