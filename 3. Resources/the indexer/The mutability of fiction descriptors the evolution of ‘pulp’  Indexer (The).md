## Abstract

The term ‘pulp’ is rarely used in library cataloguing as a descriptor for fiction and does not appear in indexing vocabularies such as the Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms (LCGFT). In contrast, it is used extensively as a tag for large numbers of fiction titles in social cataloguing sites such as LibraryThing and Goodreads. We explore the reasons for the library world’s reluctance to adopt the term, with reference to the history of the term and the fiction it represents. We then report on a comparative thematic analysis of LibraryThing user reviews of ‘old’ and ‘new’ pulp, uncovering an evolution in the way the term has been used. Its more positive usage in contemporary descriptions suggests that pulp’s exclusion from LCGFT should be reviewed.

## Introduction

A criticism sometimes levelled against fiction indexing, as applied in the library context at least, is its lack of inclusivity, with certain forms and genres not even represented in controlled indexing vocabularies such as the Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms (LCGFT) (Library of Congress, n.d.). In the English-speaking world, most libraries use LCGFT to index particular forms and genres of material, which means that these omissions greatly reduce access to these kinds of materials via library catalogues and other bibliographic databases, as they are otherwise only searchable when their terms happen to appear elsewhere in the cataloguing data, such as in the series title or in a note. The omissions cannot be explained away in terms of libraries’ focus exclusively on ‘literary’ works, as public libraries have been offering their readers a range of popular fiction for many years and adopting an increasingly inclusive approach to collection development. As a result, virtually any form or genre of fiction can be found in one library or another. Indeed, some fiction genres are present on library shelves in large numbers, and _are_ represented in the LCGFT list, including, for example, _Action and adventure fiction, Detective and mystery fiction, Fantasy fiction, Romance fiction, Science fiction_ and _Thrillers._ Yet other terms, for certain other categories of fiction, remain excluded from this list, and thus not searchable, despite their ongoing publication and, in some cases, popularity. In a recent study comparing the presence of tags for LCGFT and non-LCGFT genres in the social cataloguing platform LibraryThing (LT), [Hider (2020)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R21) found the sample of non-LCGFT tags to be markedly more common, in fact, than the sample of tags covered by LCGFT, with the non-LCGFT ‘chick lit’ the most used tag of all. ‘Pulp’, also absent from LCGFT, came in third, and was over 16 times more frequently used, as a tag, than that of the mid-ranking LCGFT genre, _Picaresque fiction._ All of the non-LCGFT tags, including ‘pulp’, were used for titles that were also in library collections, as well as the LT users’ collections.

One of the key criteria for inclusion in LCGFT (Library of Congress, 2021: 2), and indeed for library indexing vocabularies generally ([Hider, 2018](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R20): 185), is that of _use_. Yet if _Picaresque fiction_ is thus included in LCGFT, why is ‘pulp’, for instance, not included? The latter term is clearly used a lot more. So why this reluctance in the library world to use the term as a searchable descriptor? This article explores this question, shedding light on the circumstances of this particular omission, with reference to past and present usage of the term ‘pulp’, culminating in a comparative thematic analysis of LT user reviews of ‘old’ and ‘new’ pulp. As with various other forms and genres, the way pulp has been viewed, and the way the term has been used, has changed over time, with the evidence suggesting that ‘pulp’ is now used in a way that merits a review of its exclusion from LCGFT. As such, its case illustrates the impact that the mutability of fiction descriptors can have on the effectiveness of indexing practice.

Whether pulp should be viewed as a genre or a form of fiction depends on how ‘genre’ and ‘form’ are defined; for the purposes of this article, we shall follow LCGFT by defining both genre and form as ‘categories of resources that share known conventions’ and making no attempt to distinguish between genres and forms (Library of Congress, 2021: 3). This broad definition allows us to conceive of genres (and forms) as representing a wide range of categories, a notion that points to the etymological origins of ‘genre’ (i.e. the Latin _genus_).

## The origins of pulp fiction and its term

For those familiar with the way the term ‘pulp’ tended to be used in relation to fiction in the twentieth century, the reason why it has never figured as a label favoured by librarians may seem obvious. While its literal meaning is based on the material the fiction was printed on, this introduced some distinctly negative connotations more or less from the outset: it was printed on a low-quality paper (wood pulp) to cut costs, and on the assumption that it did not need to be long-lasting and would be thrown away after reading; likewise, its content was generally considered low-quality and of no lasting value, targeting an ill-educated and ‘lowbrow’ market. The fact that pulp sold in significant numbers was not a good argument a hundred years ago for libraries to collect or promote it; at that time, librarians saw their mission as focused on education, not leisure, and as providing materials that would support this education, an education that might cover ‘literature’, in a canonical sense, but not in a wider, inclusive sense. Indeed, the aim was to wean readers _off_ such ‘trashy’ and ‘unhealthy’ material as pulp fiction, and onto more ‘wholesome’ material that would help and encourage them to move up in the world ([Ross, 2009](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R35)).

Earlier models of reading, or ‘good’ reading, therefore emphasised its developmental use: schools and libraries were established to foster literacy, impart information, and enable the learning of practical skills and knowledge, as well as to instil desirable values and moralities. [Ross (2009)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R35) identifies two models that influenced the approach of public libraries in the first half of the twentieth century: ‘reading with a purpose’ in which the reader borrows books in order to _learn_ from them, and the ‘only-thebest’ model that tasked children’s librarians with guiding young readers towards ‘quality’ literature and away from the ‘path of least resistance’ that children would otherwise take: that is, towards the ‘dime novels in the nineteenth century and the series books in the twentieth century’ ([Ross, 2009](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R35): 640).

Yet these views of reading and reading provision lost ground as the twentieth century progressed – a shift expanded upon in the next section. A material’s popularity _is_ now an argument for libraries to acquire it. Accordingly, various popular genres are present and promoted in the modern library, even though some of these, such as romance and fantasy, have likewise been treated with some disdain by certain segments of society. Indeed, ‘genre fiction’ as a whole, contrasted unfavourably by many of the earlier educators and librarians with ‘literary fiction’, is now a staple of the public-library collection – but not ‘pulp’, or at least not according to the library catalogue.

The original pulps were magazines that ended up superseding the ‘dime novels’ of the nineteenth century. Printed on paper made directly from wood pulp, they first included instalments of several concurrent stories, but soon comprised whole stories in a single issue, to be devoured at one sitting ([McCann, 1995](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R28)). The emphasis was on a cheap, easy, fast-paced, enjoyable read ([Johnson-Woods, 2004](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R22)). Starting up at the turn of the twentieth century, the pulps’ popularity peaked between the world wars, with a proliferation of publishing houses focused on producing stories as quickly and cheaply as possible, driven almost entirely by market demand (Ashley, n.d.). As the market evolved, so did the genres, or subgenres, of pulp. Lurid covers served as a key selling device, while advertising revenue was limited, in contrast to that of the ‘slick’ magazines, printed on higher-quality paper and aimed at the burgeoning middle classes; the pulps targeted the working classes, and predominantly working-class men ([McCann, 1995](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R28); [Smith, 2000](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R38)).

The pressure on costs meant that authors of the pulps were poorly remunerated compared to writers for the slicks. They were expected to churn out formulaic stories on demand, with very short timelines, and were paid piecemeal. Their status as writers was, in fact, as marginal as their genre ([McCann, 1995](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R28)). On the other hand, the most prolific of them could earn a decent living, for the times, and could, with luck and perseverance, graduate to more respectable forms of writing in due course, with the novelist Raymond Chandler being perhaps the most famous case in point. Those in the pulp industry were not necessarily embarrassed by their status or their work; indeed, those pulp authors who wrote for a living did so as professionals, some even seeing their work as a more honest form of writing than that of the slicks ([McCann, 1995](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R28); [Hersey, 1974](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R19); [Turner, 1948](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R40)). This outlook correlated with the outlook, according to McCann, of the archetypal ‘hard-boiled’ detective, the hero of many a pulp story, who was moral, but also pragmatic and gritty, sometimes needing to resort to violence and cunning to get the job done. These detectives were also somewhat macho, reflecting the period in which the pulps were published, and the disposition of their primary audience.

The pulps in their literal sense died out shortly after the Second World War, due to a number of factors, including the arrival of the paperback, which was generally not printed on pulp paper (Ashley, n.d.). However, the paperback did not simply replace the pulps in terms of content; while the content of some paperbacks was pulp-like, the range of paperback content was much broader, covering non-fiction as well as fiction, and even, ultimately, literary fiction ([Rabinowitz, 2014](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R34); [Mandler, 2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R30)). The form and style of pulps – the genre – thus retained, to some extent, the ‘pulp’ label, even after the demise of the technology.

Like many genres, pulp as a category of content, as opposed to carrier, is complex. According to [Server (2002](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R37): xi), the category encompasses pulp

> as a genus of imaginative reading matter distinguished by mass production, affordability, an intended audience of common as opposed to elite readers, a dependence on formula and genre; and pulp as a literature aimed at the pleasure centres of the reader, primarily concerned with sensation and escape, variously intended to excite, astonish or arouse.

In a way, pulp was a super-genre, associated with quick thrills and sensuous reading experiences. Various more specific genres were developed within pulp as vehicles for these experiences, including the archetypal hard-boiled detective genre (or sub-genre, in contrast to the more mainstream detective stories that typically had quite different, upper-middle-class settings), westerns, romance, science fiction and fantasy, and many more specific hybrid and sub-genres, such as the ‘weird-menace’ pulps (Ashley, n.d.). [Frenkel (2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R14): 183) has argued that chick lit forms part of ‘a type of umbrella genre’ that she labels ‘pleasure’, ‘constituted as an ephemeral archive that is translated into popular fiction when it is read as a history of feeling in public cultures’. Pulp is similarly associated with pleasure, and perhaps also forms part of such an umbrella genre. Like genres generally, however, pulp is not, and, as a genre, never has been, a strict, taxonomic classification: not all science fiction, for instance, would be considered pulp, and what counts as pulp and what does not change over time.

As a genre, or super-genre, under continuous development, pulp did not always stick to tried and tested themes; new forms of pulp could be nurtured by new audiences, sometimes in progressive or countercultural ways, contributing even to the social awakening and advancement of that audience ([Rabinowitz, 2014](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R34)). A case in point is ‘gay pulp’, which emerged in the interwar period ([Burgess, 2017](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R9)) and helped form gay identity, at least through its post-war iterations ([Gunn and Harker, 2013](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R15); [Rabinowitz, 2014](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R34)). With so many different audiences having engaged in pulp, it offers considerable potential as a social-historical source, as Johnson-Woods has demonstrated in her survey of Australian post-war pulp, including, for example, its ‘atomic’ sci-fi novels, reflecting, as they did, the contemporaneous concern about the emerging Cold War ([Johnson-Woods, 2006](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R23)).

## The pulps after pulp

In the middle of the twentieth century, when pulps in their literal sense gave way to the paperback, their content was still generally considered of little merit, was mostly ignored by literary critics, and was not covered in surveys of literature (e.g. [Smith, 1957](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R39)). Likewise, in whatever form, pulps were rarely acquired by libraries ([Flota et al., 2016](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R13)), and were even more rarely signposted by them. Fiction was not usually assigned subject or genre headings in the library catalogues of this period anyway, and was shelved by author. However, books _about_ particular genres, like science fiction, were accommodated in the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) list by this time (Library of Congress, 1957), and had their own class numbers in the Dewey decimal classification (DDC) by the late 1970s ([Dewey, 1979](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R11)). ‘Pulp fiction’, on the other hand, was nowhere to be seen, and _still_ is not an LCSH, though ‘Pulp literature’ became a heading in the year 2000. It is also still not featured in DDC.

The continued marginalisation of pulp fiction in the library world, or at least of its label, has been thrown into sharper relief in the past two decades by two fundamental areas of development: first, libraries’ increasing interest in acquiring genre fiction and also in improving bibliographic access to their fiction collections generally; and second, the advent of the internet and its transformation of the publishing industry, and the supply of and demand for fiction.

The modern approach to library collection policy aligns with the way in which libraries, or public libraries at least, see their role in contemporary society. First and foremost, they provide access to information, and that means whatever information, or content, their users are looking for, as summed up in the title of a well-known collection development guide, _Give ’em what they want!_ (Baltimore County Public Library, 1992). Libraries have thus adopted a much more neutral stance to collecting, at least officially: librarians aim not to judge, but rather to facilitate and connect, including connecting users to the materials they would like to read. This shift from librarians’ previous more paternalistic approach to collection building started long ago, but reached a new level in the face of the internet, a pivotal development, of course, for information access more generally ([Alfino and Pierce, 2001](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R1)). Further, public libraries have established themselves not only as places of informal learning and education, but also as places that support leisure, including leisure reading ([Hayes and Morris, 2005](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R18)). Readers’ purposes, therefore, are also not judged: whether for pleasure, for information, for learning or for a combination of these and other reasons, all are equally valid in the contemporary public-library environment. Similarly, popular fiction is no longer dismissed as a subject of study for the academy, but is one that can provide valuable insights into the preoccupations and culture of its audience ([Rabinowitz, 2014](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R34); [McIntyre and Nette, 2017](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R29); [Nette and McIntyre, 2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R33)). Accordingly, academic and research libraries have made greater efforts to add these materials to their collections as well, for the purpose of scholarship. In sum, many of the genres represented in pulp fiction are now collected by both public and academic libraries, some in large numbers.

In parallel with these developments has been a push toward providing greater access to fiction via the library catalogue. The American Library Association (1991) first published its _Guidelines on subject access to individual works of fiction, drama, etc._ (GSFAD) in the early 1990s, including a list of terms that could be used to supplement those available in LCSH. By the time of the second edition (American Library Association, 2000), many catalogue records for fiction included subject and genre terms. Then, in the mid-2000s, the Library of Congress started separating out its genre and form descriptors from its subject headings, and developing a new list of headings, the aforementioned LCGFT, to be used in tandem with LCSH, not just for belles-lettres, but also for various other kinds of material, such as music and film. The LCGFT was based on the genre and form terms extant in LCSH, but also incorporated other terms from such sources as GSFAD. The genre terms in LCGFT have been used to index fiction for over five years now (Library of Congress, 2021: 2); the list is continuously updated. We have already noted that relatively obscure genres such as _Picaresque fiction_ can be found in LCGFT, and thus included in library cataloguing, whereas ‘pulp’ and ‘chick lit’ cannot, along with various other tags used in LT, such as ‘hardboiled’ and ‘gaslamp’. Other genres that _are_ represented in LCGFT include _Nonsense fiction, Samurai fiction_ and _Hunting fiction_; like _Picaresque fiction_, these genres have very little representation on LT, however ([Hider, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R21)). Some of the more commonplace categorisations of fiction would be omitted because they are considered to ‘require a value judgment on the part of catalogers and users’ (Library of Congress, 2021: 1). ‘Classics’, for example, would be excluded on this basis, and it is very possible that pulp has also been excluded for this reason, given the generally negative way in which it has, historically, been viewed.

Meanwhile, the wider book environment has been impacted by the internet in a quite profound way. The advent of the downloadable ebook has, potentially, made publishing dramatically cheaper, just as pulp paper did, but also given rise to a fiercely competitive market, just as pulp paper did, with increasingly narrow profit margins ([Benhamou, 2015](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R6)). Moreover, readers’ options now extend far beyond the formal publishing industry, with authors able to bypass it altogether and release their material independently and, if they choose to, for free ([Brantley, 2012](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R8)). At the turn of the twentieth century, a greatly expanded population of readers afforded a corresponding expansion of content and genres; a hundred or so years later, a greatly expanded population of authors made for another explosion of content, and an even greater diversity of kinds of writing, including those that might be labelled pulp, or ‘new pulp’ ([Miller, 2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R31)).

## Pulp as tagged on LibraryThing

A cursory scan of the fiction tagged as ‘pulp’ on the LibraryThing (LT) platform suggests that it does not all date back to the days of literal pulp,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> even though the material represented in LT includes plenty published before the internet and before LT, with users commonly cataloguing their personal collections irrespective of the age of the items. It appears, then, that some new material, published in recent times, is still being referred to as pulp, despite not being printed on pulp paper, nor indeed, in some cases, on paper at all. This would also seem to be the case on the Goodreads social cataloguing platform,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> which has overtaken LT as the largest in the world ([Bivins, 2021](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R7)). Pulp as a genre, or category of fiction, would thus appear to be alive and well.

Nevertheless, a more systematic investigation of the ‘pulp’ tags on LT was undertaken to confirm this phenomenon. Prioritising the ‘pulp fiction’ and ‘pulp’ tags, a sample of fiction titles tagged with these terms was generated by taking every fifth entry from lists sorted alphabetically by title, and then searching for it (if it was fiction) in the library database WorldCat.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup> Key details from matching WorldCat records were added to the list of sampled titles, including their publication years and library subject headings (mostly LCSH). A total of 50 titles was compiled. Of these, as many as 36 were published, for the first time, in the twenty-first century; of the other 14, originally published in the twentieth century, three were for items reprinted since then. Bearing in mind that [Hider (2020)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R21) had found a total of over 27,000 works of fiction (or collections of fiction) tagged ‘pulp’ in LT, the sample suggests that there is much new pulp being published, as well as significant interest still in older pulp, according to the LT taggers’ views on what constitutes pulp. Almost all of the newer pulp had been assigned subject headings in the WorldCat records, though not LCGFT (almost all the titles pre-dated the fiction LCGFT). Murder mysteries and detective stories, and science fiction and interplanetary adventures, were well represented, according to these headings. It is also worth noting that the LCSH _Pulp literature_ (as well as variants, such as _Pulp literature, American_) was also assigned to several of the titles, even though strictly the heading would only be applicable if the books were _about_, or partly about, pulp (perhaps in some cases they included introductions about the stories).

The findings from this brief investigation broadly align with contemporary commentary on pulp, which recognises the continuing applicability of the term to new fiction that may be in the style and form of twentieth-century pulp, and include similar themes, but does not need to be printed on pulp paper (Ashley, n.d.; [Miller, 2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R31)). Sometimes the new pulp is distinguished from the old pulp by the prefix ‘neo’, with ‘neo pulp’ a tag to be found, occasionally, in both LT and Goodreads. However, mostly this distinction is not made. Instead, particular vintages of pulp may be associated with particular styles or themes, or cultural contexts, while pulp itself is treated atemporally, as, for example, in the case of the dedicated website ‘Pulp curry’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup> Similarly, the concept-based definition of pulp quoted earlier comes from the _Encyclopedia of pulp fiction writers_, compiled by [Server (2002)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R37), which does not present itself as inextensible. [Khair (2008](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R24): 60–1), providing an overview of Indian pulp fiction in English, offers another definition akin to Server’s:

> In quantitative terms, it denotes cheaply published fiction aimed at the mass market. In this sense its roots go back to the decline of the circulating library in late nineteenth-century Europe, when the popularity of circulating and serialized novels (like those of Dickens) gradually metamorphosed into shorter single volumes – particularly of such genre fiction as the detective novel and science fiction – meant to be sold to individual buyers. In qualitative terms, ‘pulp fiction’ often stands for either ‘bad literature’ or literature with a simple narrative, written in an easily accessible style … pulp fiction is fiction that uses largely fixed generic features to satisfy the largely fixed reading expectations of as large a market as possible.

Meanwhile, [Mongia (2014](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R32): 141), another commentator on Indian pulp, identifies new pulp genres, including ‘chick lit’ and ‘techie’ novels, noting,

> Pulp is written not only to be mass-marketed but also to be consumed in transitional places such as airport lounges and railway stations. As such pulp fiction is fiction which thrives on the promise of journey and transience, on the aspirational promise of a journey bookended by the limitations of belonging.

Nevertheless, some modern-day resources do adopt a more literal definition of the category, including ‘The Pulp Magazine Archive’ and ‘The Pulp Magazines Project’, focusing on the preservation of what is left of the pulps of yesteryear.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup> Even here, though, there is recognition that ‘pulp’ also has a wider meaning (Collier, n.d.).

## Old and new pulp: a comparative study

Social cataloguing platforms like LT and Goodreads are providing new opportunities to study how the general public view and label materials collected both privately and in libraries. Given the prolific use of the tag ‘Pulp’ in LT, for materials both old and new, the authors followed up on their initial investigation of these tags with a thematic analysis of how the term was employed in LT user reviews of samples of old and new fiction tagged as pulp. This analysis aimed to identify any differences in this usage, which would point to changes in content. Content analyses of the social web, including analyses of reader reviews on social cataloguing platforms, have become quite a common means of exploring the views and perspectives of sections of the public, with large amounts of data, in many instances, now readily available ([Driscoll and Rehberg Sedo, 2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R12); [Hajibayova, 2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R16); [Hajibayova and McCorkhill, 2021](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R17)). In this case, a broad cross-section of pulp fiction readers (i.e. those most likely to search for the genre) is sought. An advantage of this research method is its unobtrusiveness: contributors’ comments are not influenced by the researcher. The data are also relatively easy to collect. Limitations of the method include its reliance on the researcher’s interpretation of the text, with no clarifications from contributors feasible (usually), and the possibility of comments being influenced by the public nature of the site.

Two samples of user reviews were generated, one set comprising the reviews including the term ‘pulp’ for 54 fiction titles tagged with ‘pulp’ and originally published in the twentieth century, the other set comprising the reviews including the term ‘pulp’ for 54 fiction titles tagged with ‘pulp’ and originally published in the twenty-first century. (The number 54 was arrived at for the two samples after they had been whittled down due to exclusions, with the aim of ending up with two sets of titles of at least 50 and equal in number.) The first set was compiled by working down the list of tagged titles in LT, sorted by descending number of times tagged, to prioritise those most likely to be archetypes of the old pulp, and excluding those not originally published in the twentieth century, or that were not fiction. There are also titles covered in LT _about_ pulp fiction or other kinds of pulp, and a few books featuring ‘pulp poetry’ and so on. Those with no reviews mentioning ‘pulp’ (in a way that clearly implies that the reviewer identifies the title as pulp) were also excluded. Those reviews from the resulting 54 titles that did mention ‘pulp’ (in a way that clearly implies that the reviewer identifies the title as pulp) were copied and pasted into an Excel spreadsheet, along with their titles’ bibliographic details.

The second sample of reviews was compiled by first working down the list of tagged titles in LT, sorted by descending ‘recency’, in order to more readily find those originally published in the twenty-first century, as many of those most tagged (in the list used for the other sample) were ‘classics’ from the previous century. In this case, those originally published in the twentieth century, as well as those that were not fiction and those with no reviews mentioning ‘pulp’, were excluded. Again, those reviews from the resulting 54 titles that did mention ‘pulp’ (in a way that clearly implies that the reviewer identifies the title as pulp) were copied and pasted into an Excel spreadsheet, along with their titles’ bibliographic details. Most titles in both samples were also linked to publisher’s blurbs, and these were also copied into the spreadsheets.

A total of 155 user reviews of ‘old’ pulp and 114 user reviews of ‘new’ pulp were collected (some titles yielded more applicable reviews than others). Some reviews included multiple mentions of ‘pulp’. The two authors independently attempted to identify those words or phrases in the reviews that referred to each mention of ‘pulp’. Instances of such words or phrases included adjectives qualifying the term, or words and phrases later in the same sentence or paragraph used as a substitute, conceptually, for the term. Specific examples include the term ‘action-packed’ in the phrase ‘action-packed pulp’, and the italicised terms in the following passage: ‘This is a classic pulp _science-fiction/fantasy_ novel, with all that that title entails. So, there’s _colonialism_ (albeit turned kind of on its head), _sexism_ (with an appropriately _beautiful damsel in distress_), and a _hero who can practically accomplish anything_.’

The two authors’ mark-ups were compared and found to coincide quite closely. Only those that did coincide were used in the subsequent thematic analysis, which involved the first author coding for each concept represented by the words and phrases. The resulting codes were grouped under various facets, and verified by the second author. The coding for the two sets of reviews was kept separate, for purposes of comparison.

### _Findings_

Corresponding to the greater number of reviews and mentions of the ‘old’ pulp were more counts for concepts identified as describing ‘old’ pulp. This was factored into the comparison of the coding across the two samples. Most of the publishers’ blurbs did not include the term ‘pulp’, nor the coded terms in the reviews, which strongly suggests the independence of the reviewers’ labelling and views.

Similar spreads of genres connected to ‘pulp’ were identified by the reviewers of both samples: adventure and action featured most prominently, but also prominent were science fiction, detective/hard-boiled, noir and crime. Fantasy, mystery, lesbian, horror and other genres and subgenres, even ‘planetary romance’, were also represented. While the preponderance confirmed pulp’s traditionally male orientation, lesbian and planetary romance, for example, indicate some room for varied flavours of pulp, both today and in yesteryear, oriented to other market segments. Archetypes such as ‘hardboiled detective novels, noir, and great crime novels (old and new)’ – the coverage listed by the Goodreads ‘Pulp Fiction’ group – are well represented, but are clearly archetypes only and by no means the limit of pulp’s reach. Likewise, the category, according to LT taggers, extends beyond the scope of LibraryThing’s own ‘Pulp Tales!’ group, which covers ‘Sword & Sorcery, Sword & Planet, Planetary Romance, Weird Fiction, Lost Worlds, Hollow Earth, Rocket Men and the like’.

Both samples confirmed many of the received ingredients of pulp, with a strong presence of heroes and villains, and a good measure of derring-do and grittiness. Storylines are fast-paced and often exciting, though lacking in characterisation and realism. Pulp tends to be ‘shallow’ and ‘simplistic’, often formulaic. The stories are to be read for ‘fun’ and ‘entertainment’, and not meant to be taken seriously. Settings in time and place are also similar: while twentieth-century pulp was often set contemporaneously (though not in the case of science fiction), a popular setting for twenty-first-century pulp remains Prohibition America of the 1930s, the ‘golden era’ for literal pulp. Settings tend to be ‘seedy’, and quite often ‘dark’.

However, the samples indicated some significant differences in the way the ‘pulp’ label is applied to twentieth- and twenty-first-century writing. Strikingly, the older pulp was frequently considered ‘offensive’, with stereotypical characters representing the sexist and colonialist attitudes of its time. Readers could expect ‘macho’ male leads and female bit players, typically ‘damsels in distress’ or femmes fatales. Stereotypical characters also feature in the new pulp, but with less of the political incorrectness. Conversely, sex and violence were more likely to be associated with the new pulp than with the old stories, again very likely due to the changed social mores. While pacing has remained fast, the ‘non-stop’ and ‘rip-roaring’ narrative was seemingly more a feature of the old pulp, possibly due to greater adherence to tried and tested formulas: not only did the storyline hurry along, so too did the writers.

The most notable difference between the identification of old and new pulp, though, is in the way the former is conceived in more derogatory terms, just as it tended to be in the twentieth century. ‘Pure pulp’ of yesteryear is ‘schlocky’ and ‘trashy’, ‘sleazy’ and ‘throwaway’, as well as being politically incorrect. New pulp can still be ‘artless’, as well as superficial and ‘thin’; it is still not read for its message. Indeed, its entertainment value is emphasised even more, and it remains a ‘quick read’. However, the cheap and disposable nature of pulp, as indicated by the original meaning of its name, is not so much a feature of new pulp. Old and new pulp share the same label because they have enough characteristics and ingredients in common, but this does not mean that they are same: pulp has evolved with the times. Old pulp, as seen through the lenses of modern readers, might still be enjoyable, but only if its offensiveness and datedness can be put aside. Routinely, reviewers warn about the need to recognise that old pulp is a product of its times. It can be read by emphasising its disposability: its contents do not need to be taken seriously because ultimately it is to be consumed quickly and then thrown away. There is no message to retain.

## Discussion

Like other genres, pulp has evolved, in terms of its content and the ways this content is perceived and engaged with, as well as the ways in which this content is carried. Its divorce, in many instances, from its original meaning has led to a greater emphasis on, and interest in, its stylistic qualities, and a re-examination of how its various themes have not only reflected particular times, but have sometimes contributed to change. Like other genres, pulp is neither intrinsically ‘good’ nor ‘bad’, conservative nor progressive, influential nor inconsequential; rather, it provides a framework for authors and readers to explore different lines and form their own particular views and attitudes towards the concept, and the term it represents.

Our analysis suggests that the new pulp is more acceptable and appealing to modern audiences. Pulp continues to be written and sold, because there is clearly still a market for entertainment and ‘quick thrills’; indeed, this market appears to be a large one, if its popularity indicated in the LT and Goodreads sites is anything to go by. Although the term ‘pulp’ used to have fairly negative connotations, and when it is applied to old pulp still represents material that can be offensive to today’s audience and tends to be not all that well written, the new pulp has the potential to be seen in a more positive light, with storylines relevant to contemporary social conditions and writing more memorable than previously. At the same time, the new pulp still offers the thrills and spills, the heroes and villains, the larger-than-life worlds familiar to readers of the old pulp – this is why it is still pulp. These ingredients also continue to be applied to a wide range of more specific genres and sub-genres, so that more specific searches might well combine ‘pulp’ with one (or more) of a large number of other genre terms. Today, the use of ‘pulp’ as a search or index term requires no particular ‘value judgement’, so the term should not be excluded from LCGFT on this criterion.

Whilst in the past the simplistic, formulaic storylines, the emphasis on a ‘fun read’ and so forth, were looked down upon, in today’s online world ‘anything goes’, including in library-oriented sites such as LibraryThing. ‘Pulp’ is a common tag in social cataloguing sites because many people value the experiences that reading pulp gives them, and use the term to represent, and gather together, the set of materials that provides these experiences. Thus the tag is used in a positive way, to represent an organising genre that is sought after and valued, and not in the derogatory way the term was often used in the twentieth century. Although some LT users may feel the need to warn their fellow readers about offensive aspects they encounter in some of the older pulp, this does not mean they associate all pulp with such offensiveness.

Libraries too have recalibrated their approach to reading, and see themselves as playing a key role in supporting reading for many different purposes and benefits, not just that of education in a more narrow, formal sense. Leisure reading can help users relax and take much-needed time out from their more stressful worlds, as well as allow them to enjoy new worlds and discover new perspectives ([Ross et al., 2018](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R36)). Reading for fun and for pleasure is not an inferior kind of reading, but potentially as valuable as any other kind. It also does not exclude other outcomes, including educational ones. Furthermore, whatever the outcomes, pulp is an important component of the cultural and social record, and research libraries need to collect and preserve pulp for this additional reason, whether it is to be found online or in print. Some of the new online pulp may well fit into Brantley’s category of ‘new missing books’, the self-published and independently published digital literature that tends to fly under the radar of the collections librarian, just as literal pulp did in the twentieth century ([Brantley, 2012](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R8)).

[Ross (2009)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R35) observes that public libraries are now at something of a crossroads, where the older models of reading are no longer applied, but the way forward, in the face of the profusion of material now available on the internet, is not altogether clear. An ‘anything-goes’ policy would entail librarians abdicating their role as stewards and advisers; on the other hand, as [Ross (2009](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.21#core-R35): 654) argues, the new model needs to conceptualise

> the reader as an active meaning-maker who can be trusted to make choices. We need to get over the suspicion that reading for pleasure is somehow harmful or a waste of time … The goal can still be to recommend ‘the best,’ so long as the best is defined in the context of the particular reader reading at a particular time.

To achieve this goal, and for the readers to more readily find ‘the best’, it would be useful, we suggest, to include a wider range of descriptors in the library catalogue, to cover not only the spectrum of content, but also the full range of experiences that fiction provides, including that provided by pulp fiction.

There seems little reason why descriptors such as ‘pulp’, which are likely to be useful access points for many members of the general reading population, and many library users, should be excluded from today’s indexing vocabularies. While it may not always be easy for the cataloguer or indexer to identify pulp material, especially if it does not explicitly present itself as such, the same could be said for many other genre terms; indeed, genres are by their very nature ‘slippery’ and hard to pin down. Yet they are also key elements in readers’ description of fiction, and in their searching for it. Given the presence of pulp in library collections, and the ongoing use of the term, its omission from LCGFT should be reviewed.
