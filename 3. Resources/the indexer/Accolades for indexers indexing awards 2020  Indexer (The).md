## Abstract

Indexers play a vital role within the publishing industry but are almost invisible, rarely receiving the credit they deserve. Within the indexing societies, however, the achievements of outstanding members of the profession are recognized by a variety of awards. During 2020, three indexing societies – the American Society for Indexing, the Indexing Society of Canada/Société canadienne d’indexation and the Society of Indexers – unable to hold their planned conferences, made virtual ‘presentations’ of awards for indexing and/or for services to their indexing society. This report provides a brief overview of the awards themselves and profiles their latest recipients.

Indexers are the unsung heroes (or more often heroines) of the publishing world; their identity is rarely published and any accolades for excellent indexes appear to praise the publisher or author rather than the indexer. It is the absence of an index, or the inclusion of one that is of little or no use, that is more routinely castigated by reviewers (see ‘Indexes reviewed’ in every issue of _The Indexer_). Within the indexing societies, however, indexers’ achievements are recognized by a variety of awards, some for excellence in the practice of their craft, others for their contribution to the indexing society and the profession more generally. Unable to hold conferences in 2020 due to the COVID-19 situation, three indexing societies made online announcements about the awards they had planned to present in person. Here we look at the origins of these awards and profile the 2020 recipients.

## American Society for Indexing: the Hines Award

First up was the American Society for Indexing (ASI), which announced in May that the 2020 Theodore C. Hines Award for ‘continuous, dedicated and exceptional service to the membership of ASI’ was awarded to Kendra Millis ([Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.40#F1)).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.40#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> Established in 1993, the award was named in honour of Ted Hines (1926–83), who had played a large part in the establishment of ASI. A graduate of Rutgers University, he taught at Rutgers, Columbia University and the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. He was a pioneer in the use of ‘microcomputers’ and ‘microcomputer programs’ in libraries and convened the first formal ASI board meeting in New York in 1968.

Kendra Millis began indexing in 2008, after completing the indexing course offered through the University of California–Berkeley (a course for which she subsequently acted as an instructor). With a background in Russian literature and social philosophy, she left a career in international education to turn freelance so she could return to her home state of Maine to raise her daughter. In addition to her indexing work, she owns a small fibre-related business, which provides her with a welcome creative outlet. According to her acceptance ‘speech’ for the award,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.40#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> attending her first ASI conference in 2009 made all the difference to her career as an indexer and ASI member, and yet she almost did not go to the event. She was hesitant about the cost of flying from Portland, Maine to Portland, Oregon before having any substantial income from indexing. (See also [Millis, 2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.40#core-R1), for an account of her first ten years as an indexer.)

Kendra was a member of the ASI’s Board of Directors for six years, serving as president in 2017–18. Amongst her achievements was setting up the ASI webinar series, one of ASI’s most productive and successful contributions to the indexing community, and organizing the 2018 strategic planning event. She also served as chair of the Marketing Committee, formed the Publishers’ Outreach Committee, and has written articles for _Key Words_ and _The Indexer_. The nomination letters for the award noted Kendra’s ability to handle difficult situations, her calm presence, questions and comments helping to keep meetings on track and productive, and her sense of humour and her ability to model ‘what it is to be a successful indexer who gives back to her profession, whether as an educator, a volunteer or a leader’. Kendra has been extensively involved in several ASI annual conferences, her calm presence and quick thinking proving invaluable in enabling a ‘seamless pivot from an in-person to a virtual conference in 2020’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.40#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup>

## Indexing Society of Canada/Société canadienne d’indexation

In early June, the Indexing Society of Canada/Societé canadienne d’indexation (ISC/SCI) announced the names of three award winners.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.40#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup>

### Ewart–Daveluy Award for Excellence in Indexing

The Ewart–Daveluy Award, inaugurated in 2015, is presented to an individual who has created an index that demonstrates outstanding expertise through a combination of skills, such as the ability to

•

design an index that significantly enhances reader use of the text

•

overcome challenges in creative and useful ways

•

demonstrate insight in addressing the needs of the audience.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.40#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup>

It commemorates two important figures in the history of indexing in Canada. Marie-Claire Daveluy (1880–1968) was a librarian, cataloguer, bibliographer and historian who co-founded and directed the library school at the Université de Montréal and published historical works, children’s fiction and cataloguing rules, including those for subject headings. She also published a monumental indexed work on Jeanne Mance. John S. Ewart (1852?–1933), a respected lawyer who practised in Toronto and then Winnipeg, published _Ewart’s Index of the Statutes_ in several subsequent editions during the 1870s.

The outstanding quality of the submissions allowed two awards to be presented in 2020. Carla DeSantis ([Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.40#F2)) was presented with the award for her index to Heather Bamford’s _Cultures of the fragment: uses of the Iberian manuscript, 1100–1600_ (University of Toronto Press, 2018). As the judging panel noted,

> One of the challenges to indexing this book was to correctly identify the array of proper names, titles, and terms spanning a huge range of languages. Carla’s index accomplishes this. In addition, the major themes are well analysed with consistent and informative sub-entries and entries for a considerable and useful gathering of scattered discussions. Of note is that this is only Carla’s second index!<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.40#fn6" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn6">6</a></sup>

Carla is a freelance editor, indexer and translator based in Toronto, Ontario. With an academic background in language and literature, she has a PhD from the University of Toronto (medieval Latin language and literature; minor: Romance philology), and has published on medieval Latin topics, in addition to holding various contract teaching positions in Latin. Embarking on a freelance career in 2011, she works mainly for university presses and individual scholars, specializing in scholarly and academic texts in the humanities and social sciences, especially multilingual texts, and is the author of the blog _Parchment to PDF_. Initially focusing on editing, she found authors frequently asking her if she could index their books as well as editing them. She found the idea of indexing fascinating, and after training in 2015, she wrote her first index the following year. She really enjoys the unique challenge offered by the indexing process – the creativity it involves and also the organizational aspect.

Anna Olivier ([Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.40#F3)) was presented with the award for her indexes to _Les générations des Soufis:Tabaqat al-sufiyya de Abu Abd al-Rahman, Muhammad b. Husayn al-Sulamī_, translated and presented by Jean-Jacques Thibon (Brill, 2019). The judging panel stated,

> The complex text is analysed and indexed in creative ways. Anna’s indexes were found to be valuable tools for various scholars, including those doing research in the Science of Hadith, and equally useful to linguists, literary critics, and specialists.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.40#fn7" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn7">7</a></sup>

Anna lives in City of Québec, where she works as a writer, editor and indexer, specializing in academic texts. In addition to a PhD in geography (Eastern Europe) from France, her academic background also includes philosophy, history, archaeology and languages. She is a native French speaker (the language in which many of her indexes are written) but also fluent in Czech and English. As someone who has loved books and reading since she first learnt to read, a career immersed in text was an obvious choice. In 2006 she established Athéna Rédaction, specializing in writing and editing scientific texts, and in 2008 set up her indexing business, Index à la page. She has also established a publishing business, Éditions Zemë, which reflects her geographical background, focusing on spatial memory, land art and Québécois regional identity. Not surprisingly, she finds she has insufficient time to devote to this project. Outside work, Anna’s other interests include music (piano), martial arts (karate) and dance.

## Tamarack Award for Volunteers

The Tamarack Award was instituted in 2004 by Ruth Pincoe, then ISC/SCI president, and is presented annually to recognize members who go ‘above and beyond the call of duty’ in their volunteer work for the Society. The physical acknowledgement of the award is a small version of a tamarack-twig decoy created by the Cree people of the James Bay area ([Figure 4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.40#F4)).

The recipient of the 2020 award was Margaret de Boer ([Figure 5](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.40#F5)), in recognition of her contribution and commitment to the Society, as president and past-president, and for the additional time and service she has spent on many various committees. She currently (2020) still serves on the ISC/SCI executive as past-president.

Margaret’s colleagues had the following to say about her:

> She’s calm, thoughtful, and very fair when the time comes to make a decision. Her leadership was always kind-hearted, to the benefit to the executive as well as the full ISC/SCI membership.
> 
> Margaret is many things – smart, thorough, thoughtful and courageous; she is an independent thinker.
> 
> Margaret’s diligence and thoroughness are assets to our meetings as she pushes us to ensure that we’re being clear, precise, and productive on whatever issues we deal with.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.40#fn8" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn8">8</a></sup>

Margaret de Boer is a freelance indexer living in Toronto, with degrees in both sociology (BA) and elementary education and school librarianship (BEd). With 30 years’ experience in television news indexing, newspaper database indexing and back-of-the book indexing, her broadly based subject knowledge ranges from Indigenous content to economics, environmental studies, political science and psychology. Margaret (along with Anna Olivier) was part of the team of six indexers collaborating (remotely) on the indexing of the massive Truth and Reconciliation Commission report.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.40#fn9" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn9">9</a></sup>

## Society of Indexers: the Betty Moys Award

Later in June, the Society of Indexers (SI) announced that the 2020 recipient of the Betty Moys Award was Melina Costi, with highly commended certificates going to Melina’s brother, Dino Costi, and Non Lowri Evans (who has recently copy-edited the latest edition of the SI training course – discussed by Ann Hudson in this issue of _The Indexer_, 399–417). The award was established in 2002 in memory of the late Betty Moys MBE (1928–2002), distinguished law librarian and indexer and formerly the Society’s honorary treasurer, who left a generous legacy to the Society to provide an annual prize for a new indexer. Betty always made a point of seeking out new indexers at every conference, making them welcome and encouraging them in their new careers. Although the legacy came to an end after ten years, winners receives a year’s free SI membership, together with a certificate. The prize is presented to the best newly accredited indexer in the previous calendar year, the criteria being high marks in all the test papers, with comments of markers and practical indexing assignment advisers also being taken into consideration.

Melina Costi is a professional business writer and copy-editor with a background in marketing management. She is co-author of _The positive leader_ (FT Publishing, 2016) and _The creative thinking handbook_ (Kogan Page, 2019). Only when confronted with preparing an index for an early self-published book did she first discover that indexing existed as a real occupation. It immediately struck her as a ‘good fit’ for her conscientious temperament, as well as being the perfect excuse to always have her nose in a book. Flexibility around the children was an added bonus. Juggling the training course with work and childcare meant that it took her some time to complete the course but her perseverance certainly paid off. Her practical indexing assignment (the final course item – an index to a full-length book) was judged to be ‘a good, useable index’, and both choice and wording of entries and accuracy and consistency were deemed to be ‘excellent’. Melina holds a first-class BSc (Hons) degree in business studies from City University, London, and hopes to specialize in business, personal-development and higher-education subjects once her indexing career is fully under way.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.40#fn10" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn10">10</a></sup>
