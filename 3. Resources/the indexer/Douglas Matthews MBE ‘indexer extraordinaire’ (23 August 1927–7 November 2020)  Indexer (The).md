How often do indexers receive obituaries in the national press and accolades on social media?<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> It’s probably unprecedented. But Douglas Matthews was no ordinary indexer; the recipient of several awards and honours, he has variously been described as a ‘king among indexers’, ‘every author’s dream indexer’ and ‘the nonpareil of indexers’. His passing leaves a significant gap in our profession.

In common with many other indexers, Douglas came to indexing as a second career, but few can have devoted so much energy to both their employment and freelance careers. Indexing was a career he pursued for over 60 years, initially ‘moonlighting’ from his main job as a librarian, and later as a full-time freelance indexer for over 25 years. He completed his last index, for a study of the first Anglo-Afghan war, only a few months before his death.

Douglas was born in August 1927 to Benjamin and Mary (née Pearson) Matthews, in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, where he attended Acklam Hall School. After reading geography at Durham University he trained as a librarian at London’s North-Western Polytechnic (now part of London Metropolitan University). The first ten years of his career (1952–62) were spent in the library of the India Office, where he recognized that service in a research library suited his temperament: ‘a library functions much better if the staff are prepared to act as intermediaries between the collections and the users … I always found this to be a most satisfying part of my professional duties and was rewarded with the friendship and confidence of scholars from many parts of the world’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> Such friendships were an enduring feature of his life; Claire [Tomalin (2011)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R19) was ‘especially pleased when my old friend Douglas Matthews agreed to make the index’.

It was during a year’s sabbatical (1956–7) in the Foreign Acquisitions Department of the Royal Library in Stockholm that Douglas found himself in the right place at the right time to compile his first index, for a history professor needing a native English speaker for a book on power politics before the First World War. Like many indexers at this time, Douglas basically learnt on the job, applying the cataloguing and subject indexing skills that had been honed through his library training and experience. Looking back at that first index many years later, however, he felt that it might actually have been his best work, as it was produced in ideal conditions: ‘I had the unrepeated experience of more than enough time, and grant-aided support for the book, including generous payment for the index’ (quoted in [Bell, 1997](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R2): 165).

After the India Office, Douglas spent several years at the Home Office Library (where several more indexes came his way) before moving to the London Library (the largest independent lending library in the world) as deputy librarian in 1962. In 1980 he was appointed librarian, at a time when the library was taking its first steps into computerizing its catalogue – an area where his skills as an indexer were to prove invaluable. As a wholly independent library, attached to no parent institution, its administration is entirely autonomous and, as Douglas observed, ‘the librarian is perforce a man of many parts’, concerned with everything from leaking roofs to problems with accounting systems. Fortunately, his years at the Home Office had equipped him with considerable administrative skills ([Bell, 2000](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R3): 208).

Douglas was not only an expert in his field but also a warm and approachable colleague who provided invaluable support to staff, library members and contacts in the publishing industry throughout his time at the institution. John Wells likened him to a maitre d’ and he is fondly remembered for his characteristic paternalistic management style – to the staff he was always ‘Mr Matthews’ or ‘DM’ – and his equally characteristic avuncular personality in his dealings with the ‘members’ (i.e. readers) of the library. His was a frequent presence in the main issue hall, greeting and chatting with the regulars, always remembering their current projects and interests, and frequently darting off to the stacks to fetch them things they were having trouble locating, or, more often, things they didn’t even realize existed. Many grateful authors recorded their thanks for his help (see [Table 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#T1)).

The London Library proved to be a splendid base for an indexer: ‘writers completing their research would ask their helpful librarian how they might find an indexer … and who could be better placed to carry out the supplementary research that an indexer needs?’ ([Bell, 1997](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R2): 165). As he became known to publishers, further requests for indexes came his way. And his daily commute from Lewes to London gave him two hours a day of ‘completely insulated quiet’ (according to [Bell, 1997](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R2): 165) for indexing (was he travelling first class?). Working on cards or slips, and juggling a precarious pile of proofs, it was a far cry from the convenience of a modern laptop. Only once was he asked what he was doing by a fellow passenger. But travelling with a partly completed index can sometimes be a risky business; at a meeting of the Society of Indexers Sussex group in 2004 Douglas recounted the nightmare experience of accidentally abandoning an almost completed large index in a carrier bag in a lay-by on a family holiday. Luckily it was retrieved the next day after a very sleepless night!

His retirement in 1993 allowed him to establish himself as a full-time freelance indexer, working 30 or more hours a week to put ‘jam on the pension’. These hours seem to have been spent very productively, judging by his output (estimated to be between 600 and 1,000 indexes in total). Judith Flanders reported on Twitter that he once confessed to her that he just invented the time it took him to complete an index: ‘I work fast, and if I charged for that it would look like I wasn’t trying!’ At times, such was the demand for his indexing skills that he described himself as ‘intolerably busy … to the point where hysteria has taken over from panic. I daresay you know the feeling’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup>

In 1994 he joined the Society of Indexers, and, having been given a PC and a printer as a retirement present from the London Library, he now moved into the digital age, abandoning cards and slips in favour of Macrex. But in advising authors about indexing software, he reminded them that it was the intellectual work of the human brain that was the key to a well-constructed index: ‘There can be no shortcutting that basic, dogged, analytical reading of the whole work and then arranging it to make the text easy for consultation. That is what takes the time, not the manner of recording the entries’ ([Matthews, 1996](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R11)). His indexes, so readily identifiable at first glance as ‘a Douglas Matthews index’ (see [Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#F2)), remained exemplars of concision, efficacy and wit. He was a master of analysis, interpretation and creativity, reading between the lines to provide index entries that a lesser mortal might not have considered. In Laurence Olivier’s ([1982](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R16)) autobiography, for example, the index entry ‘Esmond, Jill, supplanted by Vivien Leigh’ refers to Olivier’s furtive affair with Leigh while still married to his first wife, though she herself appears in only a couple of passing mentions as ‘Jill’.

Being very well known in the literary world, Douglas was the obvious person for the BBC to consult when planning a five-part radio series on indexes and indexing in 1999. He jumped at the chance to take part in one of the programmes as ‘it seemed a good opportunity to raise the profile of our modest profession’ ([Matthews, 1999](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R12): 172). This took the form of a conversation between Douglas, Richard Holmes (whose biography of Coleridge he had recently indexed) and the interviewer, Christopher Bigsby of the University of East Anglia. He found it surprisingly challenging to explain the indexing process to an unseen audience of radio listeners ‘who had probably never given a moment’s thought to the question’ and was delighted to learn that Richard Holmes regarded the arrival of the finished index as ‘a great moment’.

Indexing was much more than simply a way for Douglas to put ‘jam on the pension’; it was obvious from the radio broadcast that he derived great pleasure from his work. As he said, ‘I would not do it otherwise’ ([Matthews, 1999](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R12): 173). He also appreciated the educational value of indexing that had been a constant throughout his career. ‘In many ways my education really began when I took up indexing. It has taken me into parts of the written landscape I might never have visited’ ([Matthews, 2001](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R13): 141). His regular editors were always struck by the incredible range of his knowledge, which was also evident during his time at the London Library. Long before the lazy days of simply Googling everything, he was a skilled and instinctive user of reference sources for the meticulous fact-checking of his indexes.

His enthusiasm for indexing, the pleasure he gained from it and the pride he took in it were amply illustrated in his talk at the Society of Indexers’ Cambridge conference in the year 2000. He particularly enjoyed feeling part of a team, especially for large projects such as the 12-volume _Letters of Charles Dickens_ ([House et al., 1965–2002](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R7)), which he joined at volume 6: ‘It has been a privilege to be part of the team, and as the years have gone by, to have been welcomed into it’ ([Matthews, 2001](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R13): 137). The index to the Dickens letters was one that Douglas was particularly proud of, though he was not sure that he came to like Dickens better as a result of working through all his correspondence. However, he admitted to being astounded at Dickens’s industry and energy. In contrast, when he indexed the eight-volume _Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson_ ([Booth and Mehew, 1994–5)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R5), he developed a real affection for his subject. He found the letters to be ‘a revelation and a joy. I could hardly bear to wait for the next volume when I had finished one’ ([Matthews, 2001](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R13): 138).

Douglas compiled several other monumental indexes, including the papers of Daniel Defoe (44 volumes), and the later and posthumous works of Isaiah Berlin, but he also indexed collections of letters that were simpler and more fun, and aimed at a less academic audience, such as those of P. G. Wodehouse and Dirk Bogarde. Although perhaps best known for his indexes to historical and biographical works, both academic and popular, he ranged widely across the disciplines: ‘I could list scores of wonderful books that have come my way … I enjoy all the types of books I index – historical, biographical, literary, art, religion, philosophy, and more “scientific” books that I can understand as a layman’ (quoted in [Bell, 1997](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R2): 166). It is no wonder that as a member of the Society of Sussex Authors he was well positioned to set their Christmas quizzes.

Douglas always felt it important to point out discrepancies to authors, or to clarify particular points. In referring to the letters of Kingsley Amis ([Leader, 2000](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R8)), he noted, ‘My suggested annotation appears in the printed volume, bringing that special glow of satisfaction that comes from being able to make contributions of this kind’ ([Matthews, 2001](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R13): 137). In her book on the Gunpowder Plot, Antonia [Fraser (1996)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R6) thanked her ‘Indexer Extraordinary’, who ‘not only performed his task with his accustomed dexterity but also supplied information about the Guy Fawkes “celebrations” in Lewes’. Over the years, he built up excellent relationships with many authors for the quality of his index entries and his scrupulous attention to detail. Richard [Ollard (2003)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R15) was indebted to him ‘for the safety net of his omniscience’, while Jeremy [Lewis (1998)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R9) ‘discovered – like many grateful authors before me – that, as an indexer, Douglas Matthews goes far beyond the conventional call of duty; for which I am very thankful’.

Douglas generally had very good relationships with the authors he worked with. On one occasion he had enjoyed indexing the book so much that he declined to take a fee. He had ‘romped through it in no time and received my reward from the sheer pleasure of it. This nearly involved me in a duel with the author, who insisted on paying me, but eventually settled for several bottles of good Scotch instead’ (quoted in [Bell, 1997](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R2): 166).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup> On one occasion, however, while indexing the diaries of James Lee-Milne, he came across a rather derogatory mention of himself in connection with a disputed entry in his index to Kenneth Rose’s biography of George V. Ever the professional, he duly indexed it. As he explained when giving a talk to the Society of Authors ([Matthews, 1993](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R10)), it was important to maintain objectivity and not allow one’s prejudices to intrude:

> Demand neutrality: it is not the function of the indexer to make value-judgements. I recently indexed _Mein Kampf_ … it was tempting to slant the entries, as under ‘Hitler, Adolf’, for example, to make a subheading ‘poisonous hatred of Jews’… The neutral ‘anti-Semitism’ is exact and, I think, more effective because cooler … the indexer merely directs the reader where to look.

Similarly, when indexing Frank Muir’s _Irreverent companion to social history_ ([1976](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R14)) he largely resisted the author’s injunction ‘to make the index as jokey as I cared, because I found that when I did, it killed the joke in the text’. However, one of the occasional ‘flights into the airy and light-hearted’ that he did allow himself was the subheading ‘roast Lamb’ under ‘audiences’. This related to the audience reaction to the opening night of a Charles Lamb farce, which was hissed and booed. Douglas ‘found this irresistible, and phrased the index entry accordingly, but it is sufficiently cryptic in itself to cause the reader to look up the text and see what it means’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup>

Douglas also had firm views on ‘the value of the index as a self-contained reference tool’, a feature he always aimed for, especially in biographical indexes, and he spent a great deal of time ‘expanding names and hunting down identities’. When he drew a blank he would use an epithet, such as ‘Robinson (funeral director)’ or ‘Wilson (wig maker)’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#fn6" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn6">6</a></sup> In correspondence with Hazel Bell on the problems of biographical indexing, he explained that his normal practice was ‘to subdivide by order of occurrence rather than alphabetically … because the terms (unlike scientific ones, which are precise and specific) are adopted, even arbitrary, and so seem no more helpful to the reader than any other order’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#fn7" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn7">7</a></sup> He felt this approach to be more logical than alphabetical arrangement.

He also corresponded with Hazel on the subject of indexing fiction. He found the idea thought-provoking, and although he thought ‘it might be quite fun to do’, he confessed to feeling ‘curiously uncomfortable’ about analysing creative writing in this way, seeing indexes as being concerned with facts rather than fiction. He feared that ‘teasing out entries from the text is damaging rather than enhancing, like pulling out the theads from a patterned carpet to see what makes the design’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#fn8" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn8">8</a></sup>

Having a Douglas Matthews index seems to have become something of a selling point for many authors. In an article for _The Guardian_ about Salman Rushdie’s memoirs (published without an index), the then president of the Society of Indexers, John [Sutherland (2012)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R18), drew attention to the fact that indexers, even great ones, are rarely acknowledged by authors. Douglas was certainly an exception to that rule. In marking Douglas’s 90th birthday, Christopher [Phipps (2017)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R17) averred that

> Douglas Matthews must easily win the competition for that most coveted of prizes for our lonely, long-distance profession: the named mention in the acknowledgements section. There he is often billed as ‘prince among indexers’, but at 90 he is surely due for promotion to ‘king among …’ or ‘emperor among …’. He is the epitome of what we must hope is not a dying breed, the scholarly librarian turned indexer.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#fn9" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn9">9</a></sup>

Douglas could also be described as the ‘reader as indexer’. As he told Hazel [Bell (1997](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R2): 166), ‘reading is an essential part of my life; reading closely in the purposive way that indexing requires merely enhances that activity’. He felt that ‘some books are such a pleasure to read that you almost feel you should pay the publishers, not the other way round’ (quoted in [Bell, 2000](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R3): 211). He was certainly very much part of the literary world. For many years he was a member of the Lewes Literary Society Committee, persuading well-known writers to travel to Lewes, and later joined the Society of Sussex Authors. He was also a trustee of the Royal Literary Fund, a charity that has been helping authors in financial difficulties (both the famous and the less well known) for over two centuries. For ten years (2004–14) he was a registrar of the fund, regarding it as ‘one of my more worthwhile activities’. Being able to give direct help to people who had fallen on hard times, usually through no fault of their own, brought him immense satisfaction.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#fn10" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn10">10</a></sup>

A search using Google Books highlights how many authors have had very kind words for Douglas as their indexer, and as someone who often went over and above the basic call of duty for his clients. [Table 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#T1) also gives a glimpse into the range of his work and some of the celebrated authors for whom he worked.

Douglas was an exceedingly modest man who never sought the limelight, but his achievements did not go unrecognized. In 1999 he became an honorary fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, confessing later that he was

> still a little bemused as to why the Royal Society of Literature made me a Fellow, but delighted that they did. It is very unusual for this honour to be granted to non-authors, and the reasons given to me when I have discreetly enquired are clouded in general terms like ‘service to literature’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#fn11" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn11">11</a></sup>

Five years later the Society of Indexers presented him with its Carey Award in recognition of his services to indexing ([Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#F3)), and in 2013 he was made an MBE in the New Year’s Honours List as ‘Literary Indexer: for services to Literature’. What is perhaps surprising is that he was never awarded the Wheatley Medal for excellence in indexing, though his index to Peter Ackroyd’s ([1990](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R1)) biography of Dickens was commended by the judges as being ‘lively, full of character, well organized. And as distinctive as the book it so ably complements’ (quoted in [Bell, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R4): 18).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#fn12" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn12">12</a></sup> In a letter to Hazel Bell he admitted to ‘a rueful feeling about it: rather like a contestant coming fourth in an Olympics event.

In correspondence with Hazel Bell about why Wheatley Medal panels rarely seemed to give much attention to what she calls ‘narrative indexes’, Douglas suggested that

> there seem to be a number of reasons, mainly to do with having to consider abstract rather than concrete matter, and trying to assess on the basis of value judgement rather than straight, clear fact. It must be so much easier to judge a legal, technological, scientific or medical work than a philosophical, literary or even biographical one, where in a sense the indexer is an interpreter, not just a reporter of the text.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#fn14" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn14">14</a></sup>

What of the man himself? Frugal by nature, his one great personal indulgence was his membership of the Garrick Club, where he enjoyed a monthly lunch with literary and theatrical figures in a more relaxed and convivial atmosphere than the more hidebound St James’s clubs that are the neighbours of the London Library. In retirement, his long-standing role as a registrar at the Royal Literary Fund was an important continuing lifeline for him to the literary world. That he should choose this charity, which plays such a key role in providing financial help to writers in need, was also characteristic of his generosity of spirit and his willingness to provide support.

Douglas married Sarah Williams in 1968; the marriage was dissolved in 1991. He is survived by Sarah and their two daughters.

Unfortunately, in the subsequent paperback edition the subheadings were ‘meaninglessly scrambled by an insensitive computer (A. N. Other’s) in the repagination’ ([Bell, 1997](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.2#core-R2): 165).

Letter from Douglas Matthews to Hazel Bell, 7 November 1991. To some extent this may also have been a self-fulfilling prophecy, with fewer such texts being submitted, perhaps coupled with a lack of awareness amongst publishers that the award existed.
