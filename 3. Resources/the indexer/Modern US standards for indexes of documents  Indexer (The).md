## Abstract

Pilar Wyman and Judi Gibbs, members of the US National Information Standards Organization (NISO) Criteria for Indexes Working Group, report on the recent update of the _ANSI/NISO Z39.4-2021 Criteria for Indexes._ These standards provide guidelines for the content, organization and presentation of indexes used for the retrieval of documents and parts of documents. They had not been revised since 1984 and now include modern indexing techniques.

The US National Information Standards Organization (NISO) Criteria for Indexes project on indexing standards recently completed its work updating the American national standards for indexes. The updated standard, _ANSI/NISO Z39.4-2021 Criteria for Indexes_, was approved by ANSI (American National Standards Institute) on 12 July 2021 and is available online at [https://www.niso.org/publications/z394-2021-indexes](https://www.niso.org/publications/z394-2021-indexes), where a direct link to the interactive electronic document as a PDF can be found.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.6#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> For an earlier report on the updating process, see [Wyman (2021)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.6#core-R5).

As group member [John Magee (2021)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.6#core-R2), director of indexing and vocabulary for Gale, a Cengage Group business, recently reported in _Key Words_, the newsletter of the American Society for Indexing (ASI), ‘ANSI/NISO Z39.4 is intended to provide guidelines for indexers and users of indexes such as publishers, database producers, librarians, and others. However, it is particularly designed for persons who have substantial knowledge and experience related to indexes.’

In addition to NISO staff, the working group included 16 members from several American library associations, libraries, commercial database vendors, publishers and ASI. The members included database and taxonomy managers, directors and analysts of metadata, librarians, content managers, information specialists, reference librarians and, last but not least, indexers, including the present authors and Janet Perlman.

In this article, we provide an overview of the standards, note significant features and items of interest, and explain how the working group conducted its review.

## Overview

_ANSI/NISO Z39.4-2021 Criteria for Indexes_ provides guidelines for the content, organization and presentation of indexes used for the retrieval of documents and parts of documents. It deals with the principles of indexing regardless of the type of material indexed, the indexing method used, the medium of the index, or the method of presentation for searching. It emphasizes three processes essential for all indexes: comprehensive design, vocabulary management and syntax.

The standard includes the following numbered sections:

It also includes a glossary, additional resources and a bibliography. Last, but not least, an index is also provided.

As [Magee (2021)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.6#core-R2) said, the first six sections are introductory, while the sections that follow are detailed. ‘The standard is technical in nature, but it is not prescriptive in a “one size fits all” manner as to exactly how every index should be produced.’ The standard says, ‘Decisions should be based on the needs, habits, and preference of users.’ Similarly, regarding index display, it states that ‘displays should be arranged in an order helpful to the intended audience and should also follow methodical ordering’.

An example of how the standard for indexes has been updated is the treatment of ‘Headings and locators’, section 9. In the previous version, technical report NISO TR02-1997, _Guidelines for indexes and related information retrieval devices_, the ‘Headings and locators’ section was called ‘Headings, entries, and search statements’, and included five subsections: ‘Entries in displayed indexes’, ‘Syntax in displayed indexes’, ‘Weighted terms’, ‘Locators in displayed indexes’ and ‘Syntax in non-displayed indexes’. This section now includes three subsections: ‘Headings’, ‘Syntax’ and ‘Locators in indexes’. The latter two subsections also include the sub-subsections ‘Syntax in displayed indexes’ and ‘Syntax in non-displayed indexes’, and ‘Locators for printed or electronic documents’ and ‘Locators for documents in other media’. Like true indexers, the working group consolidated material under appropriate headings.

The treatment of index display is another example of major updates. In the previous version, ‘Display of an index’ was called ‘Display of index arrays’ and included four subsections: ‘Introductory notes for indexes’, ‘Index display in print media’ (which had nine subsubsections), ‘Index display in electronic media’ (two subsubsections) and ‘Electronic manuscripts’. This section, now number 10 in the sequence, now includes five subsections: ‘Explanatory notes for indexes’, ‘Index display in print media’ (which has roughly the same nine sub-subsections as before), ‘Index display in electronic media’ (and the same two sub-subsections as before), ‘Electronic manuscripts’, and ‘Locators’ (which has two sub-subsections, ‘Methods of emphasizing locators in indexes’ and ‘Presentation of other identifying data’).

Again, like true indexers, the working group called out items of importance which were otherwise buried or hidden from view. Locators, whatever their format, are key for accurate indexing so we made sure they were addressed, for all types of documents and media.

The References and Bibliography were also significantly updated. The new standard includes both ‘Normative references’ (section 3) as well as ‘Additional resources’ (Appendix A) and a Bibliography. Per NISO templates, ‘Normative references’ includes two references culled from the Bibliography. Appendix A includes the ‘Additional resources’, which lists basic source materials (such as Nancy Mulvany’s _Indexing books_ (2005) and ASI’s _Best practices_ guide (2015)); ‘Additional reading’; ‘Taxonomy and thesaurus resources’; ‘Vocabularies and thesauri by subject area’; and ‘Metadata standards’. The focus is on North American material, but also includes resources from around the world.

Throughout the review and update work, in addition to quality-indexing benchmarks familiar to professional indexers, the working group also made sure to consider accessibility, bias, electronic display, non-display and hyperlinked locators. Other strengths in the standard include the recommendations for natural word order and cross-references.

## Natural word order

This standard advocates the use of natural word order in headings (8.2.4.1). ‘In general, natural word order should be preferred for headings’. For example:

> deciduous trees \[not: trees, deciduous\]

An acceptable alternative is:

> trees
> 
> deciduous
> 
> evergreen

For articles at the beginning of titles of works, the standard states (8.2.5.4), ‘An initial article should not be omitted or transposed to the end of the title’:

> Das Kapital (Marx) \[not: Kapital (Marx); Kapital, Das (Marx)\]
> 
> The Tempest \[not: Tempest; Tempest, The\]

For articles at the beginning of organization names, the standard says (8.2.5.2), ‘Initial articles that are part of the commonly used form should not be omitted or transposed’:

> Der Blaue Adler (association) \[not: Blaue Adler, Der (association)\]
> 
> The Club (London) \[not: Club (London) or Club, The (London)\]
> 
> Eli Lilly and Co. \[not: Lilly, Eli, and Co.\]
> 
> UNESCO \[not: United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization\]

For articles or prepositions that are an integral part of a geographical name, the standard says (8.2.5.3), ‘it should be retained’:

> Des Moines
> 
> Las Vegas
> 
> Los Angeles
> 
> The Dalles
> 
> The Hague

Regarding alphabetic arrangement, the standard says (11.4), ‘Initial articles in any language are ignored in sorting titles, first lines, topical subject terms, and names of corporate bodies … Exceptions are initial articles that form an integral part of a proper name’:

> El Paso
> 
> Le Guin, Ursula K.
> 
> Los Angeles
> 
> The Dalles
> 
> The Gap, Inc.

## Cross-references

Another strength of this standard is its guidance on where cross-references should be located and the examples it provides (8.8.1.3). ‘Cross-references should be attached to the heading or subheading from which they refer’:

> housing
> 
> apartments. _see_ apartments
> 
> duplexes, 5, 10
> 
> regulations governing, 10–15, 19, 21
> 
> single-family homes, 25, 27, 29
> 
> zoning. _see_ zoning

The standard notes (11.7) that cross-references are not part of any heading and do not affect the location of the entry or subentry in an alphabetical sequence.

The standard is clear that double postings should be used in lieu of cross-references when there are no subentries (8.8.1.1). It also illustrates the use of cross-references to multiple terms or headings (8.8.1.2) and in electronic displayed indexes (8.8.1.4).

When closely associated terms are combined to form compound terms, the standard recommends that the terms not chosen as the lead term should be linked with a cross-reference. ‘Cross-references link synonymous, equivalent, broader, narrower, and other related terms’ (9.2.1). For example:

> awards. _see_ honors and awards
> 
> evil. _see_ good and evil

## The index to the standard

The index to the _ANSI/NISO Criteria for Indexes_ standard is a comprehensive subject index in indented format sorted alphabetically and with blank spaces between alphabetic groups. Main headings are in lower case. There are two levels of entry, judicious use of cross references and appropriate double posting. The index looks and reads like a traditional book index.

Entry locators, however, are hyperlinked section numbers. The introductory note explains, ‘Locators indicate section numbers.’

This index for the standard serves as a model index. Thus locators are hyperlinked. The user can click on locators and go directly to the relevant section, subsection, sub-subsection, sub-sub-subsection or other called out paragraph or component of the standard. This type of interactivity and linking is key for usability in modern indexes and for indexes to electronic documents.

The index was written by working group member and fellow book indexer Janet Perlman. It was released with the draft of the standard when it went out to public review. Few comments or critical feedback on the index were received. Many thanks to Janet for her diligence. It was a pleasure to work with her.

## Closing

Indeed, it was a pleasure to participate in this working group. We now anticipate a Z39.4 standing committee for the indexes standard. A call for participation from the working group and others is expected shortly.
