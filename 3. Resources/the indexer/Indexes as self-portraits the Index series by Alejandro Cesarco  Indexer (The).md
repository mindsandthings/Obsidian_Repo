## Abstract

Dutch indexer Caroline Diepeveen shares her impressions of Alejandro Cesarco’s Index series, which was presented at a solo exhibition at the Witte de With Centre of Contemporary Art in Rotterdam (Netherlands) from 8 September 2019 to 5 January 2020.

It is not often that visual-arts exhibitions are reviewed in _The Indexer_, but this is an exhibition of Alejandro Cesarco’s Index series and therefore may be of special interest to its readers. The project is an ongoing series of indexes created by the artist that started in the year 2000. The books belonging to these indexes do not exist; each index references an imaginary book he hasn’t written and most probably never will.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.19#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> A _London Review of Books_ blog by Gill Partington therefore calls them ‘fake indexes’, which I think sounds rather too dismissive.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.19#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> These are real indexes all right, but presented as visual art. They have lost their original purpose of pointing the reader towards relevant passages in a text (because there is no text to refer to), but in my view this does not make them fake. These are just indexes with a different purpose.

Each index addresses a different theme or topic and hints at a possible narrative within it. Their subject matter ranges from large ideas, such as memory or the repetition of romantic archetypes, to emotions, such as mourning or regret. They tend to have a rather philosophical inclination.

The artist Alejandro Cesarco was born in Montevideo in 1975 and lives and works in New York. His work is influenced by literature and literary theory, which may explain his interest in indexes. The series started with a work that is simply called _Index_. It was made in the year 2000 and consists of a series of 12 prints, each containing an index page, and it is basically a portrait of the artist – an index to his biography, you could say. It made me wonder whether, since it was made some 20 years ago, the index might need updating by now. Perhaps this was very much the thought of an indexer.

The exhibition itself is presented in a very sober way ([Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.19#F1)). There is not much to distract the viewer, one is simply drawn into the indexes. They are intriguing enough, not only to an indexer. I visited the exhibition with two companions, both non-indexers. They were also quite fascinated. What was the meaning of this? What was the artist trying to say? One of my companions had the brilliant idea of putting the indexes into page-number order to see whether a logical story would unfold. I resisted the temptation to try this out. To do this would feel rather like an act of vandalism to me. I think I prefer the mystery that surrounds these indexes, the somewhat alienating experience of looking at these indexes, reading bits of them, without being able to relate them to a text, and wondering what the artist is trying to convey here, without deconstructing them to pieces.

What do I make of them as an indexer? When we look at them, the indexes seem real enough. Even though there is no text to relate to, the index entries seem well chosen and consistent. There are no long strings of page locators. Entries are sorted sometimes in ways that differ from what a professional indexer would do, for example sorting by definite articles like ‘L’ and ‘La’ ([Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.19#F2)).

The ordering of sub-entries is often done according indexing rules (ignoring prepositions) but sometimes appears to follow no rule at all. An example of this is the index entry ‘artist’ ([Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.19#F3)).

And his use of cross-references is also a bit hard to follow. For example, one index has the entry ‘furniture, 7, _see also_ décor’ and ‘décor 7, _see also_ furniture’. There are plenty of appropriate _see also_ cross-references, though (see [Figure 4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.19#F4)), which makes one wonder if the artist is playing a joke on us here or trying making some kind of statement. I have no idea why the artist is cross-referencing to ‘Derrida’ from the entry ‘trace’, but that may be due to my lack of intimate knowledge of Derrida’s philosophical thought.

I found some of his entries quite humorous, such as the entry for ‘waiting’ (see [Figure 5](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.19#F5)). One of my companions, however, said she got the impression that the artist is a somewhat depressed person, although she could not really put her finger on why she got that impression. We concluded that this might have been caused by the artist’s choice of first entries. I found two indexes starting with ‘abandonment’; two other indexes started with ‘abduction’ and one with ‘absence’. This perhaps caused a first impression of sadness. I often give the first entry of my indexes a lot of thought and I know some other indexers do as well. I always thought it rather silly of me to give a first index entry so much thought, but is it perhaps not so silly after all?

In short, this exhibition is intriguing and food for thought for indexers and non-indexers alike. I have no idea why this exhibition ended up in the Netherlands, which does not have much of an ‘index culture’ in contemporary publishing, and where even academic publishers are perfectly happy producing books without indexes or with a name index only. This is a very sad situation, especially since it used to be very different in the thriving early centuries of the Dutch publishing industry, and Dutch Enlightenment academics like Erasmus and Scaliger did care very much about indexing. We lost this tradition somehow. And perhaps nowadays, because of our very rich visual-arts tradition, we are only interested in indexes when presented as visual art. And as Rotterdam is the city of Erasmus, after all, it seems appropriate that it ended up there. I am not sure if it did much to promote indexing in the Netherlands, as we were virtually alone when we visited the exhibition on one of the last days it was being shown. This was in contrast to the ground-floor exhibitions that drew quite sizable numbers of visitors. I am very grateful to the Society of Indexers for sharing a Facebook posting on this exhibition. Without it, I would not have known about it. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit, and would have hated to miss it. Therefore, should this exhibition come anywhere near you, do go and visit it!
