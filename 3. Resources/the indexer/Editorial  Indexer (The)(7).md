Publication: The Indexer: The International Journal of Indexing

Volume 38, Number 2

I am very excited to be publishing three research articles in this issue – Professor Wang’s analysis of index compilation and research in China, Lei Zhang’s study of inter-indexer consistency, and Mary Russell and Max McMaster’s analysis of Australian Commonwealth annual report indexes. There have been calls for more indexing research for a long time, and I am hopeful that these papers will be followed by many more. It is particularly nice to see a combination of academic and practitioner research and, in some cases, to be able to connect the dots between research and practice. For example, Lei Zhang’s study dovetails nicely with another article in this issue by the Hansard indexing team (Emily Dix, Rosalind Guldner and Kate Laukys) on their process for maintaining consistency amongst multiple indexers.

Professor Wang’s article is an English translation of a paper originally published in the special issue of _China Index_ that followed the China Society of Indexers (CSI) conference held in Shanghai in 2018. Due to the length of the article, we will publish only the English translation in the print version of this issue, but you can find the original Chinese article along with the translation in the digital version. Translating this article was not an easy task, and I am particularly grateful to Ann Kingdom for generously and expertly helping to make it as accessible as possible for an English-language audience.

Also in this issue, Walter Greulich begins a series of articles on indexing using Microsoft Word. The idea of indexing in Word may seem strange to many professional indexers who use dedicated indexing software. However, Walter notes some good reasons for considering Word as an indexing tool and will explain methods for using it in detail throughout the series.

After you have tackled the heavier work of reading research and practical instructions, please enjoy a few shorter contributions. Michael Robertson offers us an English translation of a Latin introduction to an index from the fourteenth century. I think that even after all this time, the words of this early indexer will touch a chord with modern-day indexers – and perhaps make them just a little jealous that they can’t write similar introductions to their work! As Caroline Diepeveen notes in her article on Alejandro Cesarco’s Index series, it is not often that reviews of visual arts are included in _The Indexer_. However, I could not resist Caroline’s kind offer to share her impressions of this exhibition. While you’re (hopefully) relaxed and smiling from considering the idea of indexes as art, continue on to Frances Lennie’s delightful review of Jack Lyon’s _Tales of a Pen Master: Zen Stories for Editors, Writers and Other Publishing Professionals_. Some of you may know Jack as the developer of DEXembed, but, as with many of us in the indexing community, he has many talents. I hope that Frances’s review will inspire you to pick up his book and enjoy a few Zen moments in the midst of a busy world.

Finally, I have included my report on the Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand (BSANZ) conference. I was delighted to meet many people at this conference interested in indexes and to find unexpected intersections between indexing and the various topics presented. Might there be other connections that we could develop with like-minded folk such as those in this society? I will continue to explore this, and if you are attending similar events, please consider sharing your experiences with readers of this journal.
