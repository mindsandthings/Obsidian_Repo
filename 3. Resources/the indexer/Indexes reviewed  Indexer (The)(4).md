Volume 38, Number 4

These extracts from reviews do not pretend to represent a complete survey of all reviews in journals and newspapers. We offer only a selection from quotations that readers have sent in. Our reproduction of comments is not a stamp of approval from _The Indexer_ upon the reviewer’s assessment of an index. Extracts are arranged alphabetically under the names of publishers, within the sections: Indexes praised; Two cheers!; Indexes censured; Indexes omitted.

## Indexes praised

**Boydell & Brewer**: _The sacred space of the Virgin Mary in medieval Hispanic literature: from Gonzalo de Berceo to Ambrosio Montesino_, by Lesley K. Twomey (2019, xii + 484 pp, £70). Rev. by Mary Jane Kelley, _Medieval Review_, 2 April 2020.

_The Sacred Space of the Virgin Mary in Medieval Hispanic Literature_ will be of most use as a research tool for scholars studying medieval Marian literature. The index guides the reader directly to specific examples of metaphors, images, and figurae of the Virgin, and the comparative discussion of those examples illustrates the subtle differences and rich ensemble. So, for example, consulting Twomey’s index for metaphors of the Virgin as fountain or font yields 64 entries, which undoubtedly cover the spectrum of possible implications. The footnotes and bibliography point scholars towards additional reading.

**Cambridge University Press**: _Mary Wollstonecraft in context_, ed. by Nancy E. Johnson and Paul Keen (2020, 390 pp, £85, US$110).

**Routledge**: _The Wollstonecraftian mind_, ed. by Sandrine Bergès, Eileen Hunt Botting and Alan Coffee (2019, 512 pp, £190). Rev. by E. J. Clery, _Times Literary Supplement_, 8 May 2020.

While each contains the same number of articles, the entries in the handsome Cambridge volume are brisk and instructional, and those in the Routledge compendium tend more to argument and speculation, giving readers the chance to explore unexpected byways, aided by a superb index.

**Four Corners Books**: _Greetings from the barricades: revolutionary postcards in Imperial Russia_, by Tobie Mathew (2018, 479 pp, £20). Rev. by Donald Rayfield, _Literary Review_, December 2018.

Tobie Mathew’s magnificent book testifies to Russia’s unrepeatable two years of free-ranging political satire. The book has been magnificently produced and professionally edited. It is very generously illustrated, with excellent notes and index. The narrative is a little disorganised, neither wholly chronological nor thematic, but everything one might want to know can be found in it.

**Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies (PIMS)**: _The arts of editing medieval Greek and Latin: a casebook_. Studies and Texts 203, ed. by Elisabet Göransson (2016, 452 pp, £58.41). Rev. by Scott G. Bruce, _Medieval Review_, 19 June 2016.

As a ‘case book’ of innovative editorial practices, this volume is not intended to be read from cover to cover. In light of this, the editors have done a magnificent job of indexing the individual articles to facilitate their use by scholars who dip into the collection to find solutions to their own editing issues. Each contribution begins with a series of helpful summaries under the following categories: type of text and textual material considered in the article; the date of the sources, both their origin and the manuscripts that provide evidence of their later use; specific witnesses used in the case study; the methodological problem considered in the contribution; the solution imposed by the author; and cross-referencing to other articles in the book dealing with similar problems. In addition, there is a useful glossary of technical editorial terms at the end of the book alongside a general index and an index of the manuscripts cited by the authors.

**Oxford University Press**: _The interpretation of dreams_, by Artemidorus, ed. by Peter Thonemann and Martin Hammond (2020, 416 pp, £10.99). Rev. by Edith Hall, _Times Literary Supplement_, 12 June 2020.

The lively introduction and explanatory notes by Peter Thonemann, the judiciously selected suggestions for reading, and above all the sub-divisions of longer sections and the marvellously useful index, make Artemidorus accessible to lay readers and even casual browsers.

**Pennsylvania State University Press**: _Picatrix: A medieval treatise on astral magic_. Magic in history, tr. by Dan Attrell and David Porreca (2019, xii + 361 pp). Rev. by Michael Bailey, _Medieval Review_, 12 September 2019.

Many readers will no doubt want to dip into this long treatise, looking for points that interest them. In this, they will be enormously aided by Attrell and Porreca’s several excellent and detailed indices, the longest of which, on ‘Subjects and Materials,’ runs to over fifty pages. An index is such an easy target for a press looking for some cost-saving concision that Penn State deserves praise for giving Attrell and Porreca the necessary space.

## Two cheers!

**University of Delaware Press**: _Later Middle English literature, materiality, and culture: essays in honor of James M. Dean_, ed. by Brian Gastle and Erick Kelemann (2018, xix + 248 pp, £80). Rev. by Hannah Ryley, _Medieval Review_, 3 January 2020.

The endmatter is largely accurate and well edited. The bibliography is formatted well; spot checks did not identify anything to be missing. However, there are some small errors and oddities. For example, Mary Shelley, spelled accurately everywhere else, becomes ‘Shelley, Mary Wolestonecraft’ \[sic\] in the index. Again in the index, it was perhaps gratuitous to list exhaustively by name Justin Bieber, Edmund Muskie, and Barack Obama (all of whom have publicly cried), but not to include anywhere ‘tears’ or even ‘medieval tears,’ the somatic behaviour that is the point of Amsler’s argument (10). The index is otherwise judicious in scope and follows typical, useful conventions.

## Indexes censured

**Forgotten Books**: _King René d’Anjou and his seven queens_, by Edgcumbe Staley (classic reprint 2018 (first published 1913), 470 pp, £21.95/£3). Rev. by Edith Sichel, _Times Literary Supplement_, 3 July 2020.

None of Mr Staley’s dramatis personae show any study of character below the surface, but a glance at his bibliography will, at least in part, account for this inadequacy; and a glance at his index will bring fresh evidence of his faulty equipment. ‘Erotic ascendency,’ and ‘Volte-face, a,’ seem rather vague entries, and hardly compensate for the omission of the name of Van Eyck, who taught René to paint.

**Headline**: _Dave Brubeck: a life in time_, by Philip Clark (2020, 464 pp, £25). Rev. by Russell Davies, _Times Literary Supplement_, 14 August 2020.

Incidentally, ‘Rogers’ for ‘Rodgers’, is not the only slip of its kind: we also have the artist Edward Hooper, even in the index; arrangements by Herb Pomery, for Pomeroy; and difficult topics ‘poured over’ more than once.

**Oxford University Press**: _The House of Lords and the Labour government_, by Janet Morgan (1975, 268 pp, £5.20). Rev. by Richard Davenport-Hines, Letters, _Times Literary Supplement_, 19 September 1975.

I endorse Sir Henry D’Avigdor-Goldsmid’s praise of Janet Morgan’s excellent study, _The House of Lords and the Labour Government_ (September 5), but regret that he elides criticism of its publisher, the Oxford University Press, who have printed an index which is inexcusably slipshod even by their usual lax standards.

In a casual reading of the initial 165 pages of the book, I noted seventy-five peers who are mentioned or quoted in the text, but ignored in the index; I don’t doubt that a systematic count would yield scores more. There is less sense in publishing a study signally concerned with the influence of personality on policy, but saddled with such a lousy index, than in measuring the distance from London Bridge to one o’clock. The Clarendon Press should be censured for their disservice to Dr Morgan and her readers.

## Indexes omitted

**Boydell & Brewer**: _The cartulary and charters of the Priory of Saints Peter and Paul, Ipswich: Part I: The cartulary_. Suffolk Charters, ed. by David Allen (2018, xix + 292 pp, £60). Rev. by Fraser McNair, _Medieval Review_, 13 June 2020.

It is something of a shame that this book does not contain an index, particularly a chronological index. Indexes for both this volume and the follow-up volume on the priory’s original charters are slated to come out in volume two, and it does seem reasonable to suppose that most researchers interested in the topic will try and get their hands on both; nonetheless, splitting the indexes up might have facilitated easier use of the volume, even if it occasioned some repetition.

## By the way …

### Half mad

I am half mad at the moment from working on the index to my latest page-turner, which I have to prepare by myself. On this account my words are lame, as Job put it (who appears to have undergone something similar).

Gerschom Scholem, in _Correspondence: 1939–1969_, by Theodor W. Adorno and Gerschom Scholem, ed. by Asaf Angermann, tr. by Sebastian Truskolaski and Paula Schwebel (Polity Press, 2020). (_The ‘page-turner’ in question was_ Origins of the Kabbalah.)

### The worst index ever

Lastly I am sorry to trouble you, but it is right that you should know that the index-maker has made the worst index, I believe, ever published, notwithstanding that my son & I spent 2 days in correcting it, & this has caused delay. We had to look to fully ⅓ of references to conjecture what reference meant. The miserable work is chiefly due to ignorance of the matter, but not wholly so, for he scamped his work. For instance under names Lynch & De Vries, instead of looking to see what they had written about the general heading on top of page was copied. In no book published by you was there ever so bad an index.

Charles Darwin to his publisher, Robert Francis Cooke, 8 November 1880, from _The correspondence of Charles Darwin_, vol. 28, Cambridge University Press (in press). (Darwin refers to the index for his latest work, _Movement in plants_.)

### Impossible but necessary

In his review of Judith Flanders’s _A Place for Everything_ (May 1), James Waddell mentions in passing ‘searchable library catalogues’. In the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth century (and beyond in some countries) academic library catalogues were arranged not by the alphabet but by the classification systems in use in those libraries. They, of course, required alphabetical indexes to be useful to most library users. The stark fact about any linear (classified, alphabetical, or other) arrangement is that each arrangement destroys all other possible arrangements and must, therefore, be supplemented by an alphabetical index or other tool. S. R. Ranganathan wrote that ‘Knowledge is multi-dimensional and the number of dimensions tends to the infinite’. Reducing those dimensions to A–Z or 1–10 or any other straight line is both a logical impossibility and a practical necessity.

Michael Gorman, Letters, _Times Literary Supplement_, 12 June 2020

### The ring of omniscience

The bureaucracy of Empire was overelaborate … The annual General Index to the Administration of Aden gives us a glimpse of the ruling style. ‘Lady type-writers’ had not yet reached the tropical outstations, and the Index was written in a huge and splendid copperplate hand that suggested Dickensian clerks on high stools, beneath the slowly creaking punkahs of the forenoon. Here are some characteristic entries, not always scrupulously spelt:

> _Compressed Hay_: enquiries regarding the practicability of obtaining from Italy.
> 
> _Engine Driver_: entertainment of an, for the Steam Launch _Rose_.
> 
> _Ewes_: purchase of Abyssinian, for Government Farm at Hyderabad.
> 
> _Exumation_: of the body of M. Boucher, late Commandant of the French gunboat _Etendard_.
> 
> _Fee_: sanction for payment of a, of Rs 200 for a surgical operation performed on a relative of the Abdali Sultan.
> 
> _Mails_: _re_ fumigation of, Aden to Mauritius.
> 
> _Opium_: agents B.I.S.N.Co. petition for a reduction of transhipment fees levied on, to China _via_ Bombay.
> 
> _Pecuniary arrangements_: Government servants prohibited from entertaining into, with members of the department to which they belong in connection with the resignation of appointments held by them.
> 
> _Pilgrims_: copy of an unfinished report by Consul Moncrieff on the alleged ill-treatment of, at Camaran Island.
> 
> _Slave girls_: Home Government requires particulars regarding two, made over to the Good Shepherd Convent.
> 
> There is the ring of omniscience to such a list, written in such a script, in such a huge thick-leaved register of Empire.
> 
> (_Pax Britannica: the climax of an empire_, by James (later Jan) Morris (1968, later edition 2012)

### An oversight

_Phyllis Schlafly_ (played by Cate Blanchett), examining Barry Goldwater’s memoirs, _With no apologies_ (William Morrow, 1979): The index goes from Saxby straight to Schlesinger.

_Fred Schlafly_ (played by John Slattery): that was an oversight.
