## Abstract

The paper examines the development of facet analysis as a methodology and the role it plays in building classifications and other knowledge-organization tools. The use of categorical analysis in areas other than library and information science is also considered. The suitability of the faceted approach for humanities documentation is explored through a critical description of the FATKS (Facet Analytical Theory in Managing Knowledge Structure for Humanities) project carried out at University College London. This research focused on building a conceptual model for the subject of religion together with a relational database and search-and-browse interfaces that would support some degree of automatic classification. The paper concludes with a discussion of the differences between the conceptual model and the vocabulary used to populate it, and how, in the case of religion, the choice of terminology can create an apparent bias in the system.

Facet analysis is now widely agreed to be a reliable methodology for building controlled vocabularies in the form of classifications, thesauri and other subject-retrieval tools, and Hjørland ([2013](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R41): 1) has described it as ‘probably the dominant theory of the late twentieth century’. Originally conceived by S. R. Ranganathan in the 1930s (Ranganathan, [1967](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R57)), it was developed in a particularly British tradition by the Classification Research Group (CRG) ([1955](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R25); [1969](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R26)) in the second half of the twentieth century. A faceted approach can be seen in a number of special schemes created by the CRG, in the second edition of Bliss’s _Bibliographic Classification_ (Mills and Broughton, [1977a](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R48); [1977b](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R49); 1980), and in several large-scale thesauri such as _Art & architecture thesaurus_ (1994) and _Thesaurofacet_ (Aitchison, [1970](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R2)). There has been a resurgence of interest in faceted classification since the year 2000 (Broughton, [2006](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R16)), and it is now seen in many different environments. All the general schemes of library classification presently show a more facet-like structure; the new International Standard ISO 25964 and the British Standard BS 8723 Structured Vocabularies for Information Retrieval, on which it is based, acknowledge facet analysis to be a useful means of constructing a vocabulary, with many examples of faceted structures and arrangements; and the Library of Congress FAST Headings tool provides a faceted, or post-coordinate, version of Library of Congress subject headings. The inherent logic of the faceted system makes it hospitable to machine retrieval and some work has been done on representing faceted structures in web ontology languages (Miles and Bechhofer, [2009](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R47)). There is also a substantial area of application in e-commerce, where faceted search interfaces are now so common as to be almost the norm (Adkisson, [2005](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R1); La Barre, [2006](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R45)).

The basis of the faceted approach is the idea that the concepts in any given subject area, or domain, can be analysed and individually assigned to a selection of theoretical categories, which are predominantly functional or linguistic in nature. The process of analysis generates a conceptual model of the domain, and a logical and systematic structure which is then used as a basis for the organization of documents. In Ranganathan’s philosophy these categories are referred to as fundamental categories, and consist of _personality, energy, matter, space_, and _time_. Within a particular domain the fundamental categories are translated into _facets_ specific to that domain; for example, in zoology, the _personality_ category is represented by the _animals_ or _organisms_ facet, _energy_ by the _physiology_ or _bodily processes_ facet, _parts_ by the _anatomy or organs and systems of the body_ facet, and so on. When classifying or indexing documents, concepts are listed or combined in a predetermined and consistent order of their containing facets, known as citation order, or in Ranganathan’s case, a facet formula.

Because Ranganathan’s categories are relatively few in number, his formulae for individual domains often contain what are termed rounds and levels. For example in Class I, Botany, the facet formula is I \[P\], \[P2\]: E where P (personality) represents different genera and species of plants, and P2 (second-level personality) are the parts and components of plants. This method of using second-level personality to deal with the parts of an entity or system can also be found in History \[P\], \[P2\]: \[E\]: \[T\], and Political science \[P\], \[P2\]: \[E\]. The formulae can become very complex, as in the case of Class J Agriculture J \[P\] \[P2\] \[P3\]: \[E\] \[2P\]: \[2E\], where additional formulae are provided for Soil J \[P\] \[P2\] \[P3\]: \[1\] \[2P\]: \[2E\], Propagation \[P\] \[P2\] \[P3\]: \[3\] \[2P\]: \[2E\], and Disease \[P\] \[P2\] \[P3\]: \[4\] \[2P\]: \[2E\].

In the United Kingdom the CRG elaborated Ranganathan’s theory and identified a larger number of categories, namely _thing, kind, part, property, material, process, operation, agent, patient, product, by-product, space_ and _time_. This enabled more nuanced analysis, and the potential for distinguishing between, for example, _processes_ in plant husbandry (such as fertilization, growth, disease and fruiting), and _operations_ (such as sowing, weeding, harvesting and drying).

## Categorical analysis beyond library science

The deployment of categories as part of an analytical technique is not restricted to library and information science. It is fairly common in various kinds of content-analysis methodologies where text is involved, from about the mid-twentieth century onwards, notable examples being systems theory and grounded theory. The purpose is to build a model of the system or environment under consideration to better understand the various agencies and processes within it, and their interrelationships. The ‘text’ may be the aggregated terminology of the domain, obtained from vocabulary sources such as glossaries, dictionaries or indexing languages, or it may be a corpus of actual texts such as articles, reports, narratives or interview transcripts. Similarly, the nature of the categories is varied: sometimes, as with library and information science, a predetermined set of categories is used; in other situations categories are allowed to ‘emerge’ from the text as the analysis is carried out. Soft-systems theory provides a good example of the former; for example, categories used in the soft-systems analysis of business environments are often represented by the formula CATWOE (clients; actors; transformations; weltanschauung = world view; owner; environmental constraints) originally defined by Checkland ([1989](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R24): 282). Even within information science, and among facet analysts, the choice of categories may be very diverse. Perry and Kent’s Semantic Code (Perry et al., [1956](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R52)) uses _relationships, states, processes, substances_, and _objects_ (although the last three are suggestive of _energy, matter_ and _personality_), and Gardin ([1965](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R37)) identifies _status, property_ and _movement_, among others, in several systems designed for subjects as different as archaeology, mythology and the Quran. Perhaps the most intriguing parallel example of categorical analysis is in Louis Guttman’s ([1959](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R40)) research in social psychology, which he calls facet analysis, and claims to have invented, apparently without any reference to the work of Ranganathan or others in the field of information work. Guttman’s work is essentially mathematical in nature, applied to problems of statistical analysis, and it has been suggested that the link is through Ranganathan’s mathematics background (Beghtol, [1995](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R9)).

## Facet analysis in alphabetical subject cataloguing

While the faceted approach was initially intended as a means of modelling classification systems (because its analytical basis provided a way of handling the complex content of documents in a consistent and therefore predictable manner), quite early in its development it was also seen as relevant to subject cataloguing – that is, document indexing – as well as document organization. Although there is a distinction to be made between a _concept_ and the _term(s)_ that are used to represent it (what Ranganathan calls the _idea plane_ and the _verbal plane_), in practice it is hard to consider one without reference to the other, for a concept cannot be discussed without the use of its associated terms. A concept is often defined as an abstraction, an idea or general notion, whereas a term is a label for that idea, what may be designated a ‘concept name’ (Prasad and Guha, [2008](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R54): 501). The difference is readily demonstrated through the part which natural language plays. The same concept in different natural languages evidently has a variety of labels in, for example, English, German, Spanish or Russian. In a single language rich in synonyms, such as English, there may be many terms for the same concept, and in the case of homonyms, there may be several concepts related to the same term. Overall the association between a concept and its potential labels is very close, and it is easy to see how the same analytical methodology is relevant to both alphabetically and systematically organized systems. As Coates ([1960b](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R28): 16) says of the role of subject cataloguing and classification in representing subject content,

> the two disciplines only diverge at the subsequent phase in which the abstracted idea is reformulated by the subject cataloguer as a subject heading and by the classifier as a classification symbol. Both … provide answers to the question ‘What is the subject of this document?’ which are different in form alone.

The use of categories in subject indexing may be said to precede the work of Ranganathan on classification, since it was employed by Kaiser as early as [1911](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R44) to analyse and organize terms in subject headings in the field of commercial and industrial literature, using three categories: _concrete, place_ and _process_. Kaiser’s systematic indexing was more than a pragmatic solution to complexity of content; it was both semantically and syntactically sophisticated, and well supported by a theoretical rationale (Dousa, [2013](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R32)). His categories are easily interpreted as precursors of Ranganathan’s fundamental categories of _personality, space_ and _energy_. A major contribution of Kaiser’s work is the use of the categories to establish the relative importance of the subject heading terms, and hence the order of combination in the heading – what we now call citation order. For Kaiser, a _concrete_ would take precedence over a _process_, and would always be the entry word. Where a _place_ was involved, there would be two entries, one of the form _concrete, place, process_ (e.g. wine, France, export), and the other _place, concrete, process_ (e.g. France, wine, export).

Other applications of facet theory to subject cataloguing are to be found in the work of Eric Coates, and, significantly, in the development of the British National Bibliography PRECIS indexing system at the British Library (Austin, [1984](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R8)), which arose as a direct result of the CRG work in the 1970s. Coates ([1960b](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R28)) has written what is undoubtedly the authoritative UK study of subject catalogues, and one which employs categories as a means of formulating and ordering entries in the alphabetical subject catalogue. As in Kaiser’s work, Coates uses the categories and their interrelationships as the basis on which the structure of a subject heading and the order of its components are determined, but his thinking is more specifically derived from Ranganathan’s work on catalogue entry (Ranganathan, [1945](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R55); [1951](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R56)). As he says in _Subject catalogues_ (Coates, [1960b](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R28): 44),

> From the practical point of view the order Personality, Matter, Energy, Space, Time is of the utmost importance, for this is the order in which the constituent parts of the Colon classification symbol are cited, and of course, it goes without saying that this order of citation determines where the subject is placed in the classified sequence. In his _Dictionary Catalogue Code_ Ranganathan uses this facet formula as a basis for the construction of compound headings for the dictionary catalogue.

Hence the relationship between the structure of the classmark, which controls the classified sequence, and the form of alphabetical subject entry in the catalogue is a close one, both underpinned by the use of fundamental categories. Writing during the very early days of the CRG, the categories Coates identifies ([1960b](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R28): 57) differ slightly from the standard CRG list, but they correspond closely in their general nature and scope: _thing, material, action, part, property, viewpoint, location._ To some extent they form a bridge, or transitional stage, between Ranganathan’s PMEST and the later CRG set, with the addition of _part_ and _property_, but the retention of the undifferentiated _action_ (for _energy_). As with the rounds and levels of PMEST, it is sometimes necessary to specify _thing A_ and _thing B_, and/or _action A_ and _action B_. An interesting inclusion is that of _viewpoint_, which otherwise has only occurred in Otlet and LaFontaine’s Universal Decimal Classification ([1905–7](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R51)), where it is a generally applicable auxiliary table.

The use of facet analysis not only for the construction of classification schemes but also for alphabetical subject indexing, and slightly later as a basis for thesaurus construction (Aitchison, [1986](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R3)), confirms it as a more general theory and methodology underpinning subject knowledge organization systems than might originally have been considered (Broughton, [2006](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R16)). Much of the emphasis on the careful analysis of concepts, and the identification of relationships between them, carries right through to digital tools and to ontology engineering.

## Facet analysis in different disciplinary fields

Most of the original work of the CRG focused on scientific and technical subjects, and both the theory and the methodology are particularly well suited to the scientific domain. Much less attention has been paid to facet analysis in the humanities, although there are some especially interesting problems centred around the vocabulary of arts and humanities disciplines. These include the relationships between concepts in the classification and their lexical labels in the terminology per se, and the way in which equivalence can be determined in cross- and multicultural contexts. In Europe, twentieth-century research into categorical analysis paid more attention to the humanities, particularly in France, as documented by de Grolier ([1962](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R31): 61–89). Significant work included that of Gardin ([1965](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R37)), initially for archaeology and later for iconography, and his conceptual analysis of texts such as the ‘Mesopotamian tablets, the Koran, mythical tales (and more especially the myths of the Pueblo Indians)’ (de Grolier, [1962](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R31): 84). A notable exception to the scientific focus of the original CRG work is Eric Coates’s classification for the British Catalogue of Music ([1960a](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R27)), one of the earliest UK faceted schemes and the only example from a CRG member to feature a traditional humanities subject. However, like archaeology, music contains a substantial technical vocabulary, and it was this, perhaps, that made it more amenable to facet analysis.

## Facet Analytical Theory in Managing Knowledge Structure for Humanities (FATKS)

The FATKS (Facet Analytical Theory in Managing Knowledge Structure for Humanities) project at University College London (UCL) ([https://www.ucl.ac.uk/fatks/](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/fatks/)) examined the theory and methodology involved in building a faceted classification intended for use as a tool for browsing and retrieval of humanities resources in an online environment (Broughton and Slavic, [2007](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R23)). The concept behind the work was the belief that certain features of a faceted system, which were particularly useful in supporting browsing and search in a subject context, were transferable to an online environment and could have distinct advantages in handling digital resources.

The work was occasioned in the first instance by the proposed merger of the two JISC (Joint Information Systems Committee)-funded portals which at the time dealt with humanities resources in the UK: the Arts and Humanities Data Service (AHDS), which consisted of five independently managed data services, and the Humbul Humanities Hub (Broughton, [2002a](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R13); [2002c](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R15)). The millions of items held by AHDS were of very varied format and complex subject content; images were a significant element, but there were also sound recordings, film and video, animation, and multimedia resources, as well as etexts. As a consequence a major problem for the service was the difficulty of cross-collection searching.

Resources within the two portals were manually catalogued using Dublin Core, developed and managed by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI), and the de facto standard for digital resource cataloguing. Dublin Core, however, like other cataloguing standards, has no recommended authority for subject metadata, and so within the portals several different vocabularies were being used. At the time of the research, any attempt at integrated search had been abandoned in favour of separate searching of the individual data services, even though this meant that searchers failed to retrieve much of the relevant material (Broughton and Slavic, [2007](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R23): 728). It was felt that a single system would be more appropriate for the merged service, and ideally one which would offer more effective cross-collection searching and retrieval.

By the year 2000 the potential for faceted approaches to information retrieval in managed electronic environments had already been established (Broughton [2001](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R12); Duncan, [1989](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R33); Gödert, [1987](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R38); [1991](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R39); Ingwersen and Wormell, [1992](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R42)). Work on the faceted approach in the 1990s saw the development of applications such as ‘view-based’ and ‘facet space’ systems that, within a Windows environment, allowed the simultaneous display of multiple facets using cascaded menus and interactive windows as an aid to search formulation and retrieval (Allen, [1995a](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R5); [1995b](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R6); Pollitt et al., [1996](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R53)). The discussion had also begun with respect to the unmanaged world of the Internet (Broughton and Lane, [2000](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R20); [2004](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R21); Ellis and Vasconcelos, [1999](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R34); [2000](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R35)).

Some of the perceived advantages of a faceted scheme over conventional classifications included:

•

a scheme’s logic and predictability and the regularity of the structure

•

the capacity for representing the subjects of semantically complex resources through combination of concepts

•

clear rules (system syntax) for that combination

•

flexibility in combination that allows for multiple paths to resource discovery and retrieval.

All of the above also enhance a system’s suitability for use in a digital context, especially in terms of machine comprehension and manipulation of the system, and the possibility of some automatic processing of the materials for subject cataloguing and indexing. Although it was not at that time a particular concern, as the World Wide Web expanded it became clear that large-scale human cataloguing of online resources was not a viable proposition, and research in the following years was also concerned with automatic metadata generation as an alternative.

### Building the FATKS prototype classification

The immediate task was to build the prototype classification and to test its effectiveness as a classification and indexing tool. The prototype named FAT-HUM consisted of three distinct semantic components. First, two disciplines, religion and the fine arts, were chosen as examples of humanities disciplines, partly because of recent work on their facet structure. The vocabularies for these fields would be developed in some detail and used as a test bed for the classification work. Second, to provide for any broader subject coverage that might be required, they were located within the framework of the Broad System of Ordering (BSO) ([https://www.ucl.ac.uk/fatks/bso/about.htm](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/fatks/bso/about.htm)), a general knowledge organization structure containing about 6,800 concepts. BSO had originally been developed by Eric Coates in [1978](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R30) as a general search and tagging tool and a switching language specifically for wide-scale environments, such as international affiliations of libraries and documentation centres. Finally, frequently occurring concepts such as place, form and ethnicity were catered for by the use of the auxiliary tables of the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC), themselves also subject to recent revision (Broughton, [1998](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R10); [2002b](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R14)) as part of a general project to improve the facet structure of UDC (McIlwaine and Williamson, [1994](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R46)). All of these elements assumed a faceted approach as the natural underlying principle of their construction, and together represented a coherent interlocking structure, as shown in [Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#F1).

Of the core constituents the principal demonstrator was the religion vocabulary. This work built on the recent revisions of religion in the _Bibliographic Classification second edition_ (BC2) and the UDC. In both of those cases one major objective of the exercise was to alleviate the bias towards Christianity shown by most Western classification schemes through a more equitable provision of notation and detail in the vocabulary. The treatment of religion in major classifications had long been the subject of complaint from librarians, with Dewey usually regarded as the worst offender (Zins and Santos, [2011](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R60): 881). The revision of Class P of Bliss’s _Bibliographic Classification_ (Mills and Broughton, [1977b](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R49)), and of Class 2 of the UDC (Broughton, [2000](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R11)), by applying a faceted approach to the terminology of religion, created classifications in which all of the major religions were regarded as equal from a classificatory perspective. A further consequence was the use of a generic template for subdivision, and the provision of a standard pattern for the detail under each faith.

The FAT-HUM vocabularies for religion adopted this general methodology, but benefited considerably from the experience gained with BC2 and UDC. They were more cleanly and systematically structured than the original BC2 schedules, being influenced greatly by the underlying database structure of the UDC, which brought to the fore some of the constraints imposed by machine management of the terminology (Slavic and Cordeiro, [2002](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R58); [2004](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R59)). The development of the schedules for individual religions in UDC was also a work in progress and our thinking had similarly progressed alongside the revision work.

The concepts in religion were initially divided into ten groups, using the standard CRG-type categories which had been employed in the revision of BC2 and subsequently in UDC. Other work, especially in the fine and creative arts, suggests that additional categories are needed to fit the somewhat different conceptual structure of these fields; for example, _form, style_ and _genre_ are usually necessary for the organization of material in disciplines which are imaginative or representational. Nevertheless, despite their non-scientific nature, the religion concepts were found to map to the categories reasonably well ([Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#F2)). Some imagination was needed to interpret some of the more abstract concepts, such as ‘schism’ or ‘mission’, but this was only on a par with other subjects, and seemed to be more related to the understanding of the categories than to differences in disciplinary approach.

What might be termed a ‘pseudo-category’, _theory and philosophy_, was added, as is common in CRG-type faceted schemes, although these highly abstract terms might as easily have been accommodated within _properties_ which they mostly consist of. Ultimately, in the UDC revision of religion, an additional facet of _evidences_ was inserted to contain concepts such as sacred texts and other foundational reasons for belief. This was the only non-standard category, but it is close in nature to _agents_, which it sits next to in the sequence, and it might have been regarded as a subset of that category as it is in this prototype. This process of analysis demonstrates quite nicely that the method is an art rather than a science, particularly when it comes to concepts with more fluid meanings. The standard categories were completed by space and time, which in the FAT-HUM case were derived from the UDC auxiliary tables for those concepts.

Within a facet the vocabulary is further organized into _arrays_ or _sub-facets_ of terms which share a particular _characteristic_ or _principle of division_. It is often the case that the defining characteristic or principle is derived from elsewhere in the vocabulary, as in [Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#F3).

At this stage equivalence relationships are acknowledged by bringing together synonyms or near-synonyms at the same location. As a final element in the structure, hierarchical relationships are identified. This is normally a straightforward process in faceted scheme construction, since the concepts within a facet are all of the same categorical nature, and the only possible relationships between them are those of hierarchy, either subordination, superordination or coordination. The conventions of classification are that these hierarchical relationships are shown in the visual display by indentation ([Figure 4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#F4)).

In all knowledge organization systems a primary means of making structure, status and relationships evident is the use of mark-up or encoding. In a classification scheme a system of encoding is already in place, namely the notation; this has the immediate function of identifying the individual concept or class, and maintaining the linear order or sequence, but other relationships and properties can be displayed through the judicious use of the notation. Notation used in the source vocabularies was quite diverse, and not necessarily aligned with the project objectives. Broughton and Slavic ([2007](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R23): 736–7) note,

> In BC2, from which the domain vocabularies were drawn, the notation is of a relatively unusual type, being ordinal, non-expressive, and retroactive in terms of synthesis, automatically imposing citation order if the rules for classmark building are carefully followed. While this provides an easy, elegant, and painless way to maintain order in the linear environment of the library shelf, it is not helpful for machine management. The UDC notation, which is expressive of hierarchy and uses a large number of symbols as facet indicators, was a better model for a notation for the prototype. It was decided that the notation for each concept would clearly indicate the subject area to which it belongs, the facet it comes from (facet indicator), and its hierarchical position within the facet.

Consequently a completely fresh system of notational coding was devised which incorporated all of these features ([Figure 5](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#F5)).

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2020.25/asset/9b2007a3-14f7-4845-a9f0-3482c942f74b/assets/graphic/indexer_2020_25_fig5.jpg)

Figure 5. Notational coding in FAT-HUM classification

[Open in viewer](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#F5)

In this example the notation ‘590’ indicates the broad subject class (i.e. religion) within the total structure; ‘J’ denotes the facet status of the concept (i.e. religious activities, _operations_); and the following number relates to the individual concept or class, and its position within the linear sequence and within the hierarchy. So 590 J 14247 ‘Abstinence. Fasting’ is shown to be following ‘Dietary requirements’ and preceding ‘Rules concerning specific foods’, and also to be three levels of hierarchy down from 590 J 14 ‘Social behaviour’. From these data it is possible to infer the broader term (or containing class) and any narrower terms (or subordinate classes). Although this feature of coding was not exploited in the FATKS project, it was subsequently used in the BC2 work to automatically generate a thesaurus format from the encoded data for the classification structure (Aitchison, [2004](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R4); Broughton, [2008](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R17)).

The notation was also central to the representation of complex subject content, since it supported combination in a manner in which the various constituents of the complex subject remain evident.

In [Figure 6](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#F6) the concept of the Holy has been taken from the general facet of philosophy and added to specific named religions. Complicated notations can be built up when facets are combined from the core humanities vocabularies with auxiliary table concepts ([Figure 7](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#F7)).

Hence in the prototype tool the notation works together with the internal rules of the system, or system syntax, to support the internal conceptual structure. The notation also bears the burden of synthesis of compound classmarks through the imposition of citation order based on facet status.

The second stage of the project was to build a relational database to hold the classification data and act as an editorial tool for the management of the prototype classification by its owners; this also involved the major task of populating it with the data.

The third element was to facilitate access to the data through the development of a search interface for end users ([Figure 8](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#F8)). In addition to simply acting as a repository, the database was therefore also able to support a facet search and browsing function that included, for example, the facility to expand and collapse hierarchies. Because of the way in which the notation was representative of the internal conceptual structure of the system, the prototype was able to manage combinations of concepts, applying citation order of elements in line with the system syntax and building valid classmarks; used in this way it could potentially enable computer-assisted indexing. Strictly speaking, notation so employed can support a considerable level of automatic indexing, searching (through query formulation and modification) and retrieval without being evident to the end user; hence it is a viable means of supporting discovery in a more intuitive style without the end user needing to learn or understand the syntactic rules.

The development of the prototype classification demonstrated the feasibility of building a system that translates the conceptual approach of facet analysis into a manageable data structure that can support all the semantic and syntactic features of a fully faceted vocabulary.

At the end of the project it was felt that three important objectives had been achieved:

•

The validity of facet analysis for humanities work had been demonstrated in the creation of the conceptual model.

•

This was reflected in the structure of the relational database built as an editorial tool to hold the classification data. The complexity of the conceptual model could be replicated there, as could the system syntax.

•

The search-and-browse interface provided a verbal means of access to the content of the prototype.

The second and third objectives together formed a basis for potential non-human classification of resources in religion, an important issue as unmanaged information continues to grow at an unprecedented rate.

The prototype performed well, but our emphasis then was predominantly on the mechanics of the exercise and the usability of the methodology rather than the intellectual analysis of the domain vocabulary as such. Synthesis of classmarks for complex subjects was seen to work effectively, the subjects were fully represented and the notation complied with the system rules. However, the whole was subject to a lack of clarity in the semantics of the built notations.

## Representing complex content through structure and terminology

The matter of factoring (now referred to as splitting) has long been a concern in the verbal-indexing world. Standards for thesaurus construction routinely address the question of how one should represent a concept that is either syntactically or semantically composite. There are numerous examples provided in the literature and in the standards themselves, but those below serve to illustrate the problem. Syntactic factoring, or splitting, is considered where the entry terms, or concepts, consist of multiple words in a phrase, e.g.

Various rules and conventions apply to whether a term such as ‘horse racing’ is a valid entry term, or if it should be created post-coordinately – that is, at the time of search – from the two simple terms ‘horse’ and ‘racing’. In such a case the term ‘horse racing’ would not feature in the indexing language, nor would it be used in a heading or as a descriptor. Exceptions to this rule include where the term is a well-established one (information retrieval), where the compound has a meaning beyond its constituents (Mothering Sunday), or where the constituents standing alone have a different meaning to that in the compound (blue movies, cats’ eyes).

Semantic factoring is more complicated, and is now not routinely covered in the standards. Nevertheless, it is a concern for compilers of knowledge organization systems, since it involves a key relationship between a concept and the lexical labels used to describe it. Semantic factoring refers to a situation which is the inverse of syntactic factoring, and where a compound concept is represented by a single term. For example, the term ‘gingivitis’ means ‘inflammation (of the) gums’, but neither of its semantic components are identifiable in the term itself. In a thesaurus the term ‘gingivitis’ would be included, but in a faceted classification it might very well not be, on the assumption that the cataloguer or classifier would understand its meaning, and create a classmark as needed based on the notation for these two elements.

One of the original perceived advantages of faceted classifications was the economy in scheduling since there was no need for the constant repetition of concepts in pre-coordinated class names. Published volumes of these early schemes (including the Colon Classification itself) were invariably slim, providing only the key concepts in the relevant domain. These represented a kind of conceptual skeleton which would become populated only in the classified catalogue or on the shelves as examples of combination of concepts were added as a result of cataloguing documents. The consequence was that the classification itself, while it was conceptually sound, lacked many terms of a semantically compound nature. This severely compromised the classification from a search perspective, since it failed to include large numbers of what would be sought terms. The revision of BC2 resolved the difficulty by expanding the schedules to include pre-synthesized classmarks (what UDC would label ‘examples of combination’) built according to the system rules. This practice had several objectives: to ensure that sought terms were represented in the vocabulary; as a corollary to ensure their appearance in the alphabetical index to the schedules; and to provide the cataloguer with examples of correct application of the rules for combination. Incidentally, the Dewey Decimal Classification also follows this latter custom, but with the primary purpose of demonstrating number building rather than to facilitate the display of these semantic compounds.

The example in [Figure 9](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#F9), from Bliss Class H, Health Sciences (Mills and Broughton, [1980](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R50): 229) shows how this translates into the classification display (note that not every class is included).

![](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/cms/10.3828/indexer.2020.25/asset/95553f1a-fad1-4d51-a003-80e439d9a290/assets/graphic/indexer_2020_25_fig9.jpg)

Figure 9. Schedule expansion in BC2 Health sciences

Without the expansion of the schedule to include these pre-built classes, terms such as ‘scintigraphy’, ‘hepatomegaly’, ‘hepatitis’ and ‘cirrhosis’ would not feature in the system, and would not be easily discoverable by its users.

## The role of terminology in the religion classification

Although such a large technical vocabulary is not common to all disciplines, it does seem that where there is a cultural dimension to the discipline, as is the case with humanities fields, a similar phenomenon could be observed, and this is certainly true of religion. But in focusing on the structural and technical aspects of the FATKS prototype, we had not been able to consider the semantic problems of the terminology. Ongoing revision work on UDC had begun to grapple with this, and the development of the Religion schedules in that scheme had provided some customized expansions for individual faiths, which used the specific vocabulary of the faith to label the classes, rather than a generic name. A generic, or neutral, special auxiliary was provided which could be combined with any faith to create a faith-specific classification; a number of these were created editorially and published as special expansions into which were imported the terms associated with concepts in that particular belief system. This achieved the same aims as the BC2 medicine class, namely making a much larger and more ‘technical’ vocabulary visible and accessible.

<table><tbody><tr><td>2–144.2</td><td>Names of god(s)</td></tr><tr><td>2–23</td><td>Sacred books. Scriptures. Religious texts</td></tr><tr><td>2–24</td><td>Specific texts. Named texts and books</td></tr><tr><td>2–282.5</td><td>Prayer books. Books of prayers</td></tr><tr><td>2–442.45</td><td>Dietary requirements.

There are several interesting features of this phenomenon. First, the presence of a natural-language dimension to the vocabulary means that each primary facet may have very many unique terms associated with it. Second, while these may be broadly equivalent between one faith and another, it is likely that because of cultural differences they do not map exactly to the generic concept used as the basis of combination. An understanding of prayer in Judaism may be very different from that in Buddhism, whereas the nature and composition of an oxygen atom in sulphur dioxide is not different from that in nitrogen dioxide, nor does it have a different name. Clearly in the case of specific named religious entities there is an inevitable mismatch. For example:

Judaism + sacred text = Hebrew Bible

Hinduism + sacred text = Vedas

where Bible and Vedas are conceptually comparable, but not conceptually, or linguistically, equivalent. One can well argue that, in the same discipline, the nature of God in Buddhism is very different from the nature of God in Islam, just as, more obviously, practices and rites are different. For retrieval purposes it is possible that these differences do not matter very much, and that it is useful for the benefit of the data structure that they be regarded as equivalent, since that rationalizes the data structure. Using the same notational coding enables cross-searching to retrieve material that is comparable in function if theologically distinct: for example, all scriptures, or all marriage rites.

### Terminology and religious bias

One advantage of the customized classifications, which had not been fully appreciated until more recently, is the way in which they resolved some of the problems of perceived bias in classification schemes. While a faceted classification should in principle provide an even-handed and unbiased model for knowledge organization in culturally diverse fields, the choice of vocabulary within the classification is also a significant factor in avoiding cultural bias. Even where there is equal notational provision, and a uniform pattern of classification for every culture, bias may still be implicit in the choice of terms and the unconscious dominance they reflect.

The precise use of language in culturally sensitive domains has the power not only to misrepresent, but also to disadvantage and to offend. In the last few years there has been much research into the way in which minority groups have been marginalized through the use or misuse of language. Communities which have been affected in this way include those characterized by gender, race, sexual orientation and political status, although surprisingly there has been little published about apparent discrimination on the grounds of religious belief, despite widespread complaints about Christian dominance in the large library classification schemes. It is clear that very often the bias occurs in the choice of language as much as in the structure of the scheme and the disposition of the notation, and it is important to have this in mind when constructing knowledge-organization systems. A study of religious terms used in some large vocabularies adopted by automatic indexing tools (Broughton, [2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R19)) shows some very regrettable choices, with at best a strong leaning towards the terminology of Christianity, and at worst some archaic expressions displaying an arrogance towards non-Christian faiths, such as ‘Hindoo’ or ‘Mohammedanism’. [Figure 10](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#F10) shows some examples of entry terms in WordNet which are common to most religions but which are associated with strongly Christian language; while the concepts are essentially neutral, the accompanying text is not.

Some recent work (Broughton and Lomas, [2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R22)) has also looked more closely at the nature of religious vocabulary and how the selection of terms can create, or alleviate, bias in the representation of communities in a spectrum of information sectors. While Broughton ([2019](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R19)) had examined the situation in artificial-intelligence applications, Broughton and Lomas ([2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.25#core-R22)) analysed practice in both the library and archival domains. Broughton and Lomas’s work shows that there is a correspondence between the language used in a knowledge-organization system and the standard model of interreligious attitudes. A scheme which has minimal provision for religions as a whole, and a very limited number of terms that are not Christian in origin, may be regarded as exclusivist in its view of the value of different faiths, whereas another that has more equitable treatment with a fuller vocabulary indicative of a variety of religions is inclusivist in approach. A classification scheme that apparently treats all the religions equally with equivalent allocation of notation and a rich mixture of terms and concepts from the whole spectrum of world faiths may be said to be pluralist. A pluralist view should be regarded as desirable in a modern knowledge-organization system intended for use internationally, which may be considered a given in a digital environment. Looking at progression towards the goal of pluralism it is seen that both bibliographic and archival practices are moving towards this position.

## Conclusion

Facet analysis is a sound and reliable methodology for constructing classification schemes and knowledge-organization tools of all kinds. It has been shown over time to provide a strong theoretical basis that is transferable to a wide range of disciplines, and that all these domains are susceptible to analysis, including those in the humanities. The FATKS project demonstrated how a well-constructed prototype can accommodate both manual subject cataloguing and some degree of automatic indexing of resources in religion. However, most of the work in the FATKS exercise was concerned with the data structure of the classification, and with equalizing the conceptual framework for a variety of religions so that a balanced view was presented. Subsequently it was seen that the choice of terminology was as important as the conceptual structure in fairly representing subjects where there is considerable cultural variation in one or more facets.

In a world of increasing diversity it is important that these concerns are acknowledged when building organization and retrieval tools, and that our theory is used to best purpose in dealing with them.
