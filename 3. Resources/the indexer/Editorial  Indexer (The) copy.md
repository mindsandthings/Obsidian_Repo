Publication: The Indexer: The International Journal of Indexing

Volume 40, Number 1

We take you on a journey through the history of indexes in this issue. First stop is with tour guide Michele Combs, who has drawn from multiple sources to illustrate how the book index is not just an object and a tool but also an explosive device that gives the reader freedom to follow their own path.

Ann Kingdom then takes us on a side trip down the tangled and overgrown track that is the history of the index to _The Indexer._ Ann’s article was inspired by discussions about whether or how to continue work on the subject index to the journal, which was last updated in 2010.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.1#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> We plan to follow it up with articles on the art of journal indexing and an exploration of how readers access the content of back issues of the journal using all of the finding aids currently available.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2022.1#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> Our aim is to consider whether to maintain an index to _The Indexer_ and, if so, how to use best practice in journal indexing to produce and maintain an index that will make us all proud. Kudos to Ann for getting us started on this journey. It was not an easy task to walk back through this history, but she has done it well and provided us with a clearer view of how to move forward.

Like several other articles in this issue, Michele Combs’s history of indexes is based on a presentation at an indexing society conference. Deon Schutte reports on indexes in the educational publishing industry in South Africa, Max McMaster shares his experience with quoting on book indexing work, and Pilar Wyman and Judi Gibbs describe their work on the recently updated _ANSI/NISO Z39.4-2021 Criteria for Indexes._ If you attended an indexing society conference this year, these topics may look familiar, but I encourage you to have a look at the articles. We encourage authors to expand on or explain their presentations when writing them up and to think beyond the audience at the conference to an international audience of journal readers. Written versions of these presentations are also a valuable addition to the treasure trove of indexing knowledge and history that is contained in _The Indexer._ With over 60 years of content in over 150 issues, it is an amazing resource, but one that should also be continually added to as indexing practices, tools and guidelines evolve (and all the more reason why we need to carefully consider how to find content in the back issues!). If you were not able to attend these conferences, we hope that publishing these articles will give you an opportunity to tap into what indexers are talking about around the world. On that note, you will also find reports on the Society of Indexers conference and the virtual meetings held by the International Committee of Representatives of Indexing Societies (ICRIS), and a round-up of indexing awards presented in 2021.

We finish our historical jaunt with Hazel Bell’s reflections on _The Indexer_ 40 years ago (April 1982). As Hazel notes, in 1982 _The Indexer_ was already supporting links between indexing societies around the world. Looking back at this history makes me realize how far we have come since then and how important those links still are. The next ICRIS Triennial Meeting and International Indexing Conference is coming up in October 2022, hosted jointly by the Society of Indexers (SI), Deutsches Netzwerk der Indexer (DNI) and Nederlands Indexers Netwerk (NIN). See the advertisement at the end of this issue for more details, and I hope to see you there!
