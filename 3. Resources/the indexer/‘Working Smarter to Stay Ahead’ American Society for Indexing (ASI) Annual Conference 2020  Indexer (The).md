## Abstract

Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the American Society for Indexing (ASI) annual conference scheduled for April 2020 switched to an online venue. The conference had 80 attendees overall, hailing from the United States, Canada, England, Scotland, the Netherlands, Germany, France, and India. Shannon Li reports on the program and reflects on the experience of meeting online with other indexers around the world rather than in the usual in-person conference format.

Indexers were presented with a unique opportunity to attend the annual conference of the American Society for Indexing (ASI) virtually this year. The switch to an online venue was necessitated by the rapid spread of COVID-19, which impeded travel and large gatherings. The conference initially had been scheduled for late April in Raleigh, North Carolina, but the ASI board made the difficult decision in March to postpone. In an effort still to provide members with a valuable educational experience, a one-day virtual conference (using the Zoom platform) was scheduled for Saturday, 2 May. Kendra Millis, the conference committee chairperson – along with the help of ASI president Jennifer Spanier and executive director Gwen Henson – did exceptional work putting together a quality program under such a time constraint.

The program consisted of six 50-minute presentations, with Gwen acting as the moderator, fielding questions from the chat box. JoAnne Burek kicked things off with her talk ‘Stand-out self-promotion: four steps to winning more work before you start chasing clients’. She provided useful tips on setting up an effective directory profile and website, as well as advice on how to stand out in email communication with prospective clients. Diana Witt presented ‘New time management techniques for the savvy indexer’. As the title indicates, she provided advice on maximizing time spent on actual indexing work, pointing out that some time will inevitably have to be carved out for non-indexing tasks, such as bookkeeping, writing emails, and filling out forms on publisher and university portal systems. Fred Leise took the lead role in this year’s installment of the ever-popular ‘Naked indexer’. The concept was started in 2009 by Fred himself, fueled by a desire to see what the indexing process actually looks like apart from written theory. Fred selected a scholarly monograph, and, starting from the beginning of the book, he walked through his thought process of getting a handle on the main topics to anticipate. Skipping ahead to the book’s fourth chapter, he made his way through about ten pages of text, and his live demonstration prompted much fascinating discussion.

The second half of the conference resumed after a 30-minute lunch break. Bonnie Taylor presented ‘Tables of cases’, giving a great explanation of the basics and ‘how-to’s related to tables of cases and statutes in the field of legal indexing. Anne Fifer followed with her presentation ‘Before you say yes (or no)’. She advised resisting the temptation to immediately accept any and every project that comes along, and instead to carefully evaluate certain aspects, such as the book’s length and density, familiarity with the book’s topic, and client expectations on deadline and index size. The final presentation was given by Gale Rhoades on macros. She provided a useful walkthrough of how to record/create macros in Word and in the three major indexing software programs (Cindex, Macrex, Sky), as well as how to use Margaret Berson’s Megabit Macros. Gale’s key point was that utilizing macros effectively is essential for profitability.

While a virtual conference could never fully replicate the experience of an in-person conference, ASI’s program was still a great success overall. The presentations were engaging and informative, and I walked away with several useful tips that I’ll certainly be implementing in my approach to indexing and the business thereof. The ten-minute breaks between presentations – with designated hosts to get the conversations started – were a great way to enjoy some down time and see friendly faces. The Zoom platform worked quite well, and there were only a couple of minor technology issues, such as poor bandwidth. Certainly a major advantage to a virtual setting is the greater capacity for international participation. The conference had about 80 attendees overall, hailing from the United States, Canada, England, Scotland, the Netherlands, Germany, France, and India. Some attendees were particularly grateful for the virtual setting, as personal circumstances had always prevented them from traveling to past in-person conferences. With a successful virtual conference now under its belt, ASI now has the exciting opportunity to consider adding more virtual learning options to its annual programming.

In addition to the conference, ASI hosted its annual general meeting on Friday 15 May (again, virtually on Zoom). Jennifer Spanier, outgoing president, went over old and new business from the past year. She announced recipients of the Kohlrabi Awards for their volunteer work, as well as the Hines Award recipient, Kendra Millis, for her years of dedicated service to the organization. Jennifer closed things off by passing over the virtual gavel to incoming president Meghan Brawley. Meghan has exciting plans, and we’re looking forward to the 2020–21 year!
