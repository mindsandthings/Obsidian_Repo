## Abstract

Mary Coe reports on the the Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand (BSANZ) conference, held in Melbourne on 28–9 November 2019.

The Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand (BSANZ) marked its 50th anniversary in 2019 and held its conference in conjunction with the 13th Australian Library History Forum at the University of Melbourne on 28–9 November. In keeping with the theme of tradition and innovation, the conference presentations ranged from medieval publishing to digital humanities, with much content in between on topics as diverse as Old English royal geneaology, Australian colonial prison libraries and BookTube Readathons.

The conference opened with a Welcome to Country by Wurundjeri Elder Uncle Perry Wandin, cultural heritage officer at the Wurundjeri Land Council, followed by the presentation of the inaugural BSANZ Award for Bibliographic Studies to Wallace Kirsop, a founding member of BSANZ. In his acceptance speech, Wallace reflected on the need to move beyond a Eurocentric focus on history. This was a subject that continued throughout the conference, most notably in Adria Castellucci’s paper on confronting racism in natural-history library collections and Nicole Kearney’s lament that the Biodiversity Heritage Library mainly consists of work produced by Europeans and is not reflective of First Nations peoples. The awareness of this distorted view was also evident in the many Acknowledgments of Country by individual presenters.

The conference included over 30 papers organized into concurrent streams.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.21#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> The first day included streams on illustrated/artists’ books, personal libraries, colonial publishing, digital humanities, non-fiction genres and women’s fashions in books. The second day was biographical studies, GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, museums), e-books and reader experience, medieval publishing, provenance and library collections. The streams were bookended by keynote addresses and a panel session on library history.

The first keynote address was from Dr Russell Goulbourne at the University of Melbourne, who spoke about Voltaire’s practice as a reader, as evidenced by the marginalia and annotations in his personal library. Russell noted that while Voltaire’s library may seem a long way away from modern Australia, connections can be found with the French voyages to the South Seas and that Voltaire’s fascination with Australia also reveals the emergence of this part of the world into European consciousness. Voltaire’s practice of ‘active reading’, with pen in hand, created his working library, which was full of books with copious notes in the margins or slips of paper as annotations. Russell described Voltaire as a ‘voracious and at times vicious reader’, and judging by the critical and sometimes personal comments that he scribbled in his books, he would have been a dangerous presence on social media had that been available to him!

Dr Mary Carroll from Charles Sturt University started the second day with her reflections on the Australian Library History Forums (ALHF). Following on from the panel session that ended the first day on why library history matters, she offered many reasons for continuing to consider the evolution and development of libraries and highlighted the need to fill in the gaps in history that are missing due to the focus on the dominant culture. Mary also noted the continuing partnerships between the ALHF and other organizations, such as BSANZ, that enables library history to become part of the largely scholarly forum. These partnerships and the many interdisciplinary projects that were in evidence during the conference are certainly a strength of this community. Indexers might take note and attempt to create similar connections with like-minded folk in other fields if they wish to keep their societies alive and thriving.

Dr Christopher Thomson from the University of Canterbury (UC) finished the conference with an overview of digital humanities and the projects currently being conducted at the UC Arts Digital Lab. Christopher suggested that while computational research methods are valuable in the humanities, ‘we still need the slowness of books, and we need our attention back’. This brought us full circle back to the first keynote on Voltaire’s ‘active reading’ practices. Considering this conference as a whole, it is clear that tradition and innovation do indeed go hand in hand. Looking back in time can help us to make sense of the present use of books and libraries and to better imagine where we might go in the future as readers.

BSANZ invited me to present a paper on my research and supported my attendance at the conference with a student bursary.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.21#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup> The title of my paper was ‘A sensemaking approach to active e-book indexes’. I will be submitting the full paper for publication in the society’s journal, _Script & Print_, and will not say much about it here, but I can give you a snippet in the form of the introduction and first slide in my presentation:

> I have been involved in the world of indexing for many years, and people often come to me with questions about indexes. A friend of mine sent me this image last week and asked, ‘is this a normal index?’ Now, this was true serendipity as it presents a very good jumping-off point to tell you about my research.
> 
> When I first looked at this, I laughed because, as you can see, instead of page numbers after the index entries, there is the word ‘here’. Now each those ‘heres’ is hyperlinked back into the text, which is what I call an ‘active’ e-book index (as opposed to a passive index without hyperlinks, which is what you usually see in a print book with page numbers). But I’m very curious about the choice to use the word ‘here’ instead of a page number. Does this e-book even have pages? And if not, then where do these links lead us into the text? This sounds like a simple question, but it is anything but and it is also the crux of my research, which I’ll tell you more about over the next 20 minutes …
