## Abstract

Margaret Bird, a London-based historian with a lifelong love of Norfolk, has completed the mammoth task of indexing the four hefty volumes of the _Diary of Mary Hardy_ and four volumes of thematic essays based on the diary, _Mary Hardy and her world_. Christopher Pipe reports on the challenges she faced in creating the indexes and maintaining the central interests in their historical context.

April 2020 saw the completion of one person’s 32-year project to transcribe, annotate, index and provide a detailed commentary on the manuscript diary of Mary Hardy (1733–1809), the wife of a north Norfolk farmer and brewer. Extracts from the diary had been published before, but never the whole diary, which remains in the ownership of the diarist’s descendants.

## The scale of the task

Margaret Bird, a London-based historian with a lifelong love of Norfolk, dedicated herself to the mammoth task which has resulted in four hefty volumes of the _Diary_ (published in 2013) and now four more volumes of thematic essays based on the diary (_Mary Hardy and her world_) and setting its central interests in their historical context. A separate volume contains all the more routine diary entries that had been omitted from the main volumes in order to make them more readable, but which could be of interest to researchers with specialized interests. [Table 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.29#T1) shows a grand total of 4,312 text pages (including thousands of black-and-white illustrations), plus 335 pages of appendices; there are also captions to 189 colour plates and a staggering 822 pages of index entries.

Readers hoping to find every mention of a subject in the whole of the _Diary_ and its associated _Mary Hardy and her world_ volumes will have to look through the indexes to each volume in turn rather than a single consolidated index volume, because the volumes are available for purchase separately and because when the _Diary_ volumes were published it was not clear if and when work on the accompanying _Mary Hardy and her world_ volumes would be completed.

The supplementary volume of entries omitted from the main volumes is in a different format and is not indexed. As Margaret Bird admits, ‘There was no way I had time to index it. Also indexing would have broken me at this stressful time of preparing the material for printing.’

## Addressing the indexing problems

The nature of the project posed several indexing problems, some of them common to large-scale indexes and others shared with indexes to biographies:

•

consistency both within each volume’s index and across the nine separate indexes (one _Diary_ volume includes Mary Hardy’s nephew’s diary which is separately indexed)

•

forms of names (often abbreviated or spelled in different ways in the diary entries)

•

arrangement of subheadings and their typographic distinction

•

how to refer to pages when page design is still fluid.

– and all this while ensuring clarity for readers not familiar with north Norfolk’s geography, dialect and people.

On the other hand, several problems often facing indexers did not arise: the author, the publisher, the designer and the indexer were all the same person, and time was effectively unlimited because of the author’s single-minded determination to put in the hours necessary to achieve the quality she desired. Margaret told me,

> Anyone who praises the indexes is my friend for life. They took ages. I devoted 10–16 hours a day almost with no holiday, seven days a week, for a year to the World volumes … What slowed me was the moment of decision. Each sentence required perhaps 20 or 30 decisions: do I index this bit, and ought it not to be indexed under about five or six separate index entries or sub-entries?

These new _Mary Hardy and her world_ volumes have headings set in bold type with subheadings run on alphabetically, but longer entries continue with additional subheadings grouped under intermediate-level group headings (see [Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.29#F1)). Margaret explains:

> I do not always follow the British Standard on indexing. I am self-taught only, and just modelled my work on the best indexes I had in my books at home: E. S. de Beer’s to John Evelyn’s diary, and the volume of index accompanying the multi-volume Latham edition of Pepys. I find most modern indexes a bit too flimsy and minimalist.

Hazel Bell ([2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.29#core-R1): 10–11) acknowledges, ‘Diary entries … seem to offer indexers less opportunity for the devising of meaningful subheadings,’ but Margaret Bird has, following the models of the Evelyn and Pepys diaries mentioned above, written thousands of concise analytical subheadings.

## Personal names

Entries under personal names, as in many biographies, give brief details identifying the people and their relationships to each other and to the diarist’s family. They range from aristocrats to humble maidservants and labourers who may not even be clearly named in the diary entries. The entries under ‘boys’ in [Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.29#F2) shows how Margaret Bird has focused on each individual employed by the diarist’s husband, even when some of them are not named.

## Place names

Places featured in the books are often the small villages of north Norfolk, which have to be carefully identified and located for the benefit of readers unfamiliar with the area; they also range much further afield, with index entries including York, Hull, Norwich and London. The Hardys’ business prosperity depended on communications with the ‘outside’ world for supplies and customers. A notable feature of the four _Mary Hardy and her world_ volumes is their emphasis on transport, business and cultural links.

## Subjects

Major subject headings require numerous subheadings and groups of subheadings; in addition to the obviously important personal names and headings related to brewing and public houses, headings requiring such multi-level treatment include carts, chaises, harvests, horses, roads, sermons, sheep, shipping and shooting. As Margaret reports, ‘One reader tells me he likes to read the book by studying the index and then exploring the text to which an entry points!’

## Diary entry locators

The _Diary_ transcription had had to be indexed in a slightly different way from the new _World_ volumes. Margaret explains:

> I indexed the _Diary_ volumes as my transcription progressed, which is why they are anchored not by page number but by entry date. I had to find a way of accessing the vast material as I worked.
> 
> At the end of the project I thought that as I had found this anchoring extremely useful it was likely that others would as well. So I kept it. You can, for instance, find the dates that ploughing and sowing began and ended in a season, or the frequency of beer deliveries to an outlet, or the dates of fairs from one year to the next, or the frequency of the diarist’s attendance at the village Sunday school …

[Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.29#F3) shows part of an entry from the _Diary_ volumes. What look at first glance like over-long strings of page references are in fact slightly shorter lists, because each locator (in the form 17.5.01, for example) represents the date of the relevant diary entry, rather than a simple page number. Finding the right passage is helped by the fact that the great majority of diary entries are short – only a few lines of terse facts – so locators in the form of dates are like using paragraph numbers, with very short paragraphs. After other subheadings for this employee of the Hardys shown in [Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2020.29#F3) come numerous mentions of his attendance at (religious) meetings in nearby Briston, Cley and Sheringham.

Some entries do unavoidably have longer-than-usual strings of locators, because there is very little to differentiate (for example) regular deliveries of beer to Mr Hardy’s trade customers. In another context, they could be treated as passing references, not worth indexing; but here routine events are recorded methodically, so it is possible to analyse patterns of business, of farming, of brewing, of travel, of weather and of social interactions. A detailed picture emerges of the lives of moderately prosperous families; they do not live in the great houses, they do not spend a great deal of time in London, they do not direct national politics, but they are influenced by what is going on in the world; they vote in parliamentary elections, play their part in local affairs and religious movements and become active in Nonconformist religion in the area.

Even with oft-repeated events such as churchgoing, family visits, storms, the diarist’s son’s trips to market or her maidservants doing the washing, the date order of the locators faithfully reflects the family’s daily life and concerns, and may suggest further lines of historical enquiry.
