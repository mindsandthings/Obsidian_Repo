## Abstract

The indexing of biography as a genre, per se, is reconsidered with respect to subject indexing in general and the histories of lives in particular. The index of a biography of the chess player Bobby Fischer is compared with the index of a history of chess at the height of the Cold War conflict in which Bobby Fischer was the central protagonist. Some received theory of the indexing of biographies is critiqued and challenged by practical comparisons. Indexing from a literary perspective is considered and contrasted with back-of-book indexing from an information retrieval standpoint.

A number of years ago in the mid-2000s, before a controlled list of subject specialisms was introduced to the directory of ‘Indexers Available’ on the website of the Society of Indexers (SI), it was possible to freely enter any subject on which an indexer felt able to offer subject knowledge.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> Although I have never achieved accomplishment as a chess player, I had from an early age been engaged by the game and had absorbed enough awareness of its history and administration to feel confident that I was able to index chess works. As it turned out, I emerged as the only SI indexer to enter chess as a subject specialism over a brief number of years.

## _White king and red queen_: how the Cold War was fought on the chessboard

The narrow subject area did not result in the acquisition of a great number of commissions despite the vast literature devoted to chess. The bulk of my work at the time remained with indexing military history, a field not altogether unrelated to chess. However, one significant chess work which came my way was _White king and red queen: how the Cold War was fought on the chessboard_ ([Johnson, 2007](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#core-r6)). It was an instructive and enjoyable work to index in many aspects, from subject content to a well-structured text, and drawing on a wide range of sources from chess history and the East–West post-war political relationship. The central, dominating and culminating feature of this history was the World Chess Championship match between Robert James ‘Bobby’ Fischer (1943–2008) and Boris Spassky (b. 1937) which took place in Reykjavik, Iceland, from 11 July to 1 September 1972. Not only was this a major event in sporting history and international power politics, against the backdrop of the Cold War, the Vietnam War and the tensions created by the division of Germany concentrated at the Berlin Wall, but it was also the high point of success of Bobby Fischer’s chess career. It was the central and major event in Fischer’s life as a whole and thus the biography of Fischer is embedded into and to a large part integrated with the Soviet–United States, and East–West, confrontation of ideologies and military rivalries. Fischer’s subsequent life was one of conflict with the US establishment and ultimately his tragic decline and disintegration, beginning with his increasingly eccentric disposition, coupled with the complexity of his genius, and ending through psychological trauma and mental illness in paranoia and physical ill health. Fischer had an IQ of over 180 and by many is adjudged to have a strong claim to be regarded as the greatest chess player of all time. In addition to his supreme talent, he also had almost super-human application and dedication to practice, chess analysis and understanding.

> The burden placed on Fischer was immense, since he carried not only the pressures of sporting competition at the highest level, but also the highly charged identification of his match against Spassky as symbolically representative of the Soviet–US struggle for world dominance, and a propaganda-related vindication of their respective systems, which a victory in the World Chess Championship would bring. To others in the chess world the symbolism was transcended by the combative nature of chess and the intellectual conflict embodied in the game, irrespective of any wider connotations. The Soviet Union had politicized chess by a state-backed system throughout the USSR, making success at the national game a demonstration of the superiority of the communist system. The US had had little success in beating the Soviet Union at either an individual or team level. Fischer became US champion before his fifteenth birthday and his brilliance made him the only US player with a realistic chance of beating the Soviet players and the machine-like system which the USSR had created since the First World War and consolidated following the USSR’s dominance of Eastern Europe after the Second World War. The Soviet system and players worked collectively to try to defeat Fischer in the qualifying stages of the World Championship and it was thus a significant feat by Fischer simply to reach the stage of challenging the incumbent champion. His ultimate victory at the age of 29, both on the board and with respect to the continuing and ensuing ‘off-board’ psychological battles, was a major achievement by an individual caught up in seismic political events and rivalry between the superpowers and against all the distractions that that entailed.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup>

### Questions arising

In indexing terms it is an open question whether the contents of this book represent in effect, and as a priority, a biography, or a subject history of chess or power politics. Is the main topic Fischer, chess or the Cold War? All three have strong claims. Perhaps co-equal main topics is the only realistic approach. Alternatively, the book could be indexed without being over-conscious of a single overarching major topic (known in recent jargon as the metatopic). Under which of these three headings would the book be classified in the library? It appears that the chess game has possibly won the classification question (Dewey 794.109), but what of indexing? Does the biographical material detailed above constitute a ‘soft text’ as defined by Bell in the opening section of _Indexing biographies_ ([Bell, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#core-r3): 1–2)? Is indexing biographical material within a wider historical context necessarily different from indexing a clearly dedicated biography of a single life from birth to death? Why should the history of a life be seen as requiring subjective value judgements by the indexer compared with any other history? Does the author make these judgements rather than the indexer, or does the indexer superimpose a judgement? Is it useful to make distinctions between the concepts of information, knowledge or even data when indexing a book’s content? Have these terms been sufficiently defined and a common understanding as to their usage been established?

## _Endgame_: the spectacular rise and fall of Bobby Fischer

Leaving these far-reaching questions aside temporarily to turn in a sense to the other side of the equation, in 2010 I was surprised to be contacted by the respected indexer Hazel K. Bell, author of the above-mentioned _Indexing biographies_. She had received a commission to index a biography of Bobby Fischer entitled _Endgame_ ([Brady, 2011](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#core-r4)). Having noted my special subject on ‘Indexers Available’, she sought my advice to help her understand the competition levels and tournament organization in the chess world and some of the game’s technical terminology. This I was pleased to supply as far as my knowledge extended. As is widely known, Bell is well versed in indexing biography and it is currently appropriate for this discussion that the fourth edition of her _Indexing biographies and other stories of human lives_ ([Bell, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#core-r3)) has recently been published and reviewed in meticulous detail (and in a full comparison with all previous editions dating from the first edition of 1992) in the pages of this journal.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup> A further review by Paula Clarke Bain appears on the website of the Chartered Institute of Editing and Proofreading.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup> Neither of these reviews critically examines the genre of biography vis-à-vis the subject indexing considerations raised by a person’s life story. The reviews accept uncritically the premise and following assumptions without seeking to question their validity. The fact that _Indexing biographies_ has gone through four editions is testimony to the perceived authority of this work in this aspect of indexing. The indexing of biographies does not receive extensive coverage in the standard texts on book indexing, but there has always been continuing, if intermittent, discussion within the indexing societies about how to approach the main topic or metatopic of any book, the extent of the entry and its subdivision. This is an ever-present consideration when indexing a biography, since the name of the biographical subject invariably forms a centrally important, sizable and sought-after entry (see [Bell, 1989](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#core-r1); [1990](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#core-r2)).

## _White king_ compared with _Endgame_

_White king_ was published a year before the death of Bobby Fischer and _Endgame_ two years after his death, although this does not materially affect the narratives. The two books overlap chronologically to a large extent. _White king_ begins with the history of chess and its furtherance in the East from the time of the Russian Revolution and concludes with an assessment of East–West relations in about 2006. _Endgame_, as one might expect, begins and ends with Fischer’s lifespan. It would be correct, but simplistic, to say that _Endgame_, as a declared biography, deals with Fischer’s life in the context of the politics, whereas _White king_ is concerned with the politics in which Fischer’s life is one ever-present aspect. However, whether we prioritize or emphasize any of the subjects, Fischer, chess or the Cold War, or give them co-equal importance, they remain the three highly integrated subjects which must be indexed. In this regard it can be said that all indexing is subject indexing with names and titles denoting subjects just as much as nouns in index entries.

Is biography therefore a special case for indexing in any real sense, or can it be successfully approached without different precepts or delineating special conditions and solutions? Special consideration to a metatopic occurs in many indexes which are not biographies. It would seem appropriate to confine the entry devoted to a biography’s subject to the close personal details of the life, as far as possible, and to index the life’s work, achievements and concerns of the individual in separate entries. However, the proviso applies that not all important subheadings can be made to command main-entry-point status, since they are qualifying words or phrases rather than noun entities. The situation into which the individual is born and which they inherit, and their close personal life, can be separated to some extent from the impact the individual has on their surroundings, with only essential brief subheadings or references to their work in their named entry. In this way it is possible to avoid ‘an index within an index’, which can easily develop under the name of the biographical subject. Such adaptable criteria are applicable for any metatopic. Conversely, as noted below, the so called ‘index within an index’ can provide a central coordinating role if constructed judiciously and it would be wise not to dismiss consideration of this function, but to adopt it, especially in a large index.

## The extent and composition of the metatopic entry

Although there has been a faint but discernible trend in favour of a briefly tailored entry for the metatopic, there are examples of large and expansive entries attributable to well-established indexing authorities. G. Norman Knight, for example, in his index to _Superior person: a portrait of Curzon and his circle in late Victorian England_ ([Rose, 1969](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#core-r7)), preferred a long, classified, but well-disciplined entry. Since such an entry can hardly be missed by the index user, the argument that subheadings are swamped or buried cannot be made convincingly. Knight uses bold type and small capitals to create an eminently clear and approachable entry. This is workable and practical and, although it can be described as an ‘index within an index’, such a designation has no bearing on its effectiveness; indeed, the cross-referencing of this entry makes a virtue of its central position, providing a guide and fulfilling a coordinating role in relation to other entries. The first-level subheadings of Knight’s index, where he uses small capitals, are as follows (the numerals in parentheses indicating the number of second-level subheadings).

> **Curzon, George Nathaniel** (later Marquess Curzon of Kedleston) (1859–1925)
> 
> characteristics (24)
> 
> education: _see_ Paraman, Miss;
> 
> Wixenford; Eton; Balliol
> 
> finances (20)
> 
> health (13)
> 
> honours (16)
> 
> letters: From and to, _see under_ names of people or senders<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup>
> 
> marriages, _see_ Leiter, Mary, _and_ Duggan, Grace
> 
> pastimes (8)
> 
> political career (8)
> 
> publications
> 
> religion
> 
> travel

Knight draws attention to this special entry in the introductory explanatory note, a practice one feels ought to be adopted more widely to assist the index user:

> The entry under **Curzon, George Nathaniel**, has been confined to those sub-headings which cannot be readily found under other entries. Apart from that heading his name has throughout the index been abbreviated to C.

It should be noted that this main entry has no undifferentiated page locators and there is qualifying context to every entry which Knight has made. It is worthy of thought in indexing that locators which do not have a qualifying context should be considered for omission in the editing process, but no blanket rule is suggested. Another point of note is that Knight uses the present simple tense for subheadings, some of which by modern standards seem to be over-elaborate. For example:

> **Curzon, George Nathaniel** (later Marquess
> 
> Curzon of Kedleston) (1859–1925)
> 
> finances: spends on 2nd world tour
> 
> £353 or £1 14s. a day, as compared with £1 15s. a day for 1st, 250

Neither the index to _White king_ nor that to _Endgame_ employ this level of descriptive detail for subheadings. An index is concerned with helping readers to find information in the text and should not be concerned with providing such information in the index in this unnecessarily duplicating way. The subsubheading

> world tours expenditure, 250

would seem to be sufficient.

The use of the present tense dramatizes the narrative and brings past events into the immediate. Can this be justified? The text is not written in the present tense. It would seem a presumption by the indexer to make a change. This is a concomitant result of regarding an index as a literary form rather than purely as an information retrieval device. The fact that an index is fundamentally an information retrieval device and not a literary form seems to be mildly contentious within professional indexing circles. This is expressed by considering whether an index is objectively ‘compiled’ or subjectively ‘written’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#fn6" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn6">6</a></sup> Use of the present tense is one example of literary indexing being used in an expressive way, thereby superimposing another layer of complex considerations on an already labyrinthine task. The back-of-book index is a limited vehicle for its purpose, requiring a high degree of judicious compromise. The best indexes appear to simplify the complexity of the subject matter while poor indexes manage to obfuscate the indexing of simple texts.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#fn7" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn7">7</a></sup>

A similar entry covering finances in _Endgame_ is as follows:

> Fischer, Bobby (aka Robert James) finances 82, 89, 139, 148–9, 150–1, 173, 179, 209, 215, 216–17, 234, 246–7, 248, 265, 271, 273, 278, 280, 283, 284–5, 289
> 
> commercial offers 249–52, 274–5
> 
> donations to the World Wide Church of God 247, 252–3
> 
> and film in Iceland 370
> 
> money from his mother 267, 285
> 
> posthumous estate 384–5
> 
> prize money 148–9, 151, 185, 204, 243, 303
> 
> property stored in Pasadena 287, 323, 324–6
> 
> royalties 266, 314–16
> 
> Swiss bank account 303, 306, 320, 356, 374
> 
> taxes 3, 293, 302, 303, 335, 357, 384, 389

Here the use of the past tense in the subsubheadings is consistent with the text and the formulation is much more concise.

The suggestion made by Gordon Carey and others (discussed by [Bell, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#core-r3): 75–6, 78) that the main topic can be omitted provides interesting discussion in theory, but there are few examples of this extreme solution and it is not followed in the reality of everyday practice by most qualified indexers. As so often in indexing, measured balance provides the way forward and each book has its own indexing problems and resolutions, whether that be within a literary genre such as biography or in universally applied subject indexing. The accumulated experience of seasoned indexers allows them to consciously refer back to previously indexed books or possibly unconsciously to select remedies to the new difficulties that a work may present. However, it has to be disputed that:

> Special subjects consist of bodies of lore of academic disciplines, established facts. They may be provided with standardised terminology and formalised structure for their texts. Biographies involve none of these, being just books about people, the lives they lead, their various activities and relationships, told in the author’s own way. They are non-standardised. ([Bell, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#core-r3): 6)

This is to miss the elementary point that ‘their various activities’ are almost always, incontrovertibly, subject specialisms. Biographies are about achievement and/or notoriety always in a field of activity engaged in by the individual. This forms the subject content. It is indisputable that chess was the subject specialism of Bobby Fischer’s life as a biographical or historical fact. The actuality is that biography is both a literary genre _and_ a subject specialism, depending on the spheres of activity of the personality concerned. To say that ‘biography is a genre, not a subject specialism’ ([Bell, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#core-r3): 6.), as though the two features are mutually exclusive, cannot be supported and is not borne out in practice as the comparison of _White king_ and _Endgame_ demonstrates. Those with a background in information science are clear about ‘form’ and ‘subject’ as distinct features of bibliographic and materiographic description and descriptive cataloguing, particularly with regard to non-book materials. This point is further reinforced by the fact that knowledge of, and advice on, the subject area was rightfully sought for the index to _Endgame_.

Back-of-book indexers from a literary background often take a more fluid and imaginative approach to indexing, which can diverge from that of indexers with a background in information studies. The concept of ‘soft texts’ posed by [Bell (2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#core-r3): 1–2) is tenuous. There is nothing in the indexes of either _White king_ or _Endgame_ which indicates that this concept was of practical value in the indexing strategies employed. Data are raw facts and figures; information is interpreted, presented and annotated data; and knowledge is what a human individual or an institution has absorbed and learned. An index is an information retrieval device, not a knowledge retrieval device. To use the example of meteorology: the reported values and parameters of observation are the data, the analysis and forecast are information and the developed science of meteorology is the knowledge. The categories of data, information and knowledge pervade almost all indexing and it is not useful to say that, in indexing treatment, ‘soft’ texts can be distinguished, much less separated, from documentary ones. Life stories and subject material are inseparable and biographers make extensive use of documentary sources. Personal relationships and emotions _are documented_; thus it seems controversial at the least to state, ‘The indexer of the humanities … is often dealing with accounts of personal relationships and emotions rather than with documentary facts: . .’([Bell, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#core-r3): 1). To substantiate this Bell draws on sources from outside professional indexing, such as contributions to _LOGOS: a journal of modern society and culture_. Such general sociological material does not have the authority of the professional indexing literature in the field.

## Comparison of major entries in _White king_ and _Endgame_

The main entries for the featured personality in the _White king_ and _Endgame_ indexes are shown in [Figures 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#F1) and [2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#F2).

An inconsistent use of the past and present tense is made in subheadings in the index to _Endgame_. Both index entries also raise familiar questions concerning undifferentiated page references. The nature of the emphases in the respective texts led to the financial aspect being differently catered for in _White king_ under the heading

> prize money, sponsorship and funding

with _see_ references

> sponsorship _see_ prize money, sponsorship and funding
> 
> funding _see_ prize money, sponsorship and funding

There is no suggestion that the entries were selected necessarily ‘on the basis of subjective value judgement’, as put forward by Hazel Bell and Douglas Mathews ([Bell, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#core-r3): 1) or that biographical index entries preclude subject-indexing considerations. Indeed the use of ‘and’ in subheadings distances the indexer from any hint of unnecessarily imposing an intervening judgemental opinion. The author’s judgements should thus be preserved in their integrity as far as possible and not adjusted or interpreted differently by the indexer.

### Index coverage of the 1972 World Championship match between Fischer and Spassky

As outlined earlier, the main subject of Fischer’s life coincided with Cold War politics and chess history in a closely integrated way. The entry for the 1972 World Championship match was therefore of similar importance to the main personality name entry. In _Endgame_ this entry is made under

> Spassky–Fischer World Championship match (1972)

Although it is the convention to cite the reigning world champion first and the challenger second, reversing this order was worthy of consideration, given that Fischer was the main subject of the book and all is dealt with from his perspective, making his name the more likely sought term.

In the _White king_ index the match was approached as a subheading under the direct entry

> World Championship matches
> 
> Finals
> 
> Fischer v Spassky (1972)

with references from both Fischer and Spassky. No such references from general to specific are supplied under the main Fischer entry in _Endgame_. This illustrates again the essential consideration of subject concerns, whether or not the context may be biographical, and further that documented texts are inseparable from biographical narratives. The full entries are shown in [Figures 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#F3) and [4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#F4), for _Endgame_ and _White king_, respectively.

The alphabetical ordering of the subheadings for games may appear anomalous, but groups of games were significant as the match moved from Spassky’s early lead through many ‘off-board’ interruptions to Fischer establishing the upper hand. The openings were significant as Fischer made unexpected changes at crucial points in the match to counter the Soviet preparations and analysis. This is an arbitrary, debatable point of subject indexing, irrespective of being part of a biographical or narrative text, and much less a conception of a ‘soft text’.

## Conclusion

Biography is a literary genre, but it does not follow from this that the indexing of biography is a separate genre for indexing purposes. The subject indexing of the history of a life, as a recognized biographical narrative (_Endgame_), with the personality as the metatopic, requires no difference in indexing treatment from the subject indexing of a historical subject in which the main character pervades the story and in which other significant personalities appear (_White king_). The divergent approaches produced by indexing from a literary or an information science starting point have been seen to be in contradistinction. Indexing from a literary viewpoint is replete with, and invites, subjective complications, and it generates assumptions, which the approach from an information retrieval stance is endeavouring, as far as possible, to objectively eliminate in the interests of clarity for the index user. For the author and reader to indulge in emotional presentation, enthusiasm and reaction is intrinsic, but it is not for the indexer to interpose sentiment, interpret emotion or attempt to express slanted views during the indexing process, however well intentioned. The index is a signpost; its function is to direct and locate and not to state whether the destination is good, bad or indifferent. If it fulfils this function efficiently it will have succeeded in every respect. The intrusion of an indexer’s subjective value judgements is undesirable and a back-of-book index is too limited a device to pose as a literary form or convey such developed meanings and connotations. More generally, ‘The indexing of individual books is usually also regarded as something quite separate from other kinds of indexing, but this is not the case’ ([Foskett, 1996](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.16#core-r5): 223). The clear echo here by inference is that indexing biography is not something apart from other kinds of subject indexing.

Though a certain amount of creativity in choosing the most appropriate words may be implied by referring to indexes being ‘written’, whereas ‘compilation’ might suggest to some a more automatic, less skilful process. The controversial question of skill level requirements is identified in the editorial in the September 2012 issue of _The Indexer_ (30(3), 113), an issue that was largely devoted to the theme of biography indexing. In some ways it mirrors the unnecessary academic divide between science, the humanities and literature.
