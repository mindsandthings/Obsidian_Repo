## Abstract

National Indexing Day (#indexday), inaugurated in 2017 to celebrate the foundation of the Society of Indexers and promote the profession of indexing, again had to take place virtually in 2021 due to COVID-19 restrictions. However, indexers are nothing if not imaginative, engaging with social media with enthusiasm and generating ‘likes’ and ‘retweets’ from early morning until late evening. After setting out the background to National Indexing Day (NID), this article gives a flavour of how NID 2021 helped to raise the profile of indexing and indexers in the online environment.

## The origins of National Indexing Day

Raising the profile of indexing is crucial for ensuring that readers continue to have access to user-friendly, professionally produced analytical indexes. National Indexing Day was inaugurated in 2017 at the suggestion of Paula Clarke Bain and Ruth Ellis, who were running the Society of Indexers’ social media accounts. It aims to provide a focus for all things index-related, helping to dispel some of the myths and mystique surrounding what is a niche profession and also to improve the dialogue between indexers and their main clients – publishers. Since it is publishers who hold the purse strings and commission the majority of indexes (or decide not to do so), they play a key role in the future of the profession; it is vital that they understand the role of the indexer and how indexes add value to any publication.

The date for the first National Indexing Day, 30 March 2017, was chosen to commemorate the actual anniversary of the founding of the Society of Indexers (SI) by G. Norman Knight 60 years earlier, in 1957. With only a few weeks for planning and organization (see [Ellis, 2017)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#core-R6), it had to be essentially a digital event, masterminded by Ruth Ellis and Paula Clarke Bain on Facebook and Twitter, which spread the message around the world. Indexers and indexing societies in Australia and North America joined in the celebration, together with editing organizations, publishers and authors. The event also caught the attention of several national newspapers.

In 2018 and 2019, with a longer lead time, the virtual events were augmented by half-day face-to-face events for the key target audience – editors and publishers. These comprised a series of presentations on good indexing practice,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#fn1" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn1">1</a></sup> how indexing software is used, and the impact of digital developments and embedded indexing (see [Ellis et al., 2018](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#core-R8); [Kingdom, 2019)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#core-R9). Participants admitted to having had little idea of what the indexing process really involved and appreciated the opportunity to spend an afternoon learning more about it and also meeting actual indexers. It was hoped that they would be able to take what they had learnt back to their in-house colleagues, thus spreading the indexing message more widely.

A similar event was planned for 2020, but by early March, as the true nature of the pandemic was becoming apparent, the face-to-face event was cancelled and promoting indexing and indexers was restricted once more to the online environment. Inevitably, with the mainstream media focusing on the developing pandemic situation, there was no possibility of receiving the kind of coverage the first National Indexing Day had enjoyed in 2017. However, by highlighting new material through the SI social media accounts (rather than just promoting clicks to existing pages on the SI website), considerable interest and interaction were generated (see [Kingdom, 2020)](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#core-R10). Throughout the day, humour played an important role in attracting interest; various posts highlighted unusual and intriguing index entries and amusing juxtapositions. In addition to a competition on indexing a short booklet from the SI website, a particularly successful innovation was a fun quiz – identifying the subjects of several biographies from snippets of their indexes.

## National Indexing Day 2021 (#indexday)

> Happy #indexday to those oft unsung heroes, the indexers. They walk among us, shining lights in the darkness.
> 
> Martin Bain, Twitter, 30 March 2021

The fifth National Indexing Day on 30 March 2021, with lockdown restrictions still in place and many people still working from home, was again held online, following a similar pattern to the successful 2020 event. Most activity took place on Twitter, where reaction tends to be more instantaneous, but some posts were also shared on Facebook and LinkedIn. For SI Internet director Ruth Ellis, who was coordinating the event, it was a very long and busy day, but she even found time to put the finishing touches to an index that was going to print the next day, cook a family meal, and complete some other domestic tasks. As well as posts from established indexers, especially members of the SI Executive Board, it was particularly encouraging to see the enthusiasm with which newer members of the Society, including several student indexers, engaged with the event.

The day began with a series of tweets explaining the role of the Society and the background to National indexing Day; these were soon retweeted and followed by ‘Happy Indexing Day’ messages from individuals and from organizations ranging from the School Library Association to the Society for the Study of Labour History. The event was already reaching beyond the narrow confines of the indexing community and demonstrating the importance of good indexes in many fields. It was particularly gratifying to see that it was catching the attention of authors and publishers, including several umbrella bodies –the Publishers’ Association, the Independent Publishers Guild and the Publishing Training Centre. The editorial director of Troubador Publishing tweeted a reminder about when the index should be prepared, while Facet Publishing invited Claire McGuinness, author of _The academic teaching librarian’s handbook_, to reflect on her experience of preparing an index for her own book, outlining why indexes are important and providing useful tips for other authors preparing their own indexes.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#fn2" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn2">2</a></sup>

Needless to say, indexers (and others) posted index-type tweets, such as

> Celebrations, national Fulfilment, professional INDEXING, DAY OF,

as well as sharing details of current indexing work and particularly interesting indexes and juxtapositions of index entries. SI chair Nicola King pointed out that ‘“When I’m 64” by the Beatles came out in 1967, so it’s only 54 now. Unlike @ indexers which is 64 today’, while indexer Rohan Bolton pointed out that she was not only celebrating #indexday but also her own birthday.

Although indexers focus on their specialist subjects, there is always something new to learn. As Anna Lord tweeted, ‘Every day is a school day as an indexer. In recent months I have learnt about Victorian clergy, Italian shoemakers, pulp fiction (the genre not the film) and writers’ hideaways, among many other things.’ And to illustrate the variety in the day-to-day life of an indexer, Lyndsey Marshall tweeted an image of the word cloud she had constructed from some of the frequently used terms from the books she had recently indexed ([Figure 1](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#F1)).

Several researchers tweeted their gratitude for well-prepared indexes, while the absence or inadequacy of indexes also received attention. Bridget Houlton retweeted Chris Power’s comment on Penelope Fitzgerald’s review of Sylvia Townsend Warner’s letters in the _London Review of Books_, where William Maxwell is criticized for not providing much of an index and Fitzgerald suggests one of her own:

> celibacy, STW recommends
> 
> clearing up, STW’s passion for
> 
> coalshed, T. H. White’s diaries lost in
> 
> cold baths, STW advises, if piano kept in bathroom
> 
> Contre Sainte-Beuve, _STW translates_

In a variation on the selfie, Clare Playforth shared an image of her shelf of indexing reference books ([Figure 2](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#F2)), including, of course, a set of _The Indexer._ This idea was soon taken up and several more ‘shelfies’ appeared.

Naturally @The\_Indexer responded to this, highlighting the contents of the most recent issue (March 2021), especially the obituary of ‘master indexer’ Douglas Matthews (who was also mentioned in tweets from London Library members). _The Indexer_ also featured in tweets from our publisher, Liverpool University Press, about their indexing and archiving journals, and they took the opportunity to highlight their discount promotion for the latest edition of Hazel Bell’s _Indexing biographies_ ([Bell, 2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#core-R3)). Hazel Bell’s _Indexes and indexing in fact and fiction_ (2001) cropped up in a series of tweets about authors thanking their indexers, pointing out that likening it to ‘other traditional wifely tasks’ (in an author’s acknowledgement from 1984, quoted by Bell) was not appropriate. And on the subject of indexes in fiction, Paula Clarke Bain tweeted a link to her review for _The Indexer_ ([Bain, 2021](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#core-R1)) on the key plot role of the index in Susanna Clarke’s _Piranesi_ ([2020](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#core-R4)).

Throughout the day links to SI services, especially the directory of professional indexers and the training course and workshops, were posted, often in response to tweets from outside the Society. By mid-morning it was time for SI’s training course coordinator, Jan Worrall, to post the link to her light-hearted but very informative slide show, ‘What is it that indexers do?’, on how indexers use their considerable analytical skills to help readers find information.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#fn3" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn3">3</a></sup> This will have been an eye-opener to Twitter users who imagined that computers had made indexers redundant. Using images for additional impact, she clearly set out the differences between indexes, concordances and word searches, while also highlighting the role of computers in indexing and the creation of embedded index entries.

At the same time, librarians on a related thread were discussing the shortcomings of ebooks, Jill Boland bemoaning, ‘You can’t even get a “live” index in an ebook that links back to the page the entry refers to’, while Tom Peach considered that a ‘live, hyperlinked index would be the kind of extra, additional functionality you would assume publishers are talking about and now I really want this feature’. To which Scarlet Ferret Bookshop replied, ‘And an index is, technically, a straightforward thing to build in an ebook … I bet the issue is a lack of effort certain publishers put into their digital books … just clicking “export”’. SI chair Nicola King was quick to assure him that ‘yes, hyperlinked indexes can be done @indexers has expertise to help’.

Amongst various blog posts, the most prominent and widely shared via Twitter was Paula Clarke Bain’s brilliant and imaginative _A–Z of indexing_, which had been published that morning.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#fn4" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn4">4</a></sup> With a leavening of humour amongst the clearly written and informative entries, this glossary included such gems as

> biscuits: A useful addition to the indexing thought process. (see also tea)
> 
> brain fog: A phenomenon occurring after too many hours of intense indexing. Take a break. Eat or drink. Move.
> 
> ducks: A walk to see and feed them works wonders for this indexer when her brain gets too full.
> 
> shoeboxes: A vital piece of indexing equipment from the not-too-distant past.
> 
> yesterday: A deadline that cannot be met.
> 
> zeds: Let your tired brain do its thing overnight and you’ll be a better indexer tomorrow. Get some sleep. Nos da (good night).

As one of the instigators of National Indexing Day in 2017, Paula Clarke Bain continues to play a major role in publicizing the Society and the value of indexes and indexers more generally, using humour very effectively in the comedy book index thread on her blog,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#fn5" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn5">5</a></sup> but also providing much-needed guidance to authors on working with indexers ([Figure 3](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#F3)).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#fn6" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn6">6</a></sup>

National Indexing Day would not be complete without contributions from index scholar Dennis Duncan, a popular speaker at indexing conferences. He did not let the absence of indexes pass without comment, noting, ‘That time when the Index Society published their first book – called “What is an Index?”– and didn’t include an index’.<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#fn7" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn7">7</a></sup> Catherine Morris of the _TLS_ tweeted a link to Duncan’s entertaining piece in the _TLS_ archives on the index as political weapon,<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#fn8" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn8">8</a></sup> and with impeccable timing he was able to reveal the amazing cover design ([Figure 4](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#F4)) released by Penguin Books for his _Index, a history of the_, indexed by Paula Clarke [Bain and due out in September 2021](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#core-R1).<sup><a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#fn9" role="doc-noteref" id="body-ref-fn9">9</a></sup>

After the success of the biography quiz in 2020, Ruth Ellis put together a more challenging one this time round, using index extracts from eight of the cookbooks on her shelves (see [Figure 5](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/indexer.2021.29#F5)). All were by well-known writers and all published in the UK. As thoughts turned to food, these extracts were posted at lunchtime on both Twitter and Facebook, but it was not until later in the evening (just as she was hoping to reveal the answers and put her feet up) that this really took off when #cookbook Twitter picked up on it. Some extracts were identified fairly quickly; others were narrowed down to particular authors but not always to the precise book. It was interesting to note that Matt Kane tweeted, ‘I recognised the design before the recipes!’ suggesting that he did indeed use the index (extract 6).

The cookbook quiz proved to be by far the most popular thread of the day, leading to great exposure both for the Society of Indexers and for indexes more generally, and the ultimate reason for #indexday was encapsulated by journalist Rebecca Maer’s tweet in response to Jay Rayner and Nigella Lawson: ‘This index is subliminally imprinted on my mind from two decades of family cooking. I had no idea professional indexing existed. I can’t tell you how much this has changed my world view.’

## Looking ahead

Given the success of the vaccine rollout it is hoped that by 2022 it will be possible to hold another event for publishers and editors in London, along similar lines to those held in 2018 and 2019, with a series of presentations and the opportunity to meet and mingle with indexers.

The Index Society was established in 1877 by H. B. Wheatley with grand aspirations to provide indexes to ‘historical, scientific and other works’, but after only 12 years it ran into financial difficulties (Wheatley lamenting the public’s unwillingness to pay for indexes) and was merged with the British Record Society. It was to be another 67 years before the Society of Indexers was established. In 2002, facsimile copies of both _What is an index?_ (including the index) and _How to make an index_ were published by the Society of Indexers.
