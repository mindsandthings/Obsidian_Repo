Publication: The Indexer: The International Journal of Indexing

Volume 38, Number 2

These extracts from reviews do not pretend to represent a complete survey of all reviews in journals and newspapers. We offer only a selection from quotations that readers have sent in. Our reproduction of comments is not a stamp of approval from _The Indexer_ upon the reviewer’s assessment of an index. Extracts are arranged alphabetically under the names of publishers, within the sections: Indexes praised; Two cheers!; Indexes censured; Indexes omitted.

## Indexes praised

**C. H. Beck**: _Johannes Kepler Gesammelte Werke, Band XXII: General Register_, by Peter Michael Schenkel, Hella Kothmann and Friedrich Seck (2017, 755 pp, €102). Rev. by Richard L. Kremer, _Journal for the History of Astronomy_, **50**(4).

Completing this Kepler edition has taken more than a century … Registers to such multi-year, complex editions inevitably embody compromises. The individual volumes were mostly prepared with indices but only of persons. And little effort was exerted to keep names and work titles consistent. As the editors in 1988 started preparing a General Register, they realized that some of the earlier volumes would require new or reworked indexing. And reworking one volume often required returning to and revising a previously indexed volume. Thus, the ‘scholarly public is here given a nearly 500-page register that is not free from variations in quality’ (p. 10).

The index of persons fills nearly 250 pages, the subject index (both Latin and German terms) about 200 pages, the geographical and historical index 30 pages, the biblical passages index 25 pages. The latter three indices are new and provide tools not available in the earlier individual volumes. Users of the _Gesammelte Werke_ will now be able, for example, to follow Kepler’s Bible reading, to notice that he cited the Old Testament and apocrypha much more frequently than the New. His knowledge of ancient geography is nicely displayed in the geographical index. Most useful will be the subject index, especially for studies of the diachronic development of Kepler’s rhetoric, interests, and conceptual tools. Tracing terms like ‘cantus,’ ‘experientia,’ ‘lux,’ ‘mundi systema Copernici,’ or ‘numerorum philosophia’ may prompt new understandings of Kepler’s intellectual life.

**Bookscout**: _Besturen in de desa: De binnenlandse bestuursambtenaar in Nederlands-Indië en Nederlands Nieuw-Guinea_, by Martin Fink (2018, 200 pp, €20.49). Rev. by Harry E. Poeze, _Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde_, **175**(1), 2019.

An extensive bibliography as well as notes and an index make the text accessible.

**Canadian Scholars**: _Canadian organized crime_, by S. Schneider (2017, 634 pp, $84.95). Rev. by Jay S. Albanese, _International Criminal Justice Review_, **29**(2), 2019.

A summary table of contents with chapter titles is provided at the front of the book, but a detailed table of contents would also be useful to the reader, especially for a book of this length. On the other hand, the book’s index and references are more complete than found in most other books of this type.

**Croatian Musicological Society**: _Bitka kod Sigeta i Nikola Šubić Zrinski u umjetnosti (glazba, likovne umjetnosti, književnost)/The battle at Szigetvár and Nikola Šubić Zrinski in Arts (Music, Visual Arts, Literature)_, by Stanislav Tuksar, Kristina Milković and Petra Babić (2018, 444 pp). Rev. by Gordan Ravančić, _International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music_, **50**(1–2), June–December 2019.

At the end of the book, after the list of illustrations, the very useful Index nominorum makes it easier to surf many names across various articles.

**Edinburgh University Press**: _Asia after Versailles: Asian perspectives on the Paris Peace Conference and the interwar order, 1919–1933_, by Urs Matthias Zachmann (2017, 248 pp, _£_85.37). Rev. by Andrew Cobbing, _Japan Review_, **32** (2019).

Each chapter is accompanied by an extensive bibliography, and there is a carefully produced index at the end.

**Harvard University Press**: _Enlisting faith: How the military chaplaincy shaped religion and state in modern America_, by Ronit Y. Stahl (2017, 384 pp, $39.95). Rev. by Christopher Nelson, _Naval War College Review_, **72**(2), Spring 2019.

… this is a scholarly work – it is detailed, includes extensive bibliographic notes, and, thankfully, has a fine index.

**Mythopoeic Society**: _Pamela Colman Smith: The untold story_, by Stuart R. Kaplan, Mary K. Greer, Elizabeth Foley O’Connor and Melinda Boyd Parsons (2018, 440 pp, _£_38). Rev. by Emily E. Auger, _Mythlore_, **37**(2(134)), Spring–Summer 2019.

The index is extensive, useful, and accurate.

**Oxford University Press**: _Rules for rebels: The science of victory in militant history_, by Max Abrahms (2018, 285 pp, $50). Rev. by Alex P. Schmid, _Perspectives on Terrorism_, **23**(2), April 2019.

The bibliography alone takes 45 pages and the very detailed index another 16 pages.

**Princeton University Press**: _Ireland’s immortals: A history of the gods of Irish myth_, by Mark Williams (2018, 608 pp, $27.95). Rev. by Raymond Cormier, _Eolas: The Journal of the American Society of Irish Medieval Studies_, **12**, 2019.

Readers will be grateful for the extensive editorial forethought that accompanies the volume: besides the more than twenty-five black and white illustrations, medieval Irish text editions and translations are cited, and there is also a pronunciation guide (containing spelling, stress, and sounds), a glossary of technical terms, a conspectus of medieval sources, each dated (tentatively) and with a brief summary, a thirty-eight page bibliography, and a detailed index.

**Sage Publications**: _Doing a literature review: Releasing the research imagination_, by Chris Hart (2018, 352 pp, _£_24.28). Rev. by Heidi Hollands, _British Journal of Midwifery_, 2019.

The contents page, list of figures and tables, reference section and index allow easy signposting for the reader and are both comprehensive and informative.

**Texas A & M University Press**: _Wildlife ecology and management in Mexico_, by Raul Valdez and Jose A. Ortega-S. (2019, 420 pp, _£_65.95). Rev. by David G. Hewitt, _Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America_, **101**(1), January 2020.

An eight-page index will help readers find references to topics and species of interest, and a two-page list of acronyms is helpful, especially for the many agencies in the Mexican government.

## Two cheers!

**Vantilt**: _‘Majesteit, U kent het werkelijke leven niet’: De oorlogs-dagboeken van minister van Buitenlandse Zaken Mr. E.N. van Kleffens_, ed. by Michael Riemens (2019, 511 pp, €29.95). Rev. by Harry A. Poeze, _Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde_, **175**(4), 2019.

An extensive index, with personal information added, is a merit of this book. But, Van Mook’s presence on 35 pages in the text is not recorded in the index. That is a serious shortcoming that hopefully did not afflict other individuals.

## Indexes censured

**Ambo/Anthos**: _Wereldgeschiedenis van Nederland_, ed. by Lex Heerma van Voss, Marjolein ‘t Hart et al. (2018, 751 pp, €39.99). Rev. by Harry E. Poeze, _Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde_, **175**(1), 2019.

On the Indonesian–Dutch conflict, lasting until 1962, only one entry on the 1945 Indonesian Proclamation is included. But this is only a minor critique. More serious is the fact that the index is incomplete. Quite a number of names in the text have not been given an entry in the index, in what looks like a rather slipshod and arbitrary fashion.

**Bloomsbury Academic**: _Sacred spaces and transnational networks in American Sufism: Bawa Muhaiyaddeen and contemporary shrine cultures_, by Merin Shobhana Xavier (2018, 267 pp, $35.96). Rev. by Frank J. Korom, _Asian Ethnology_, **78**(1).

Mechanically, the book still has a doctoral dissertation-type feel to it, despite the fact that Xavier thankfully trimmed it down somewhat for this publication. Even so, the book could have used much better editing, since there are numerous grammatical and typographical errors throughout. Foreign words are a jumble of terms from Persian, Arabic, and several South Asian languages, but no diacritical marks are used whatsoever, which leaves those readers who are linguistically sensitive perplexed and wanting more. A glossary of terms and their etymologies at minimum would have been useful here. Lastly, the index is quite short and inadequate. Several authors who are cited repeatedly are not included, while others cited less are, and those entries that are included are not listed exhaustively. Moreover, there are works cited in the text that are missing from the bibliography and works in the bibliography that are not cited in the book.

All of the above criticisms suggest to the careful reader that Bloomsbury and/or the author (or both) were not very studious or cautious in putting this book together, resulting in a number of serious flaws that cannot be summarized in a brief review.

What the reader is left with is a volume with some occasional flashes of insight, but one that seems sloppy, rushed, and published prematurely, despite the many superlatives printed on the back of the book provided by pre-publication reviewers who are not familiar with the ethnographic material presented therein. By the time I finished the book, I did not feel as compelled as when I began but was left uncomfortably wondering about its originality and questioning its citation of sources.

**CRC Press/Taylor & Francis**: _Regulatory toxicology_ (3rd edn), ed. by Shayne C. Gad (2019, 354 pp, $199.95). Rev. by Alan C. Katz, _International Journal of Toxicology_, **38**(5), 2019.

A key consideration in selection of a book for use as a reference text is the level of detail provided in the overall Index section. This book is somewhat disappointing in this regard. For example, significant coverage is appropriately devoted to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, particularly as a focal topic over several pages in chapter 2; however, this term is not found either by its full title or the abbreviated form in the Index at the back of the book.

**Four Courts Press**: _Valentine Lawless, Lord Cloncurry, 1773–1853: From United Irishman to Liberal politician_, by Karina Holton (2018, 352 pp, _£_55). Rev. by Sylvie Kleinman, _History Ireland_, **27**(1), January–February 2019.

The index is incomplete and contains errors: Lawless himself is totally missing, and one assumes that Richard and not his father John Philpot Curran (p. 43) met United Britons in London in January 1798.

**University of Notre Dame Press**: _Ireland’s revolutionary diplomat: A biography of Leopold Kerney_, by Barry Whelan (2019, 330 pp, _£_54.95). Rev. by Manus O’Riordan, _History Ireland_, **27**(5), September–October 2019.

In the _Dictionary of Irish Biography_, \[Michael\] Kennedy wrote that for the duration of the civil war ‘Kerney remained accredited to the Madrid \[_sic_\] government’. (The Republican government had actually moved to Valencia in November 1936.) Kennedy, however, next proceeded to charge that Kerney ‘did not attempt to hide his preferences for Franco and the nationalists’, and that ‘in March 1937 he unsuccessfully suggested to de Valera that Dublin recognise Franco before the collapse of the republican forces’. How true was this? I myself had failed to find any such interpretation in what had been published of Kerney’s March 1937 reports in Documents. Yet, on the other hand, how convincing should one consider Whelan’s caption to his cover photo that readers should ‘note that Kerney himself did not give an upright fascist salute’? Was this just special pleading? All the more reason to read Whelan’s biography from cover to cover, not least because of this publication’s inadequate index.

**Yale University Press**: _Urban rage: The revolt of the excluded_, by Mustafa Dikeç (2017, 264 pp, $26). Rev. by Jane Rongerude, _Journal of Planning Education and Research_, 1–2.

Interestingly, ‘planning’ does not appear as a heading in the index of the book although ‘urban transformation projects,’ ‘Section 8 housing,’ ‘suburbanization of poverty,’ and ‘urban space’ do. Yet, planners reading this book should be able to identify how exclusionary zoning practices, shortages of affordable rental housing, urban revitalization efforts, or even transportation and land use decisions could have contributed to each instance of urban rage.

## Indexes omitted

**Boekscout**: _Voor den Oost-Indiën en Batavia getekend: Hetvergeten verhaal van de mennekes: De historie der 23.400 Belgische vrijwilligers in het Koninklijk Nederlands Indisch Leger 1816–1930_, by Jaak Henri Poortman (2019, 281 pp, €23). Rev. by Harry E. Poeze, _Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Landen Volkenkunde_, **175**(1), 2019.

The absence of an index is a pity, especially as the book is a trove of genealogical information.

**Elikser**: _Foute dokters en de tabaksindustrie van Sumatra_, by Nizaar Makdoembaks (2019, 514 pp, €35). Rev. by Harry E. Poeze, _Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde_, **175**(1), 2019.

The book is amply illustrated with photos and drawings, but sadly lacks an index.

**Hogreffe Publishing**: _Internet addiction_, by Daria J. Kuss and Halley M. Pontes (2018, 86 pp, _£_19.90). Rev. by Vladan Starcevic, _Australasian Psychiatry_, **27**(6).

Unfortunately, the index is missing.

**LM Publishers**: _Persoonlijkdagboek van Hermann Hülsmann: Mijn reis naar Indië 1928–1929_, by Hermann Hülsmann, ed. by Noor Bekius-Hülsmann (2018, 512 pp, €29.50). Rev. by Harry E. Poeze, _Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde_, **175**(1), 2019.

This book is valuable for its scattered information on quite a number of enterprises and opinions. To make this information available, an index would have been of primary importance. I find it incomprehensible that neither editor nor publisher has insisted on an index. Much of their efforts in publishing this book are not as richly rewarded as they might have been.

**Mythopoeic Society**: _The Lamp-Post of the Southern California C. S. Lewis Society_, ed. by Laurie Hatch (journal). Rev. by Janet Brennan Croft, _Mythlore_, **38**(1), Fall–Winter 2019.

For the bibliographically-inclined, this is a journal which could use a history of publication, checklist of issues, and index of contents, as it is not widely held or indexed and the society’s website provides little archival information and no method for ordering back issues.

**Reaktion Books**: _Thomas Mann_, by Herbert Lehnert and Eva Wessell (2019, 175 pp, _£_11.99). Rev. by David Midgley, _Journal of European Studies_, **49**(3–4).

Wherever a specific piece of evidence is key to a fair appraisal of a particular episode in Mann’s life, an appropriate reference is provided in an endnote. (The addition of an index would have been helpful for pursuing the connections between such moments.)

**Thames & Hudson**: _World War II infographics_, by Jean Lopez, Nicolas Aubin, Vincent Bernard and Nicolas Guillerat (2019, 192 pp, $40). Rev. by Timothy J. Demy, _Naval War College Review_, **73**(1).

The book does not have an index.

## By the way …

**William Collins**: _For the record_, by David Cameron (2019, 752 pp, _£_25). Rev. by Patrick Kidd, Diary, _The Times_, 10 January 2020.

Jesse Norman, financial secretary to the Treasury, has finally read David Cameron’s memoir, or at least its index, and is distressed by the role he plays. His rebellion of Lords reform in 2012, which got what he recalls in _The Spectator_ as ‘a sudden burst of energetic pectoral massage’ from Cameron, is not worth a mention. At least he fared better than another Norman whose first instinct with books was to check his own entry. William F Buckley once sent Norman Mailer his memoir. Mailer turned to M in the index and found that Buckley had written in pen ‘Hi, Norman’. \[_Newer indexers may not be familiar with this story, which has appeared from time to time in_ The Indexer_, as well as being designated ‘best indical jest’ by John Sutherland in his_ Curiosities of literature _(Skyhorse Publishing, 2009). The note is usually given as ‘Hi, Norm’._\]

**Penguin**: _Margaret Thatcher: The authorized biography_, vol. III: _Herself alone_, by Charles Moore (2019, 1072 pp, _£_35). Rev. by Julian Glover, _Evening Standard_, 3 October 2019.

Whether you find the long section on \[Thatcher’s\] time in office from 1987 as interesting \[as the coverage of her years after power\] may depend on whether your name is in the index. \[_Index by SI member Christine Shuttleworth_.\]

**Oxford University Press**: _Book parts_, ed. by Dennis Duncan and Adam Smyth (2019, 352 pp, _£_30). Rev. by Matthew Lyons, _The Author_, Winter 2019.

The index to Charles Boyle’s 1698 work _Dr Bentley’s Dissertations_ – itself a polemic against the philologist Richard Bentley – extends its assault with entries under Bentley for ‘egregious dulness’, ‘pedantry’ and ‘familiar acquaintance with books he never saw’ … Jonathan Swift, for one, heaped scorn on ‘the Men who pretend to understand a Book, by scouting thro’ the Index, as if a traveller should go about to describe a Palace, when he had seen nothing but the Privy’. But this flexibility is surely one of the signature strengths of the book as we know it: a book with powerful navigational tools has a range of possibilities that a simple linear, unmarked, unmediated text has not.

Rev. by Ian Sansom, _The Spectator_, 11 January 2020.

The contents page begins forbiddingly by promising a ‘LIST OF FIGURES’ and a ‘LIST OF PLATES’, followed by yet another list, of the academic accomplishments and affiliations of the various ‘CONTRIBUTORS’, plus one of those irritating ‘A NOTE ON THE TYPE’ things (it’s Caslon or Caslon variants, and the fleurons are Caslon Ornaments or Adobe Caslon Pro, as if you care), before finally getting to a list of the contents of the 22 chapters, a ‘SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY’ and, thank goodness, an ‘INDEX’.

**Penguin Random House USA**: _Edison_, by Edmund Morris (2019, 800 pp, _£_29.53). Rev. by David Oshinsky, _New York Times_, 3 November 2019.

For some unexplained reason, Morris decided to write this saga in reverse, beginning with Edison’s final years and working backward to his birth in small-town Ohio in 1847 … This leads to a lot of flipping back and forth through the chapters, with a heavy reliance on the index to keep things straight.

**Picador**: _A place for everything: The curious history of alphabetical order_, by Judith Flanders (2020, 272 pp, _£_16.99). Rev. by Dennis Duncan, _The Spectator_, 1 February 2020.

In the middle of the last century, Robert Collison, one of the founders of the Society of Indexers, addressed himself to the question of what, exactly, an index is. In Collison’s loosest formulation, every time we organise the world around us so that we know where to find things, we are in fact indexing. He offers a pair of illustrations that could hardly be more 1950s if they were wearing brothel creepers:

> When a housewife makes a separate place for everything in the kitchen she is in fact creating a living index, for not only she, but all her household, will gradually get used to the system she has created and be able to discover things for themselves … A man will get into the habit of always putting change in one pocket, keys in another, cigarette-case in a third – an elementary indexing habit which stands him in good stead when he checks up in his hurry to the station to see whether he has remembered his season-ticket.

A mental index: that’s how women find the sugar and men find their cigarette-cases.

**University of Virginia Press**: _Unmentionable cuisine_, by Calvin Schwabe (1995, 476 pp, _£_53.13). Rev. by Burkhard Bilger, _New Yorker_, 25 November 2019.

The index at the end of Unmentionable Cuisine \[a cookbook of taboo foods\] is a gallery of horrors, or a good bedtime story, depending on the child: ‘Bat, baked,’ page 209; ‘Donkey brains,’ page 165; ‘Dormouse, stuffed,’ page 208.

## A dry rustling noise

For a minute I thought what a good idea it would be if he would marry Mavis \[a librarian\], and then I realized that Mavis wouldn’t look at anyone who didn’t make a dry rustling noise and have an index at the back and good binding.

_The honey flow_, by Kylie Tennant (Macmillan, 1956)

## Complete with index

Fancy your chances as Labour leader? Throw your hat in the ring quick – or announce you are giving it thought – to be assured of this must-have lottery ticket.

Since the morning of 13 December the list of runners and riders has swollen from two to four, then five, then six, now eight – and still counting. Any more and the _Guardian_ will soon need a special daily supplement, complete with index.

Bill Jamieson, ‘Who wants to lead this ideas-light Labour Party?’, _The Scotsman_, 2 January 2020

## A plea

Can I put forward a plea to UK publishers in general to make greater efforts to eliminate errors and omissions from indexes, which are after all one of the most useful features of non-fiction works?
