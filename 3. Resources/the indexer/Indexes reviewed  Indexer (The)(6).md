Publication: The Indexer: The International Journal of Indexing

Volume 38, Number 3

These extracts from reviews do not pretend to represent a complete survey of all reviews in journals and newspapers. We offer only a selection from quotations that readers have sent in. Our reproduction of comments is not a stamp of approval from _The Indexer_ upon the reviewer’s assessment of an index. Extracts are arranged alphabetically under the names of publishers, within the sections: Indexes praised; Two cheers!; Indexes censured; Indexes omitted.

## Indexes praised

**Brill**: _Early Christianity in the Lycus valley_, by Ulrich Huttner (2013, 492 pp, €193/€238). Rev. by Marlon Winedt, _The Bible Translator_, **70**(2), 2019.

The book has handy indexes of Persons, Subjects, Passages, and a combined index of Clergy and Functionaries (Prosopographic Index), which makes it much more user-friendly.

**CRC Press**: _The illustrated dictionary of toxicologic pathology and safety science_, ed. by P. S. Sahota et al. (2019, 671 pp, £180). Rev. by John R. Foster, _Toxicologic Pathology_, **48**(3), 2020.

What this text does not aim to be is a substitute for the INHAND publications since any pathologist coming across a new lesion would not easily be able to find the required terminology to apply to it even though the book contains an excellent and comprehensive index. A toxicologic pathologist would however be able to ensure that any descriptors that they do use in practice are correct for the particular pathology from the definitions present in this textbook.

**Manohar**: _Bengal MS records_ (vols 1–4), by Sir William Wilson Hunter (2018, 413 + 321 + 323 + 433 pp, £10.85). Rev. by Chittabrata Palit, _South Asia Research_, **40**(1), February 2020.

The index prepared by Hunter illustrates the exhaustive nature of research, so vital for colonialism in South Asia.

**New Internationalist (on behalf of the Fire Brigades Union)**: _Fighting fire: one hundred years of the Fire Brigades Union_, by Sian Moore et al. (2018, 336 pp, £9.99). Rev. by Meredith Burgmann, _Journal of Industrial Relations_, **62**(1), 2020.

The book is well referenced and has an index (which of course should be compulsory but is sometimes lamentably absent in self-published books).

**Northwestern University Press**: _Political anthropology_, by Helmuth Plessner, ed. by Heike Delitz and Robert Seyfert, tr. by Nils F. Scott (2018, 160 pp, $34.95). Rev. by Katya Haustein, _Times Literary Supplement_, 24 April 2020.

Nils F. Scott’s skilful translation, the editors’ all-encompassing introduction, Joachim Fischer’s nuanced epilogue, and the useful glossary and index turn this volume into a highly informative source.

**Palgrave Macmillan**: _Critical approaches to women and gender in higher education_, ed. by Pamela I. Eddy et al. (2017, 390 pp, €106.99/€83.29). Rev. by Lillan Lommel, _European Journal of Women’s Studies_, **27**(1), 2020.

An overarching integration of concepts used recurrently throughout the book, such as the disembodied and the ideal worker, could have extended the book’s theoretical contribution to the field of gender studies. The index at the end of the book, however, allows understanding how concepts are used in different passages.

**Pen & Sword History**: _The history of the Port of London: a vast emporium of all nations_, by Peter Stone (2017, xiv + 250 pp, £19.99). Rev. by Chris Ellmers, _International Journal of Maritime History_, **31**(3), 2019.

The book provides a basic table of contents but no list of illustrations. There is, however, an excellent cross referenced index to aid reader navigation.

**SPCK**: _The power of pictures in Christian thought: the use and abuse of images in the Bible and theology_, by C. Thiselton (2018, 1252 pp, £30). Rev. by Stephen Laird, _Theology_, **122**(6), 2019.

_The Power of Pictures_ is one of Thiselton’s more accessible publications and the volume can be appreciated in a number of ways: first, as a monograph exploring and debating the theoretical relationship between ‘pictures’ used in speech and writing and their meanings – treatment spans from the classical period to the contemporary world (Derrida, Gadamer, Heidegger, Nietzsche, Soskice and Wittgenstein receive particular attention in this ‘philosophical’ section). Second, there is commentary material on the evolving use of pictures across the biblical tradition. Third, readers who take the time to make focused use of the index of subjects will find themselves in possession of a minor gazetteer of many biblical pictures and interpretations (from almonds to yeast).

**Wildy, Simmonds & Hill**: _Legal research: a practitioner’s guide_, by Emily Allbon (2019, 463 pp, £45). Rev. by Margaret I. Katny, _Information Professional_, April–May 2020.

Nearly a third of the volume consists of appendices and indexes including a fascinating glossary of terms used in legal research, a names index to legal cases, and a useful guide to constructing searches in legal databases using search connectors … Although aimed at legal practitioners, it is an invaluable resource for legal librarians and information officers – an absolute must in any legal library.

## Two cheers!

**De Gruyter Saur**: _International and comparative librarianship: concepts and methods for global studies_, by Peter Johan Lor (2019, 905 pp, €69.95). Rev. by Kathleen Ladizesky, _Alexandria: The Journal of National and International Library and Information Issues_, **29**(3), 2019.

The index, which covers 40 pages, is strong on subjects. However, of more than 2000 citations in the bibliography, very few are to be found in the index which makes their textual location difficult.

## Indexes censured

**Academic Press**: _Self-control in animals and people_, by Michael J. Beran (2018, 332 pp, £115). Rev. by Richard Tunney, _Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology_, **72**(9), 2019.

The book would have benefitted from an author index and the subject index is quite brief.

**Baker Academic**: _Advocating for justice: an Evangelical vision for transforming systems and structures_, by Stephen Offutt et al. (2016, 216 pp, £14.99). Rev. by Heather Payne, _Transformation_, **36**(3), 2019.

\[A\] list of universally influential theological thinkers such as Augustine, Calvin and Luther and more recent names such as Barth, Bonhoeffer and Newbigin are cited as having articulated how the Lordship of Jesus Christ relates to politics or to other structures in society. The authors state that ‘in evangelical communities overseas, these traditions have played even more important roles’ (p. 25) … About eight such voices from the majority world appear in the bibliography, which is very extensive over 12 pages. Unfortunately, not all these authors are listed in the subject index, so it is difficult to find their voices quickly in the text.

**Cambridge University Press**: _Analgesia, anaesthesia and pregnancy: a practical guide_ (4th edn), by Róisín Montero et al. (2019, 546 pp, £54.99). Rev. by Paul Hawkins, _Journal of Perioperative Practice_ **30**(1–2), 2020.

I did use the index once (right at the start of reading the book), but ‘regional blocks’ (neuraxial blocks) didn’t have an allocated page number, so eventually I gave up, slightly confused. Admittedly this may just have been a publishing error, and as it’s probably only a one-off, I will use the index again.

**CRC Press**: _Regulatory toxicology_ (3rd edn), ed. by Shayne C. Gad (2019, 354 pp, $199.95). Rev. by Alan C. Katz, _International Journal of Toxicology_, **38**(5), 2019.

A key consideration in selection of a book for use as a reference text is the level of detail provided in the overall Index section. This book is somewhat disappointing in this regard. For example, significant coverage is appropriately devoted to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, particularly as a focal topic over several pages in chapter 2; however, this term is not found either by its full title or the abbreviated form in the Index at the back of the book.

**Deutsche Grammophon**: _Beethoven Complete Edition_ (booklet accompanying boxed set of CDs). Rev. by Peter Quantrill, _Gramophone_, February 2020.

\[The DG box has\] a baffling index to the discs which is organised by section rather than alphabetically, and listed by opus number (followed by WoO numbers, then Hess and so on), so the _Namensfeier_ Overture (sorry, _Zur Namensfeier_) appears under ‘Orchestral’, between the Eighth and Ninth symphonies, rather than with all the other overtures in the ‘Stage’ section, and the entry for _Leonore_ (Hess 109/110) is nowhere near _Fidelio_ (Op 72). The Warner Classic index is a model of lucidity by comparison.

**Oxford University Press**: _Delhi in transition, 1821 and beyond: Mirza Sangin Beg’s_ Sair-ul-Manazil (Persian), ed., trans. and ann. by Shama Mitra Chenoy (2018, xciv + 221 pp, £42.99). Rev. by K. C. Yadav, _Indian Historical Review_, 31 January 2020.

A more comprehensive index, I feel, might have added to its value further.

**Oxford University Press**: _Relic hunters: archaeology and the public in nineteenth-century America_, by James E. Snead (2018, 301 pp, $90). Rev. by Bernard K. Means, _North American Archaeologist_, **40**(3), 2019.

I found that the index was also not as detailed as I would have liked and found it weak on some of the main concepts presented by Snead.

**Reaktion**: _Radio: making waves in sound_, by Alasdair Pinkerton (2019, 240 pp, £18). Rev. by Libby Purves, _Times Literary Supplement_, 10 April 2020.

There is an enragingly shallow index: how can a British writer produce a book about radio without listing either Tony Hancock or Lord Haw-Haw?

**IB Tauris**: _The state of secrecy: spies and the media in Britain_, by Richard Norton-Taylor (2019, 352 pp, £20). Rev. by Neal Ascherson, _London Review of Books_, 2 April 2020.

_The State of Secrecy_ seems to have been written – or proofread – in some hurry. Words are missing, the index is scanty and the author is made to say things he can’t have meant (for instance, that the Foreign Office feared that the Argentinian – he must mean British – claims to the Falklands were far weaker than publicly admitted).

## Indexes omitted

**Algonquin Press of Chapel Hill**: _Crossfire hurricane: inside Donald Trump’s war on the FBI_, by Josh Campbell (2019, 276 pp, $28.95). Rev. by Robert G. Kaiser, _New York Review of Books_, 27 February 2020.

Campbell’s _Crossfire Hurricane_ is an insider’s account (made less useful than it might have been by the publisher’s decision not to include an index).

**Artgraphic Cavin SA**: _The MIME Vademecum: mobility and inclusion in multilingual Europe_, ed. by F. Grin et al. (n.d., 192 pp, €36). Rev. by Greg Neidt, _Journal of Language and Social Psychology_, **38**(5–6), 2019.

One small flaw is the lack of an index for terms and ideas that recur throughout the text; readers must rely on the somewhat general question headers to find information about a topic they may be particularly interested in.

**Bloomsbury Publishing**: _One of them: from Albert Square to Parliament Square_, by Michael Cashman (2020, 432 pp, £18.99). Rev. by Gregory Woods, [https://tinyurl.com/rwtm4sg](https://tinyurl.com/rwtm4sg) (Facebook), 28 February 2020.

… for all its reference to public life and high levels of celebrity, this is not history: it’s a personal memoir and suffers some of the drawbacks of the genre (including the lack of an index).

**Fourth Estate**: _One two three four: the Beatles in time_, by Craig Brown (2020, 656 pp, £20). Rev. by Anthony Quinn, _The Observer_, 12 April 2020.

_One Two Three Four_ hasn’t the authority or the insight of Ian MacDonald’s sacred _Revolution in the Head_, and lacking an index it isn’t as useful as Philip Norman’s 1981 biography _Shout!_.

**Golden House Publications**: _Labour organisation in Middle Kingdom Egypt_, by Micòl Di Teodoro (2018, 210 + xviii pp, £60). Rev. by Petra Andrássy, _Journal of Egyptian Archaeology_, **105**(2), 21 April 2020.

An index would have further enhanced the user-friendliness of the text.

**Naval War College Press**: _New interpretations in naval history: selected papers from the Eighteenth McMullan Naval History Symposium held at the U.S. Naval Academy 19–20 September 2013_, ed. by Lori Lyn Bogle and James C. Rentfrow (2018, xii + 278 pp, $45). Rev. by John Beeler, _International Journal of Maritime History_, **31**(3), 2019.

The lack of an index, while common to such collections, is nonetheless a drawback in a book unlikely to be read from cover-to-cover by most who consult it.

**Orbis**: _Spiritual letters_, by Sister Wendy Beckett (2019, 305 pp, $24). Rev. in _Julian’s Window_ (newsletter of the Order of Julian of Norwich), **12**(1), March 2020.

Almost all this excellent book lacks is a short index of names (of saints) and major themes, though some undated letters devoted to specific themes are so grouped at the end of the collection.

**Oxbow Publishing**: _The Romanesque abbey of St Peter at Gloucester_, by Carolyn Heighway and Richard Bryant, with Malcolm Thurlby (2019, 128 pp, £24.99). Rev. by Eric Fernie, _Current Archaeology_, March 2020.

There are also points for the publisher. Why are the chapters not numbered? Numerous references are printed in the body of the text, which can be distracting; and why is there no index? Given the focused and subdivided character of the text, this may not have been considered necessary, but it is an omission that Oxbow might wish to reconsider. These observations do not detract from the clarity and thoroughness of the book, though, which marks a significant advance in our understanding of the building.

**Springer**: _Arts-based methods in refugee research – creating sanctuary_, by Caroline Lenette (2019, xxv + 240 pp, £77.99). Rev. by Helen Kara, _Qualitative Social Work_, **19**(1).

I have one big criticism of this book, although it is not of the author or the text. There is no index. This makes the book difficult to use for reference. All academic books should have professionally constructed indexes, and these should be provided by the publishers. Too often, scholarly authors are expected to contribute their hard-earned cash, on top of all the time they spent writing a book, for an index – or to make an index themselves when they don’t have the necessary skills. If they are challenged on this, publishers often plead poverty. Lenette’s book is published by Springer Nature, a global multi-national corporation which made €1.64bn in 2017 (Schuetze, 2018a), offered shares worth up to €1.6bn when it went public in early 2018 (Schuetze, 2018b), and expected to pay its shareholders a dividend of €110m at the end of 2018 (Schuetze, 2018a). Was it unable to budget for a few hundred euros to index this excellent book? If so, in these days of self-publishing, it seems foolish to treat shareholders as more important than the authors, or the quality of the products, on which your profits depend.

**Springer**: _Simulating societal change: counterfactual modelling for social and policy inquiry_, by Peter Davis and Roy Lay-Yee (2019, 256 pp, £62.31). Rev. by Charles Crothers, _Journal of Sociology_, **55**(4), 2019.

On a practical note, a lack of an index hinders use of the book and the detailed tables in the appendices might have been better accessed via a downloadable file to reduce clutter.

**State University of New York Press**: _Our time at Foxhollow Farm: a Hudson valley family_, by David Byars (2016, 312 pp, $33.49). Rev. by Olivia Arnone, _Collections: A Journal for Museum and Archive Professionals_, **15**(4), 2019.

While the efforts in putting this book together were obviously an incredible and worthwhile endeavor, it seems like a missed opportunity in that it could serve as a more useful historical reference if it contained an index of subjects. The individuals represented in this book are largely of a particular social, political, and regional significance; however, with the exception of the family tree diagram in the book’s introduction which illustrates the immediate family members, the subjects (which in addition to human are geographical, historical, and architectural in nature) are unable to be referenced without reading through the entire book. The significant quantity of images and associated information makes reading through it all and keeping track a difficult endeavor, to say the least.

**Verso**: _Capital city: gentrification and the real estate state_, by Samuel Stein (2019, 202 pp, $17.95). Rev. by Dennis E. Gale, _Journal of Planning Education and Research_, 6 August 2019.

Finally, I was nonplussed to discover that _Capital City_ does not contain any tables or charts, nor any maps or illustrations, to clarify and reinforce the author’s narrative. Such routine forms of empirical evidence would have been a welcome complement to the book’s rather wordy composition. Although footnotes help, its lack of an index and a bibliography further detract from the book’s utility to scholars and students who wish to pursue specific subareas of inquiry.

**Westminster John Knox Press**: _Making faithful decisions at the end of life_, by Nancy J. Duff (2018, ix + 134 pp, $15). Rev. by Jeremy James, _Expository Times_, **131**(2), 2019.

A book of such weight should have an index.

## By the way…

**Picador**: _A place for everything: the curious history of alphabetical order_, by Judith Flanders (2020, 272 pp, £18.99). Rev. by Libby Purves, _The Times_, 25 January 2020.

… in 1425 a concordance in England, spookily prefiguring Google searches, affirmed … ‘that the cure is greatly assisted by tables and indexes in the order of the abc.’

After Gutenberg, printers understood the usefulness of the ABC. And once each book had at last got the same page numbers (impossible in the days of hand copying), thus was born, gradually, the index in which to this day politicians and their aides may nervously check in Waterstones’ memoir section whether they get a mention.

As C. S. Lewis observed: ‘Medieval man was not a dreamer … He was an organiser, a codifier, a builder of systems.’ He would, Lewis says, have loved the card index.

Rev. by James Waddell, _Times Literary Supplement_, 1 May 2020.

The gradual acceptance of alphabetical order was, Flanders reckons, evidence of a broader historical shift towards conceptual abstraction. As alphabetical writing detached letters from meaning, and alphabetical order detached books from the world they described, so it was with double-entry bookkeeping, accurate clocks and searchable library catalogues: debit and credit became abstracted from specific transactions, time from the sun and seasons, and books from particular rooms or shelves. At times, this narrative is presented slightly too teleologically, as a largely medieval shift. In fact, the question of whether language is innate or arbitrary, for example, has been perennial among philosophers since at least Plato’s Socratic dialogue on the ‘correctness of names’, written in the fifth century BC.

Nevertheless, it’s clear that, as the Middle Ages progressed, alphabetization became ‘an idea that was in the air’, cropping up in bitty form in different places at different times. It was helped along by new technologies. Alphabetizing a mass of material can take several drafts; the arrival of paper – much less expensive than calfskin parchment – made this possible. The printing press brought relatively stable book pagination, which in turn facilitated alphabetized indexes. Sixteenth-century joinery techniques enabled furniture-makers to create cabinets with enough small compartments to store documents alphabetically. Hooks, rods, wax tablets, linen bags, paper slips, cards, spikes, lever arches, telephone switchboards and lengths of string (the Latin word for which, filum, gives us the modern ‘file’) all have their place in this intertwined material and intellectual history.

… As a biblical concordance put it c.1425: ‘man’s mind, that is often robbed of the treasure of cunning by the enemy of science – that is, by forgetting – is greatly assisted by tables and indexes in the order of the a, b, c’. Archbishop Thomas Arundel of Canterbury justifies an alphabetical index for a Gospel commentary of 1375 on more urgent grounds: ‘out of pity for students whose overwork leads to sickness and death’. Some remained content with unwieldy systems. Robert Boyle, the seventeenth-century natural philosopher, labelled his notes with an anarchic combination of coloured strings, paper covers, letters and numerals, writing mnemonic verses to remember where everything was (alphabetical order was about the only system he didn’t try).
