**Focus on what is bothering you.**

- The situation is . . . (COMPLAIN, STATE FACTS, NOT FEELINGS.)
- What I’m most stressed about is . . . (ONE SIMPLE STATEMENT ABOUT ONE TOPIC.)

**Express anger (A+ Anger) to unlock the circuit.**

- I feel angry that . . .
- I can’t stand it that . . .
- I hate it that . . .
- (plus more anger until your mind shuts off for a moment – you’ve unlocked the circuit!)

**Feel your feelings (pause before and after each one).**

- I feel sad that . . .
- I feel afraid that . . .
- I feel guilty that . . .

**Discover the glitch so that you can deactivate it.**

- OF COURSE I would do that, because my unreasonable expectation is . . . I get my:
    
    - safety
    - love
    - comfort
    - pleasure
    - purpose
    - survival
    - existence
    - protection
    - power
    - nurturing
- from...
    

**Switch to a new circuit and lock it in.**

- SLOW – Negate the unreasonable expectation 3 times.
- RAMP UP – Ridicule the unreasonable expectation 3 times.
- JOY – State the reasonable expectation 3 times.
