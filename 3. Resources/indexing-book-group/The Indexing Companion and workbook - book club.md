Where might you seek ideas to help you in planning? 
-- from beekeepers who subscribe to the magazine
-- from the retired beekeepers who will be maintaining the index

What sections would you index, what content would you index from those sections, and how would you format the locators (page numbers)? 
Practical articles
Research updates
Letters to the editor

Depending on budget and space, probably not brief news or news about members; that's going to be most relevant when it happens, not a few years later. However, if the retired beekeepers were enthusiastic to index members, I might propose it anyway. 

Make a list of the resources you would need (hardware, software, human and other). 

Fields to be included: 
author
title
subjects
type (practical article vs research updates) 

Locator format: volume, issue, start page
