Dear Elizabeth,

  

I'm very pleased to welcome you to the Macrex Chat community! We  will look forward to seeing you at the chats whenever you can come! 

  

You should have just now gotten an invitation from Canvas; once you accept it and set up your login, you will be on the list for access and notifications! Every chat day you'll get a notification email and then a Canvas invite with the chat link.

  

I encourage you to bring all of your questions about Macrex and indexing in general, and just enjoy the community. We have a nice group of indexers with a great range of experience who love to talk about it all! We all learn from each other and no question is too small or basic.

  

Chats take place at:

  

Tuesdays

10:30 Pacific time

11:30 Mountain time

12:30 Central time

1:30 Eastern time

  

Fridays

1:30 Pacific time

2:30 Mountain time

3:30 Central time

4:30 Eastern time

  

You don't have to come to any particular chat, just show up when you want to.

  

I'm also getting you an invitation to our North American Macrex email list, which functions to answer questions and give support in between chats.

  

Please note that the full version of Macrex is now free, with a voluntary donation to cover the cost of the web site with any excess going to the Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Association. Paypal address for donations is [macrex@macrex.myzen.co.uk](mailto:macrex@macrex.myzen.co.uk). This shift has happened because the Macrex community tragically lost both of our main tech support people in 2021: Drusilla Calvert to PSPA and Gale Rhoades to cancer. Therefore, though our programmer Hilary Calvert will still support the program, he is unable to offer the same response times as previously. There is still lots of support for Macrex; see below for resources.

  

--Chat members also have access to shared folders in Evernote with a lot of information compiled by Gale Rhoades and users on Macrex and general technology. Please let me know if you'd like an invite to those folders. (Evernote is free and quite easy to use.)

  

--Check out the Mastering Macrex videos on Youtube, [https://www.youtube.com/user/MacrexNA](https://www.youtube.com/user/MacrexNA).

  

--ASI webinar "Making the Most of Macrex" available from ASI website.

  

--Do Mi Stauber is available for North American support, including initial acquisition and setup. Contact her at [dmstauber@gmail.com](mailto:dmstauber@gmail.com).

  

Hope to see you soon!

  

****If you don't get your Canvas invitation, you can always use this link to find the Macrex chat! Or you can simply go to [www.canvas.instructure.com](http://www.canvas.instructure.com/), log in, and find it that way.
