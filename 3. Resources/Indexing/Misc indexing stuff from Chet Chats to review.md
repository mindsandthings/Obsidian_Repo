Deanta alone is almost enough to keep full-time indexing going.

The packager that sends me all the Routledge books.

The business plan for Oxford and Cambridge is to make as much money as possible with outsourced packagers, embedding, etc. and selling their handbooks to univ. libraries who have them on automatic ordering.

[13:49] Elena Gwynne: I've done a lot of work for packagers over the last few years - see every reference to Routledge in these chats :), and it's been really good for consistent, regularly paying work, but I'll also say that it hasn't been the greatest per-page rate, and I'm finally starting to think about phasing them out.

[13:54] Do Mi Stauber: Really, Doug? I encourage you to try. I am getting $7.75 (mostly from authors, through Columbia, UCal, Cornell, Duke, etc.)
[13:54] Elena Gwynne: For the first time in a while, I've got a book that I can easily hit the ten pages an hour mark on - provided I don't have any distractions :)
[13:54] Do Mi Stauber: Excellent, Elena!
[13:55] Elena Gwynne: I've started asking $5 a page more often.
[13:55] Amber DeDerick: I get $6-$7 per page. Appropriate for my level of expertise.
[13:55] Elena Gwynne: And once (but only once so far) $6 (and I got it).

[13:49] Do Mi Stauber: I very often find myself going back for something that only coalesced into a "thing" partway through the book. I stick a note right in my index file to search or check back for it.

[10:27] Elena Gwynne: I had the requisite piano lessons as a kid, but I didn't really enjoy it and nothing stuck.
[10:27] Amber DeDerick: I took to theater in high school. That was great fun and a large commitment on it's own.
[10:29] Elena Gwynne: Homeschooled, so I don't have quite the same set of experiences - the local homeschoolers did arrange several sets of workshops through Bard on the Beach though (same sort of things as their summer camp workshops).
