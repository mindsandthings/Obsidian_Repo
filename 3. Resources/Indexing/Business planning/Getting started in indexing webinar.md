### Session I “Getting Ready to Get Busy” covers

- **Equipment:** Choose your office setup and equipment for maximum efficiency
    
    - Whiteboard with next few months calendar on it - so you can see your schedule at a glance
- **Record-keeping:** Establish record keeping that is manageable and trouble-free
    
    - Work-Time Log (so you can calculate your hourly rate)
    - Invoice (with date sent out) - keep track of what you index and how (incl any front or back matter)
    - Query log (your responses to queries you've received)
        - Job offers you accept, decline, or don't get
        - Name of contact, email address and phone number
        - Delivery date of manuscript and number of pages
        - Due date of index
        - Fee you quoted
        - Source (you can save your emails just as you would any other document)
    - List of publishers you've worked for
    - List of books you've indexed
- **Marketing plan:** Create your marketing plan; identify your best target
    
- **Fees:** Develop fees that are fair, fitting the market and your skill level
    
- **Agreements:** Standardize indexing agreements so you don't rewrite them for every client
    
    - Has a sample indexing agreement in handout - check ASI website to see if there are updates (for with individual authors. publishing companies generally have their own)
        - You want the contract to be governed by the state in which YOU live
    - Specification
- **Resume**
     See sample in handouts
     What to include when you have no experience:
    – Description of what you have done professionally in lieu of indexing experience
    – Subjects of books you have indexed or would like to index
    – Training and education in indexing and related fields
    – Professional affiliations
    – Committees you’ve served on/offices you’ve held in ASI chapter
    – Published articles on indexing
    – Published articles on related subjects
    – Other ideas?
    
    - \[I should include what courses I've taken\]
- **Fees**
    Nothing is set in stone. Ask for a sample chapter of the manuscript from mid-book. Your bid may vary by:
     Average number of entries per page
     How well the book is organized
     Size of print
     Amount of illustrative matter
     Footnotes, end notes, references included?
     Overall level of difficulty
     Your desire to get the job...or not!
    BUT—THINGS MAY BE MOVING TOO QUICKLY FOR THIS APPROACH! **\[as in: you may lose the job if you take too much time assessing. authors also shop around a lot and just take the lowest bid.\]**
    Fees
    Set by publisher OR negotiable \[check ASI for updated rates\]
    – $2.25 to $3.50/page for general trade books
    – $3.75 to $4.25 for academic/scholarly books
    – $4.50 and up for highly technical scientific books
    – $5.00 and up for medical and legal
    – Double for embedded indexes
    
- Say amount of time included for corrections
    

If you have problems getting paid, you can withhold the copyright, but there's basically nothing you can do; you'd need a lawyer to sue and it will probably cost way more than the fee.

She will usually as for at least a $200 deposit, or even half.

https://idg.groups.io/g/main/message/29953 "I ask for deposits only from authors. Especially self-publishing authors. With publishers and packagers, I have some leverage; I retain copyright on the index until I’m paid in full."

 How? Use a spiral notebook with a vertical perforation
 Record name of publishing company, contact name,
phone number, and email address
 One publisher per page
 Record date and time of call(s) and results
 When you score a success or a dead end, tear out
that page and file it alphabetically in a 3-ring binder
 If you’re really fastidious, use an Excel spreadsheet

Contacting Publishers
By Phone
Call directly if you have the person’s name:
“May I please speak to Mary Osborne, your chief index arranger?”
OR
“Could you please tell me who handles the indexing of nonfiction books at Big Bug Publishing?”
OR
“Who is your Editorial Director/Assistant Editor/ Production Manager/Production Assistant?
Could you please connect me?

Phone Script

with person who handles indexing

• “Hello! My name is June Bug. I’m a freelance indexer,

and I’m calling to ask if you use freelancers to index your

nonfiction books.”

• “No, I’m sorry. We have our own indexers on staff.”

• “No problem. Perhaps you might have a friend in the

publishing business who could use my service. May I

send you a bookmark with my contact information in the

mail?”

• “Sure!”

• “Thanks!

Phone Script
with person who handles indexing
• “Hello! My name is June Bug. I’m a freelance indexer,
and I’m calling to ask if you use freelancers to index your
nonfiction books.”
• “I’ve got a pretty full list right now; don’t need any more.”
• “I understand. May I send you my credentials anyway?
You never know when a need might arise.”
• “Sure!”
• “Thanks! If you’ll just give me your email address...”

Phone Script
with person who handles indexing
• “Hello! My name is June Bug. I’m a freelance indexer,
and I’m calling to ask if you use freelancers to index your
nonfiction books.”
• “ Sometimes.”
• “May I tell you a little about myself and my indexing service?”
• “Hmmm--okay.”
• One or two sentences (no more!) to sell yourself.
– I’ve completed the U of California at Berkeley indexing course, a very respected
standard in the industry. I belong to the American Society for Indexing, and the
most recent book I indexed was_____________for XYZ Publishers.”
• “I notice on your website you publish xxx kind of books. That’s right
up my alley. If you give me your email address, I’ll send you my
credentials. And thanks!”

Phone Script
with person who handles indexing
• “Hello! My name is June Bug. I’m a freelance indexer,
and I’m calling to ask if you use freelancers to index your
nonfiction books.”
• “As a matter of fact, we do.”
• “That’s wonderful! I’d be happy to send you my credentials. Would
you prefer to receive them by email or regular mail?”
• They’ll say one or the other, most likely email.
• “Okay, great. What would you like me to send you?”
• “Oh, maybe a resume, a list of publishers you’ve worked for, and a
list of books you’ve indexed. Oh, and how about a sample index.”
• “Terrific! If you give me your email address, ’ll get right on it.”

Contacting Publishers
By Phone
Don’t bother leaving a message – they’ll never call back.
Keep calling until you speak to the right person.
A warm phone call to the right person
is the very best result.
Get their name and email address!
It is often tedious and frustrating.
Don’t give up! (Don’t be a nuisance, either.)

Contacting Publishers
By email
 Only if you have a direct email address of a good
suspect.
info@bigbugpub.com is almost always a dead end.
 Sending bulk email is very efficient
No more than 10 at a time to avoid appearance of spam
– But it eliminates the personal greeting
– Use BCC – please - so it won’t look like farming

Email Query to Publisher
I would like to offer you my services as a freelance indexer for your nonfiction books. As a
member of the American Society for Indexing, my rates are competitive and I honor my
deadlines. (If you have relevant background, insert it here.)
I work entirely via email, using PDF files of the final typeset manuscript, and return the index to
you in MS Word format.
If you could use another freelance indexer on your team, I’d be delighted to join you.
I invite you to visit my website http://allskyindexing.com , where you’ll find more information
about my services.
If you are not the person who handles indexing, would you please forward this message to that

Response to E-mail Query from Publisher
Thank you very much for inquiring about my services as a freelance
indexer.
I would be happy to evaluate your project and give you a price estimate. In
order to do so, I will need you to email me a typical chapter (at least 10
pages) from the middle of your manuscript. Charges are based on the
number of indexable pages, as well as the complexity of the work.
I will also need to know your time frame for completion of the index, to
make sure that my schedule is open during that time.
If you decide to proceed, I will send you an Indexing Agreement that will
clarify our mutual responsibilities. I‘ve found that a written agreement is of
benefit to both parties \[if working directly for an author\].
I look forward to your response, and I invite you to call me with any
questions about indexing that you would like to discuss.
Sincerely

Or Shoot from the Hip
The times they are a-changing’ and you may
have to act fast. Often the first person with a
professional response gets the job these days.
 So check your email often during the day.
 Be mindful of time zones.

Book Packagers
 Do the many jobs a publishers wants to farm out,
including (often) indexing.
 Not available via Writer’s Market, etc.
 Search for book packagers on the Internet
 Contact them as you would publishers.
 Tend to pay less.
 Work for many publishers so can be good source
of continuous ongoing work.
 Many of them are in India.

Contact Former/Not Yet Customers
Work is slowing down and you’d like more business?
 Go back through your list of completed jobs and
email publishers you haven’t heard from for a while.
 Go back to your spiral prospecting notebook and call
or email a few you never managed to connect with
last time around.
 You may shake something loose!

Getting in Front of Authors
 Publishing business has changed since 2008
 Publishers now very often give authors
responsibility for the index
– Do it yourself or hire someone – they don’t care
 Best bet: get on a publisher’s list of
recommended indexers, but be prepared to
compete.

How to Get in Front of Authors
 Join websites or blogs that cater to authors
and editors
 Join writing organizations
 Social networking
 ???

Social Networking
Linked In
– LinkedIn for Dummies book – learn how to use it
– Add all your Outlook contacts to LinkedIn
– Google “LinkedIn tutorial” to learn how
– Invite editor/publisher/author to join your network after you
finish the index
– Every time you finish a book, put out an update about
something you learned from reading it
– Ask for feedback from customers and publish it
– Your updates will go to your network and they’ll think of you.
– Their updates may remind you of someone you haven’t
contacted in while

Social Networking
Rules of the game:
 Be thoughtful
 Be active
 Be relevant
 Be genuine
 Don’t be boring or repetitive or proselytizing
 Don’t be inappropriately self-promoting
 Keep it clean

Social Networking
 Facebook
 Twitter
 YouTube
 Flickr
 Google+
 Wordpress
 Blogging

Buff Up Your Confidence
 Join Index Peers via Yahoo Groups
 Join or create an Index Peers group in your
area
 Do a practice index on a published book
 Read the classic books on indexing
 Visualize situations in which a publisher
might hire you regardless of your lack of
experience. And keep visualizing them

Why Might Someone Hire You?
 Current best indexer
– is suddenly swamped with work
– gets married to a rich person or goes on maternity leave
– gets promoted, gets a better job elsewhere
– goes back to school or retires
– turns in unsatisfactory work or misses deadlines
 Publisher has sudden unexpected flood of books
 New editor or production manager has no loyalty to
current indexers
 You have the requisite expertise in the book’s
subject.

Peer Critique
Participate in IndexPeers@yahoogroups.com
You will learn a great deal having your indexes
critiqued, as well as from critiquing others’
indexes, especially if they will share with you the
corrections others have made.
Start or join a Peer Review group in your area.

Get Active and Volunteer
 Volunteer in your local ASI chapter. You’ll
meet wonderful people, learn lots of good
things, and get great bragging rights, even if
you’re brand new.
 And...you may get business from your fellow
members when they have overflow.
 Looks good on your resume and website

Resources
 Buy and read the available books on indexing. But
not all at once.
 Do Mi Stauber’s Facing the Text is particularly useful
and enlightening.
 ASI Publications of all sorts, including the three on
Getting Started:
Marketing Your Indexing Services - new
Running an Indexing Business
Starting an Indexing Business,
Read and keep “Key Words” - lots of great
articles that mean more as you progress

Contacting Publishers

 5 contacts/day every business day for a month = 100 contacts \[a contact is the name and email address of the person who handles indexing. then the goal is to get on their list of recommended indexers to hand out to authors\]

 If your success rate is one in 20 contacts, you’ll have 5 new jobs by the end of the month.

 5 contacts a day (including record keeping and followup) is a full morning’s work.

 Even if you only make one new contact a day, at that rate you’ll have a new job by the end of the month

Put on degrees

"I offer my services to..."

Subjects of Books Indexed (or Desired)

Academic books

Writing

Psychology

Disability

Health & Wellness

I will need to do a survey of interesting nonfiction books I've bought or read and could see myself indexing, to see who published them. I should also look for small press nonfiction disability/health publishers.

Maybe I could look at autistic nonfiction books and see if they have indexes.

A lot of packagers are in India and pay poorly

will need to review ASI members' websites

network with other indexers
