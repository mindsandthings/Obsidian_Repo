# Intermediateâ€“Advanced Workshop - Sherry Smith Indexing

> ## Excerpt
> For these workshops, students write an index for an assigned book. During the workshop, we will discuss and compare those indexes. The discussion will focus on the primary principles of indexing and how those are handled in your document.    



Specifically, these issues will be....


...making decisions about readers


...defining the metatopic


...analyzing the text


...capturing the aboutness


...determining the appropriate level of detail


...gathering scattered and similar information


...remaining consistent with depth, structure and wording


...providing multiple access routes


...phrasing entries for brevity and usefulness



The group will be small so that everyone has an opportunity to talk and to share their indexing decisions. 
For more information about workshop schedules and other details, 
contact Sherry at indexer@sherrysmithindexing.com

(No workshops are currently scheduled.)
