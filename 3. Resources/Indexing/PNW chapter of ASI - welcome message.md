Welcome to the Pacific Northwest Chapter of ASI!

As the Membership Coordinator, I want to welcome you and make sure you’re aware of indexing activities in the Pacific Northwest.

We normally have conferences each fall.  The conferences are small and friendly, and it’s a good way to get to know some other indexers and start networking in a low-key environment.  Hopefully you can join us this fall for our remote conference, which was just announced and will be September 24: https://pnwasi.org/wp/?page_id=106

If you haven’t already, I’d suggest subscribing to our regional PNW listserve.  Go to the “Contact Us” tab on our Chapter web site http://www.pnwasi.org/  for a link.

There are normally regular informal Peer Review meetings or get-togethers in several cities.  Post to the listserv to find information about peer review near you.  Peer Reviews by more experienced indexers are an excellent way to improve your indexing skills.  You can find the links to this information on our web site under “Informal Meetings.”  Hopefully these will resume post-covid.

If you'd like to be included in the Chapter's online Directory, here are instructions:

· Look at the current directory:  https://pnwasi.org/wp/?page_id=81  Everyone has the same format.  Please see Sam’s listing, the first one, as an example.

· Everyone is allowed to have up to 10 areas of expertise listed, such as content areas or language abilities.  These are listed alphabetically after each person’s listing, and a client looking for a particular topic can use control-find to look for a certain word on the page, or scan through to find people that would be appropriate.

· Go to the Application page for instructions to create your directory listing: https://pnwasi.org/wp/?page_id=210

If you’re interested in hearing from indexers on a larger scale, there are numerous Special Interest Group (SIG) listservs which are listed on the national American Society of Indexers web site http://www.asindexing.org/chapters-and-sigs/special-interest-groups-2/

And of course if you have any questions, or would like more information, please feel free to contact me anytime.   

Maria
