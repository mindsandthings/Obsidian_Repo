## Module 1.5: Getting Work

And that brings us to the subject of getting work. Is there enough work for indexers to make a living? The [United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  (Links to an external site.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Books_published_per_country_per_year)and the [International Publishers Association (IPA) (Links to an external site.)](http://www.internationalpublishers.org/images/annual-reports/ipa_ar_online.pdf) both annually report on the number of books published per country. According to these reports, the United States alone consistently publishes over 300,000 books annually.

Not all books, fiction books for example, have indexes, but there are enough that do to keep working indexers very busy. There are many factors that play into how much work an indexer gets and the book market is only one of them. Additional issues are an indexer’s business skills, their ability to market themselves, and of course, how skilled they are at indexing.

The publishing industry has gone through tremendous changes and many of these changes have directly impacted indexers. For example, a number of major publishers have moved operations to India and other countries. It is not uncommon for US indexers to be hired by editors living half-way around the world just as often as by state-side editors.

Indexers are hired by publishing companies, packagers, and self-publishing authors. They can also be hired by journals, corporations, and nonprofits. In case you are wondering what a [packager (Links to an external site.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_packaging.) is—publishers can outsource book production to a company, or packager, which will provide editing, proofing, indexing, and even printing services.

Index fees have also experienced some changes over the years. The most typical way for an indexer to be paid is a per page fee. That refers to a dollar amount paid for each indexable page of the text and doesn’t include either front or back matter pages not generally included in the index. A per page fee is differentiated by the type of text. In the early 1990s, a $2.50/page was a pretty reasonable fee but most of those same publishers have raised their rates over the years. Currently, a per page range might be from a low of $3.00/page, for a simple text, to $5.00/page or more depending on the level of difficulty.

That said, there can be considerable variation in the dollar amounts paid by different publishers, packagers, and even firms offering editorial services. For example, some indexers have reported being offered extremely low fees (i.e. $1.50/page for challenging scholarly indexing) instead of more realistic fees that are proportionate to the amount of work involved (i.e. $4.00/page and higher). For example, I recently saw a request for experienced editors, put out by an editorial services firm, stating that their indexers are paid $4.20/1,000 words. This may initially appear to be a reasonable offer but, when one considers that there are an average of 250 words in a single page proof, the offered pay rate is actually a dismal $1.05/page. (Please note that a page word count can vary so I have selected the most typical page word count for the purpose of this example). There will always be those who try to pay indexers as little as possible and learning to be selective about clients is an important business skill for indexers to develop. Fortunately, there are more than enough publishers and packagers offering competitive indexing fees to keep indexers as busy as they want to be. 

Another type of fee is the per entry fee which refers to a dollar amount paid for each entry of the index.

A typical per entry fee might range from $0.70 to $0.80/entry. Occasionally, though relatively rare in the US, indexers will be paid by the hour. A per page fee is generally preferred by indexers and actually benefits clients as well because there will be clear expectations regarding how much a specific indexing project will cost the client.

Freelance indexers, operating as independent contractors, are responsible for paying their own US Social Security tax (or comparable tax depending on your country) including the matching portion usually paid by employers. There are no health insurance or vacation benefits. And, of course, indexers are responsible for their computer and software expenses as well as all other overhead expenses.

On the plus side: there is no commute, no office politics, no meetings, and you can work in your pajamas if you so choose. An indexer’s hours are flexible, allowing them to work at whatever time and schedule they choose as long as they are still able to make their deadlines. Indexers don’t get paid if they don’t work but—they can also take a day off to visit the zoo or go to the beach whenever they’d like.

So you may be wondering, can an indexer make a living? And the answer is yes, there is certainly a potential depending on how much you are willing to work and how savvy your business decisions are. Your client base, in turn, will largely be determined by how successful you are at marketing your indexing services.

There are no accurate figures on how many indexers are actively working, but we know that the number is low, not even enough for the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to list as a job category. In addition, since there is no certification or professional membership required to work as an indexer, there are no means of accurately reporting the number of indexers. 

I don’t know many indexers who enjoy marketing but it is a necessary evil unless you already have contacts in the publishing world you can count on to give you indexing work. You won’t necessarily have to market during your entire career, but you may have to initially engage in marketing in order to build a client list. The Internet has actually made marketing for indexers easier than ever with all of the online resources now available. ==For example, [The Literary MarketPlace (Links to an external site.)](http://www.literarymarketplace.com/lmp/us/index_us.asp) is a database on the publishing industry. An annual membership ($399.50/year) permits unlimited access to this database. Though, for a very reasonable $24.95, a one-week membership allows the same access and is plenty of time to collect information on hundreds of publishers.== There is enough information to narrow down publishers by the type and number of books they publish every year.

==The next marketing step is to match your work and educational experience to the type of subject-matter published by a particular publisher. Leveraging your expertise is an excellent way to make you attractive to a particular publisher.== I once had a student who had worked for over fifteen years for a nationally known environmental group. After completing her indexing training she approached a publisher specializing in books on the environment. She was able to leverage her work experience and received her first indexing projects from that publisher. Once she had completed several of those projects she was able to then approach other publishers and successfully launched her indexing career.

I can’t think of many people who don’t have expertise in something. And that something is always going to be a topic written about and published by a publisher somewhere. Matching your expertise to a company publishing in that same area will make your marketing efforts focused and therefore more effective.

So just how many clients do you need? ==When I was first starting out as an indexer, I was told by a more experienced indexer that a client base of at least seven clients is necessary to work as a full-time indexer. By that she meant seven publishing clients who might have several editors who will send you indexing projects. Each editor may send you only one or a just a handful of projects annually but that kind of client base will be enough to provide an indexer with full-time work.

The phenomenon of self-publishing authors has introduced a whole new aspect of marketing. There are a lot of indexers who connect with authors through LinkedIn and other social media. There may not be much repeat work available from a self-published author, but these kinds of projects can be a rewarding experience for the indexer.

 One last word about marketing—offering your indexing services is not something you should engage in until you have learned to competently write indexes.
