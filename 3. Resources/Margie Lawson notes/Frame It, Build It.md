Frame It, Build It
For Immersion-Grads only. 
Please do not share Frame It, Build It with other writers.
My Frame It, Build It System helps writers vault the challenge-to-write-fresh block. 
Frame It, Build It!
1.   Select an example of fresh writing.
2.   Analyze the structure. 
3.   Write down the FRAME of their sentence(s). 
4.   Use your words to build your fresh writing on that frame. 
Three Railroad Tracks to Infinity
1.   Facial Expressions -- Faces
2.   Dialogue Cues -- Voices
3.   Visceral Responses -- Viscerals
Feel free to jump the tracks two ways:
1.   If you get an idea that doesn’t follow the frame, great! Skip the frame.
2.   You can use any one of three railroad-tracks-to-infinity for a frame for one of the other two tracks.
It’s just a frame. Fill it in any way you like.
We do not use their words or phrases. 
We may use words like heart or stomach or voice, but not their special words or phrases.
