Dialogue Cues – Margie’s term. Dialogue cues share subtext. They deepen characterization. 
 
Dialogue cues describe how the words are delivered. They inform the reader how to interpret psychological nuances, the message behind the words.
 
Margie Identified Six Categories of Dialogue Cues:  TIP QVR
 
- Tone – angry, sarcastic, abrasive, fawning, cajoling, teasing Inflection – sing-song, drop or lift at end of words or sentences
- Pitch – high, low
- Quality – nasal, squeaky, reedy, enunciates or slurs words
- Volume – soft, loud, whispered, yelled
- Rate  – a breathy rush, pressured speech, long pauses 
 
All dialogue cues fall in one or more of those six categories. 
 
If what you wrote doesn’t fall in one of those categories, it’s not a DC.
Treat dialogue cues like facial expressions. USE THEM AS OFTEN… 
Amplify them when you need more subtext. 
 
Star-Crossed, Pintip Dunn, Immersion Grad, RITA Winner, NYT Bestseller
 
1. Will I ever get used to that voice? Deep and smooth, like a stone that’s been polished round by the current of a river.
 
2. My voice is so small it could hide between the tongue and grooves of the floor.
 
3. The tone—accusatory and disappointed—is more familiar, but I have no idea what 
she’s talking about.
 
4. My voice cracks, and I hate the tone, hate the pitch, hate my vulnerability. 
 
5. My voice is a pebble in an infinitely expanding universe. 
 
6. His voice is too complex, too layered with emotion for a simple reminiscence. All of a sudden, I know.
 
 
 
7. I force my voice sun-lamp-bright, as if that alone can combat my creeping sense of unease.
 
9. “I have a confession to make,” Master Somjing says, his tone changing. Without the stiffness shoring up each syllable, he sounds like a completely different person.
 
10. I make my tone light, as though my best friend’s anger doesn’t bother me.
 
The Ones We Trust, Kimberly Belle, 5-time Immersion Grad, International Bestseller
 
He’s taking care to keep his tone flippant, but I can hear something darker pushing up from under the words, something much more honest and true, as if maybe he’s testing the waters, checking how I will respond.

The Marriage Lie, Kimberly Belle, 5-time Immersion Grad, International Bestseller
 
1. “Don’t you want to get that?” Claire’s voice is high and girlish, and it slices through the silence like a serrated knife.
 
2. I scream back, the words fueled by fury and frustration.
 
 
3. Her speech is slow and syrupy, and I'm pretty sure she's stoned.
 
4. "Of course, you have no idea." His words agree, but not his tone. His tone says that I know where the money is, and he'll make good on his threat if he has to.
 
5.  There's pity in her voice now, and I can't listen to it for another second. 
 
 
 
Like Father Not Son, Kristin Meachem, 3-time Immersion-Grad
 
1.     “I didn’t see your mother at the church.” Jen’s words are sharp enough to cut and disembowel.
 
2.    “What do we do now?” Tom’s voice teeters on the edge of tough and frail, unsure which way to fall.
 
3.     “Good to know. You’re fine.” There’s as much concern in my voice as a nurse finishing a twelve-hour shift.
 
4.    "Good for you." Her words give me a standing ovation, but her tone says I'm a full-sized prick.
 
5.     “This isn’t about permission. This is about Tom’s happiness.” She coiled her tongue around the last ss’ and spit them out with the aggression of a cornered snake.
 
Trust Me, Romily Bernard, Margie-Grad
 
1.    The statements should sound accusatory—at least hateful—but Hart’s tone wobbles between guidance-counselor understanding and . . . just plain proud. 
 
2.    I can barely hear Lily now. She’s whispering softer than I am, probably close to tears, and I should try for comforting, but I’m barely holding down a scream.
 
3.    “You’re checking my stuff?” I ask, and I sound good. I’m all light and unimpressed even though my insides are splintering. 
 
4.    In the dark it’s easier to say what I mean. My voice is climbing and I’m struggling  to make it stop.
 
5.    Bren’s voice is scratched and frayed, just like everything between us now.
 
6.    Lily’s voice ratchets into something smaller again, more like my little sister and  less like the girl from seconds before. 
 
7.    Norcut’s voice is slippery and smooth. And satisfied.
 
8.    If there was regret in his voice before, it’s gone now. Excitement’s piling up the sentences and I know what’s coming next. Maybe because I always did. 
 
Loose Frame – Share what’s not in the voice CONTRASTED WITH (implied but) what’s there now.
 
COULD BE – expected the same TONE heard before – but now…
 
                        Hoped to hear a certain TONE, but now…
 
USE WITH FACES TOO!!!
 
The Last Breath, Kimberly Belle, 4-time Immersion-grad
 
1.    His accent was northern and nasal, but in Ella Mae’s ears sounded electric, exciting, exotic. “That’s not something we would’ve ever found back in Chicaaago.”
 
Visual Dialogue Cue – You don’t have to describe how it sounds.
 
2.    “Well, laa-tee-daa.” She stretches out her words, loads them up with an extra serving of Tennessee twang. “Don’t that sound fancy.”
 
3.    Ray grew about four inches in the wicker chair, and his tone took a turn for the nasty.
 
4.    Allison’s voice was quiet as ever, but for the first time, Ella Mae heard footprints of fire in her tone. 
        
5.  Her tone takes a serious turn, matching mine, and her voice and vowels
softening into the more generic timbre she perfected in college. Less country hick, more Southern belle. Unlike me, Lexi can turn her accent on and off like a faucet. 
 
 
Dialogue Tags are attributions. They attribute the line of dialogue to a character.
Categories of Dialogue Tags
Undesirable Tags: They share something about the voice, but they’re overused.
You’ll see undesirable attributions in most books, but they’re not your best choice.
 
Undesirable Tags:
 
1.    Adverbs — She said softly, sternly, sarcastically, emphatically
 
2. Words that end in ED — murmured, added, commanded, reported, hissed
 
Okay-If-Rarely-Used Tag: 
 
Basic Attributions — Say/said and ask/asked. Use RARELY, OR NOT AT ALL. If rarely used, they’re practically invisible on the page. But in the audiobook, said and asked can be a speed bump. It’s distracting. 
 
SAID and ASKED don’t share any subtext. That’s why they’re not your best choice.
 
Desirable Tags: 
 
2. Action Tags — Tags dialogue with MEANINGFUL action. Good to use some of the time. Doesn’t share anything about the voice.
 
3. Setting Tags — Tags dialogue by having the character use a prop or interact with the setting. Good to use some of the time. Doesn’t share anything about the voice.
 
4. Body Language Tags — Tags dialogue with body language like facial expressions or the use of spatial relationships. Great to use! 
 
5. Dialogue Cues — Describes the voice, how the words are delivered. 
Shares subtext. Yay!
 
Dialogue Cues inform the reader how to interpret the message behind the words. They share the psychological nuances.
 
Dialogue Cues fall in one or more of the six TIP QVR categories. Writers need to know which categories they use.

Beware of Undesirable Attributions
 
Attributions tag dialogue so the reader knows who is speaking.  
 
Dialogue cues (Margie’s term) tag who is speaking, but they also strengthen the read. They share tone, inflection, pitch, quality, volume, and rate. They’re written in a fresh way.
 
Here’s what James V. Smith, Jr. included in his basic how-to book, You Can Write a Novel.  
 
“You’re an animal,” she said.
 
“Am not,” he replied.
 
“Are too,” she countered.
 
“Oh, yeah?” he challenged.
 
“Yes. A pig,” she added.
 
“Am not,” he sneered.
 
“Are too,” she continued.
 
“A pig?” he grinned. “Really?”
 
“A fat pig,” she emphasized.
 
 
Here’s a starter list of 40 undesirable attributions. These all end in ED. But all forms of these words are undesirable as attributions.

Getting Subtext on the Pace:  Faces
 
You almost can’t have too much body language in your WIP. But you can have too much of the same, tired, we’ve-read-it-too-many-times facial expressions.
 
You don’t have to increase word count to increase interest and power.
 
Star-Crossed, Pintip Dunn, Immersion Grad, RITA Winner, NYT Bestseller
 
1.  Her eyes meet mine for a fraction of a second, and something I can’t read flits through them.  
 
2.  “If and when you become ruler, that decision will be yours to make,” my father says, his lips straight, his cheeks relaxed. I call it his “King face,” the one he wears when he wants to conceal his thoughts. 
 
3.  The corners of his lips twitch in a quarter smile, less serious than sad, more tired than anything else.
 
Less than, more than structure
 
4.  His face is tight, unreadable. A mask that hides his true feelings as effectively as a pie crust conceals the filling. 
 
5.  She’s only a few years older than me, and her eyes are kind, although she has the hardened features of all the colonists who work in close proximity to food. It’s as if steeling the soul against daily temptation sands the softness right off your face.
 
6.    Hope lights up her face, and then, like a flickering candle, it dies. 
 
7.    I look up, and the expression in his eyes makes me forget the loop, forget the council, forget the team.
 
The Butterfly Bride, Vanessa Riley, 6-time Immersion Grad
 
1.    Theodosia smiled her sweet smile, the one she used in her business meetings with greedy florists.
 
2.    This one smiled the way Lucy did when she mastered something new. 
 
3.    There was fear and guilt in his eyes, BUT none of the hope she’d seen at their wedding. 
 
She shared what was there and what wasn’t there – she expected to see hope
 
Could be same for DC – there was ___ and ___ in his tone, none of the ___ she expected to hear. 
 
 
Find Me, Romily Bernard, Margie Grad, Golden Heart Winner
 
            1. Blast me with a Care Bear stare. 
2. Her eyes slide smoothly over me as if they were always on their way back to Todd.
 
3. Everyone else is talking and crying, but Tally’s motionless, staring at me like I’m the only person who has ever mattered. Like I’m a hero. 
 
4. Her eyes meet mine again, and I’m suddenly struck by how flat they look, how empty…how familiar. Tally looks like one of my dad’s junkies, the one who went on a four-day bender, coming down so hard she doused herself with gasoline and struck a match. 
 
Ten Smiles from Find Me by Romily Bernard, Margie Grad, Golden Heart Winner
 
1. Then Carson’s smile drains like a wound. 
 
2. Carson’s lips go as thin as scars.
 
3. I had forgotten how pretty her mom is, how Mrs. Waye can cry and still keep her make-up perfect. But it cracks around her strung-up smile.
 
4. He’s in the dead center of the picture with a game-show-host smile.
 
5. Griff’s smile is lit-fuse bright.
 
6. Lauren leans in a little closer, and her innocent smile worms its way wide.
 
7. She gives me a small, shy, totally un-Bren-like smile. 
 
8. His smile is slow and secret, like I’m the only person left in the world.
 
9. Now I am suspicious. This has a Hallmark Very Special Moment feel about it.
 
10. Bren’s smile is so wide now I know it’s fake. I recognize the look. Her smile is just like my mom’s when she kept telling us everything was fine, just like my teachers’ when they said Lily and I would be okay. Bren stretches that smile until her eyes narrow.
 
Struck by Eros, Jenn Windrow, 4-time Immersion-Grad
 
1.    Grayson sat up and gave me the melt-your-heart smile that I’m sure made most women drop an egg.
 
2.    Len’s toothy smile reminded me of the day he surprised me with round-trip tickets to Pompeii, not the smile of someone who had figured out his girlfriend was a lying slut.
 
3. He gave me a killer smile that sent a bullet straight to my heart. 
 
 
Serena’s Fall, M.K. Smith, 7-time Immersion-Grad 
 
1.    Rachel tossed a vicious look that wouldn’t pass anyone’s test for a smile.
 
2.    She grinned like a little girl in a big girl’s body. 
 
3.  I lied with my voice and faked up a smile. “Sounds great.”
 
 
A School for Unusual Girls, Kathleen Baldwin, USA Today Bestseller
 
1.    They sat across from me, stone-faced and icy as the millpond in winter. Father did not so much as blink in my direction. But then, he seldom does.
 
2.     A flash of surprise lit her eyes but instantly vanished, followed by a frighteningly cold steel shuttering of her features. 
 
3.     I buckled my lips together and then promptly unbuckled them. 
 
4.     An emotion splashed across Jane’s face, but vanished so swiftly I couldn’t identify it. Was it anger? Sadness perhaps? Or pain?
 
5.    I tried not to cower under her predatory gaze. If this woman intended to be my jailer, I needed to stand my ground now or I would never fight my way out from under her thumb.
 
Kennedy Ryan, When You Are Mine, multi-Margie Grad, Immersion Grad
 
1.       Kerris’s smile played tug-of-war with her sad eyes.
 
2.       The smile Kerris pushed onto her lips felt like a too-tight sweater.
 
3.       Walsh lobbed a silent yes-get-me-out-of-this expression to his mother. She returned with a mama-always-knows smile.
 
Wild Women and the Blues, Denny Bryce, 7-time Immersion-Grad
 1.  Her expression was like the pages of the screenplay I never wrote. Blank with a heavy shot of I don’t care.
 
2. I inched forward. Not too far, but close enough for my head to spin. The small room with its dropped ceiling stoked my claustrophobia. No windows. No air. No natural light. Just stark-white walls out of focus like cheesecloth over a camera lens. 
This Heart of Mine, C.C. Hunter (Christy Craig), Immersion Grad, NYT Bestseller
1.    Dad walks over. He’s wearing his I’ll-take-on-the-world face. The expression he wore most of the time when I was sick.
 
2. What really catches my attention is what I don’t see. No pity. No pain. No grief.
 
3. I feel my smile slip from my eyes, my lips, and fall completely off my face. I know the look he sees in my eyes is probably the same pity-filled expression I saw in his seconds ago. 
 
4. And there’s nothing in his voice, his eyes, or his expression that says he’s lying. 
 
The Stranger, Harlan Coben, NYT Bestseller
 
1. He made a face of his own and did that teenage tumble-walk-clump down the stairs, as though some invisible hand pushed him from behind and his feet were trying to catch up.
 
AMPLIFY -- IMPRESS THE READER --
 
2.    “I opened the door with my key. I called out to Heidi—I knew she was home because her car was there. I walked into the den and…” Marty’s face twisted into something barely human and then collapsed into something all too human.
 
The Likeness, Tana French, NYT Bestseller
 
When we got out of the car I got my first real look at what Frank had meant about these four, how they came across to outsiders. As we walked down the long avenue between the sports fields something happened, a change as subtle and definite as water turning to ice:  they moved closer, shoulder to shoulder and in step, backs straightening, heads lifting, expressions falling away from their faces. By the time we reached the Arts block the façade was in place, a barricade so impenetrable you could almost see it, cool and glinting like a diamond.
