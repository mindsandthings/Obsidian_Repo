Digging Deep into Margie’s 20 Point Checklist for Openings
This checklist is for every scene and every chapter.
Use it for the opening of every scene and every chapter.
 
1. What hints do you have about your Story Promise in the first paragraph or two? 
 
n  Most books don’t have a HINT of their Story Promise in their first paragraph or two, but it’s waaaay cool when they do.
 
n  Here’s a big piece of a story promise from The Trouble with Twelfth Grave, Darynda Jones, 2-time Immersion Grad, NYT Bestseller.  
 
Being the only grim reaper this side of eternity, I didn’t scare easily, especially after getting an inquiry like the one I’d received from Mrs. Blomme.
 
Notes:  ________________________________________________________________
 
2. What is your Style Promise?  AUTHOR’S VOICE
 
Style Promise cues the reader regarding the author’s voice and writing style. It has nothing to do with the characters or the story.
 
Pretend you told a friend you just read a great book and they’ve got to read it. You told
them about the story, but they asked, “What’s the writing like?”
 
Your answer? The Style Promise.
  
Remember:  The Style Promise has nothing to do with the characters or the story.
 
 
n  Conversational? Downhome? Lyrical? Irreverent? Comedic? Lots of other styles.
 
Notes:  ________________________________________________________________
 
3. Did you orient the reader to Who and Where in your first paragraph?
 
WRITERS KNOW ALL – YOU’RE THE OZ FOR YOUR STORY.
 
YOU KNOW TOOOOOOO MUCH!
 
SHOW READER SETTING!
 
n  The reader almost always becomes the POV character. It’s critical for the reader to be locked in the POV character’s skin in the first paragraph.
n  The reader needs to know where they are, or their video has nothing on the stage around the character. No setting. They’ll just see a floating head.
 
Notes:  ________________________________________________________________
 
4. Did you include something unpredictable, maybe quirky, specific to the character on the first page? 
 
n  If possible, slip in something unpredictable, maybe quirky, about the character on your first page. Could be anything. Not required, but smart when it happens.
 
Notes:  ________________________________________________________________
 
5. If your book is comedic or paranormal, set in the past or future, set under the ocean or in another world, is there a hint on your first page? 
 
n  Provide the reader with a clue, so there’s no possibility of a speed bump later.
 
Notes:  ________________________________________________________________
 
6. Is the first line your POV character’s line? 
 
If you start with dialogue from a non-POV character, the reader will probably think that character is the POV character. 
      
Notes:  ________________________________________________________________
 
7. Do you have power words? Did you backload?
 
n  Power Words -- words that carry psychological power.
 
n  The more power words, the more power on the page.  
 
Notes:  ________________________________________________________________
 
8. Do you have themed words? Scene-, character-, or emotion-themed words?
 
n  Themed words carry subliminal power. 
 
n  Examples of themed words from Star-Crossed by Pintip Dunn.
 
-- I nod slowly, like a bot in need of oil.
 
-- My heart thumps so loudly as I walk down the corridor it could be a signal from Earth, the one for which our computers are constantly searching—and have yet to find. 
 
YOU CAN HAVE CLICHED VISCERALS – IF YOU AMPLIFY IN FRESH WAYS.
 
-- “I saw your mother.” My voice comes out excessively bright, like a spotlight on top of the sun lamps.
 
USE BACKSTORY SLIP-INS TO FRESHEN ANYTHING
 
Notes:  ________________________________________________________________
 
9. Do you have fresh writing? No clichés? No overused word pairings or phrases?
 
WATCHFUL EYE – VIGILANT EYE
 
n  Writing fresh is bestseller-smart.
 
Notes:  ________________________________________________________________
 
10. What visuals do you provide for the reader?
 
WHAT’S YOUR VISUAL?
 
n  Don’t just tell. Give the reader visuals for their video. 
 
Notes:  ________________________________________________________________
 
11. Do you have a compelling cadence?
 
n  A compelling cadence drives the reader through each sentence and paragraph and passage and page. Cadence helps make your book a page-turner. 
 
Notes:  ________________________________________________________________
 
12. Which rhetorical devices did you use? 
 
n  Use more than your go-to rhetorical devices.
 
n  Did you use any rhetorical device combos? 
Notes:  ________________________________________________________________
 
13. Do you have strong pacing? Did you avoid giving readers invitations to skim?
 
 Three Checks for Strong Pacing:
 
1.    Five D Decision Tree for YELLOW – You don’t know this yet, but you will!
2.    Strategic White Space
3.    Make a list of what the reader learns at the bottom of every page. 
Notes:  ________________________________________________________________
 
14. Did you slip in hits of backstory in compelling ways, including the sex of your POV character and their age or age range? 
 
n  Does it read like a chunk of backstory? Does it stop your story momentum?
 
n  Were you strategic about style and structure? RDs? Compelling Cadence?
 
 
I’ll share a passage that includes slipping in the POV character'age from Tempted, by Multi-Virtual Immersioner, Debbie Hope.
 
The Before:
 
The two men at the juke box turn to see us ogling them and walk over to us. I don’t know if my jaw hangs open like the waitress’ does. Hope not. 
 
Someone knowing that my father owns the team would think I’d be used to being around players, but I’ve only been to a few games. Dad never wanted me around the players.  Now it’s my turn. My turn to play if I want. 
 
“Sadey. There you are.” 
 
I recognize that squeaky voice.  
 
Now I remember why we lost touch. She’s fake. From her obvious boob job to her too puffy, red lips. 
The Deep Editing Process:

“Sadey. There you are.”
 
I recognize that squeaky voice. even so long after high school, eight years and several lifetimes ago. My almost-friend Mandy. Always on the fringes, usually looking for fringe benefits. Like jetting away for a long weekend in Cabo. 
 
“There you are. I was just about to leave.” 
 
“Leave?” A fake gasp escapes. 
 
Now I remember why we lost touch. She’s fake. From her obvious boob job to her too puffy, red lips.  
 
Rewrite of Last Paragraph:
 
Now I remember why we lost touch. She’s fake. From her too puffy, had-to-be-collagen lips to her obvious A to DDD boob job.

Notes:  ________________________________________________________________
 
15. Do you have the right balance of fresh writing and plain do-the-job-well writing?
 
n  There’s no perfect ratio. Some authors have little hits of fresh writing several times on most pages. Others have a lot less.
 
Notes:  ________________________________________________________________
 
16. If your previous chapter ended with a strong stimulus, did you share a hint about that stimulus in the opening of the next chapter? If you have alternating story lines, check alternate endings and openings.
 
n  Have you ever forgotten what was happening in a book that you had to stop reading for a while? You started reading the next chapter and felt lost. Had to flip back a page or two to get clued in.
 
n  Don’t write that book. Your readers will read your books straight through, or be obsessed with getting back to your story. 
 
n  But if life interferes, or their brain overloads, and the story thread unravels for them—you’ve reoriented them. Just in case. 
 
Notes:  ________________________________________________________________
 
17. Did you avoid writing things that annoy agents and editors and reviewers and Margie?  
 
n  Throw away words? Adverbs? Undesirable attributions? Yammering? Clichés? Overused word pairings? Too many gerunds? Other things?
Notes:  ________________________________________________________________
 
18. Did you deepen characterization on the first page? 
 
n  What quality about your POV character did you hint about or spotlight?
 
Notes:  ________________________________________________________________
 
19. Did you honor the POV character’s Emotional Set? Is it on the page?
 
n  You know the Emotional Set of your POV character. It’s more than their mood in the moment, much more. 
 
n  Ideally, their Emotional Set is on the first page. Then the reader knows it too.
 
Notes:  ________________________________________________________________
 
20. Do you have an NYT on page 1 or 2? How many pages into your story is your first NYT?
 
n  It may be a word, phrase, sentence, or paragraph. Something that’s special but isn’t a speed bump. It’s smooth and perfect and special-special.
