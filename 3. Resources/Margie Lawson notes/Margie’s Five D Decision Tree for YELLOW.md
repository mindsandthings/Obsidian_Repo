Margie’s Five D Decision Tree for YELLOW
 
Every time you see a sentence (or more) that would be EDITS SYSTEM YELLOW, ask yourself five questions.
 
1. Can I DELAY it? Share it later? 
Does the reader absolutely need to know this now?
2. Can I DELETE it?
3. Can I put it in DIALOGUE?
So much stronger to say than think.  Turn YELLOW into BLUE!
If there’s no reason not to have your POV character say it, have them say it!
4. Can I put it on a DIET? Tighten? 
5. Can I DEEP EDIT and add power?
 
It is a decision tree. Learn the five D’s in order.
 
1.    Delay
2.    Delete
3.    Dialogue
4.    Diet
5.    Deep Edit
 
HELLO:  You may keep your YELLOW as is. It may be perfect.
 
You need some YELLOW. You may do combinations. Sometimes you may do 2 and 3. Or you may do 2 and 4. Or – you may do 2, 3, and 4. Or…
 
Or you may notice you have several lines of YELLOW that you love, and need, but you practice creative paragraphing. You hit ENTER and add some white space.
 
You may break it up with another EDITS System color or two.
 
Why all this attention on EDITS System YELLOW?
 
If you have too much straight YELLOW that’s not POWER YELLOW, you have an invitation to skim. 
 
It needs to be POWER YELLOW. It needs to be loaded with power words. It needs to have plenty of white space. It needs to have an uber-compelling cadence. And it needs to make me smile.
 
That uber-compelling cadence may include some rhetorical devices.  Smart idea, right?

Since You’ve Been Gone, by Christa Allan, Multi-Margie Grad
 
Christa Allan writes not-your-typical inspirational stories. She refers to them as irreverent inspirationals. 
 
The Set Up:  
Wyatt should have been driving toward the church for their wedding. But when he wrecked his car and died, he was heading the opposite direction. Police officers just mentioned the baby gift found in Wyatt’s car. Olivia didn’t know about that gift, but the police tell her they told her parents about the gift.
Since You’ve Been Gone, by Christa Allan, the end of Chapter 6 
 
It wasn’t at all fair of me to blindside them, but they’d kept me blind for weeks. Just the picture of that gift sliced my heart open.
Who was this meant for? Wyatt, who the hell were you? How much about you didn’t I know?
Who could have guessed that the people I loved, who thought themselves so different from one another, ultimately became more alike?
My parents and Wyatt.
All three of them harbored secrets that were destroying my life.
 
 
 
 
Five Components of POWER YELLOW
 
1.    Power words?  Yes!
 
2. White space? Absolutely! 
 
Christa added more white space. She spotlighted the content. White space gives the content more emphasis, more impact.
 
3. Uber-compelling cadence? Yes. Powerful cadence.
 
4. Probably a rhetorical device, or two, or three. Not required. But probably…
