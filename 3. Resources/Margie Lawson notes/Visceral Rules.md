Visceral Rules: Beyond Hammering Hearts
 
Given that a story is strong and the characters are compelling, what could make the difference between a skimmer and a winner?
 
The incontrovertible visceral response.
Margie’s Criteria for a Visceral Response: 
1.     Emotionally triggered
2.     Immediate
3.     Involuntary – If it (what you think is a visceral response) can be done voluntarily at any time, it’s not a visceral response.
4.     Physical, needs to be anchored to the body
5.     Experienced by the POV character
A visceral response is an immediate, emotionally triggered, involuntary physical response anchored in the body experienced by the POV character.
 
Visceral responses are always immediate. An emotional stimulus presents, and a visceral response happens within a picosecond. Picoseconds are fast. Wicked fast. One-trillionith-of-a-second fast.
 
Margie’s Two Categories of Visceral Responses:  Papa and Baby
 
Papa Visceral Responses Include:
n adrenaline 
n stomach /nausea
n heart
n lungs
n paralysis
n vision
n hearing
n dizziness
 
Baby Visceral Responses Include:
n hands shaking, trembling
n legs weak
n legs shaking
n throat tight
n mouth dry
n heat on neck or face 
 
These are NOT VISCERAL RESPONSES. These are Instinctive Reactions:
o          clenching hands
o          gritting teeth
o          gasping
o          blinking
 
 
EDITS System Highlighting Papa and Baby Viscerals:
A papa visceral is always PINK.
 
A baby visceral is only PINK if a papa is reasonably close, within a page. A solo baby visceral is underlined RED and gets a PINK B in the margin.
 
Margie’s Top Twelve Visceral Rules:
 
1.   Visceral responses are involuntary. They cannot be controlled. 
2.   Avoid clichéd and overused visceral responses. 
3.   Beware of structural patterns. 
4.   Use deep editing techniques to strengthen visceral responses. 
5.   Assess your scenes and opt for baby or papa visceral responses.
6.   Know where to place your visceral responses. Use Motivation Reaction Units.
Dwight Swain – Techniques of the Selling Writer
Stimulus – Huge Emotional Component
Response – 3 Stages = MRUs – Follow the vertical order
1. Visceral Response --  HEART
2. Instinctive Reaction
3. Rational Thoughts, Dialogue, and/or Action – IN ANY ORDER, ALL, SOME, OR NONE
7.   Use a range of rhetorical devices, not just your go-to RDs. 
USE 18 OF 20 RDs. -- You don’t have to use Allusion or Eponym.
 
8.   Consider making some of your visceral responses themed.
9.   Thread emotion. Crescendo some visceral responses. 
10. Use advanced stimulus/response patterns:
-- Use a Dialogue Cue as a stimulus for a Visceral Response.
-- Use Body Language as a stimulus for a Visceral Response.
-- Use a Visceral Response as a stimulus for another Visceral Response.
11. If you heavily visceralize your POV character, consider a Visceral Recovery.
1. You don’t need to spotlight it. Great to use PLAIN WRITING for Visceral Recovery.
 
2. Not needed if scene or chapter ends. Still not needed if next scene/chapter is contiguous, reader will make up the character recovered.
 
3. Only need to have ONE visceral recovery – even if more visceral responses were in the paragraphs above. 
 
12. Use the Magnetic Train Cars Technique many times per book.
Analyze These Examples:
 
The Blade Itself, Marcus Sakey, NYT Bestseller
 
“I heard someone was asking about you.”
 
Old instincts tightened Danny’s skin. “Who’s that?”
 
Patrick looked up at him, the joking in his eyes replaced by something more serious, like he was watching for a reaction. “Evan McGann.”
 
Danny’s mouth went dry, and he felt that tingling in his chest, the sense of his heart beating hard enough to rattle his ribs. He scrambled for his game face, almost got it.
 
Magnetic Train Cars:
 
 
First Train Car:  Danny’s mouth went dry
Second Train Car:  and he felt that tingling in his chest 
Third Train Car:  the sense of his heart beating hard enough to rattle his ribs.
 
 
A Gift from Margie!  The Magnetic Train Technique: 
You can use two, maybe three, cliched viscerals in your magnetic train if:
1.    the third train car is longer
2.    the third train car is fresh or special in some way
3.    and the whole train is perfectly cadenced

1.    A jolt of something creepy shoots through me, knotting my shoulders,  wringing my stomach like a wet rag.

The Last Breath. Kimberly Belle, 5-time Immersion Grad, USA Today and Wall Street Journal Bestseller
 
 
 
1.    Her words zap me like a Taser, temporarily paralyzing my heart, my lungs, my conviction Lexi would do the right thing.
 
2.    I step closer to his bed, into his line of vision, an icy chill hijacking my spine.
 
3.    And then I remember something else. Something that shoots a shiver up my spine and slams my heart to a standstill.
 
 
 
One Night on the Virgin’s Terms, Melanie Milburne, 4-time Immersion Grad, USA Today Bestseller 
 
1.    Her skin was tight all over, her heart rate picking up, her senses on high alert.
 
2.    Her breath stalled, her heart tripped, her stomach flipped.
 
3.    She took a prickly breath, her heart thumping, her stomach bottoming out.
 
4.    She glanced at the CCTV monitor on the desk and her heart missed a beat—and then raced, as if it needed an emergency dose of beta blockers.
 
5.    His voice had a rusty edge that did strange swoopy things to her stomach.
 
Threaded Visceral:
 
Louis glanced at her mouth and her stomach swooped and dived again.
 
Letters to the Lost, Brigid Kemmerer, NYT Bestseller
 
1.    My chest tightens. Every breath is a struggle, and my throat doesn’t want to work right.
 
2.  Breath rushes in and out of my lungs like I’ve won a race.
Two paragraphs later, the visceral recovery:  
Eventually my breathing slows, but I can’t look at her. 
3. My pulse goes from sedentary to cardio in the span of one second.
 
Lies We Tell Ourselves, Amy Matayo
 
1.    Her words pinch a nerve somewhere around my stomach. It’s an old feeling, one I’ve dealt with for years. I don’t like it. 
 
IMPACT ON THE POV
 
OKAY to be VAGUE – VR, Faces, DC
                        
2.  When he smiles back at me, my pulse slows down like my heart might be looking for a way to survive. 
 
Race the Darkness, Abbie Roads, 4-time Immersion Grad
 
1.       His heart stopped. Adrenaline shot from his brain straight to his fist.
 
 
 
2.       Her heart sank down, down, down, until it rested on the pavement beneath the Miata.
 
3.    Fear plunged into his heart sharp as a scalpel.
 
I Wish You Happy, Kerry Anne King, Cruising Writers Grad, International Bestseller
 
1.    Her anxiety tightens my shoulders and quickens my breath. Her anger heats my blood.
 
2.    If she had superpowers I’d be on fire by now, the intensity of her gaze incinerating me from the inside out. My heart is beating way too fast, accelerating into warp drive. Everything else slows down. The houses, the pavement, the road ahead look flat as a painted canvas, stationary and unreal. 
 
Closer Home, Kerry Anne King, Cruising Writers Grad, International Bestseller
 
1.    My knees are wobbly, and an electric zing keeps running through the fingers of my left hand, a nervous buzz that always hits me when I’m wound up too tight.
 
2.    The hall seems to stretch, and it takes forever to reach the door and run outside. I feel like I’m underwater and starving for oxygen. When I finally 
manage to suck in a breath, it makes a whooping sound and gets tangled in my chest. 
 
Dirty Magic, Jaye Wells, 3-time Immersion Grad, USA Today Bestseller, Cruising Writers Grad
 
1.       I must have gasped because suddenly my lungs felt too full. 
 
2.    My stomach suddenly felt as if it took a nosedive off Bessemer Bridge.
 
 
 
Sweet On You, Laura Drake, RITA Winner, 2-time Immersion Grad, Cruising Writers Grad
 
1.    Katya’s heart rate shot up, kicking into triage mode.
2.    A gut-bomb went off in her stomach.
3.    The ground tilted, and her stomach staged a hot-dog rebellion.
 
Mad About the Marquess, Elizabeth Essex, 3-time Immersion Grad
 
1.    Her heart was going to be worn out from all this starting and stopping. It would help if she remembered to breathe.   UNDERSTATED VISCERAL RESPONSE.
 
2. A softer sense of alarm—or perhaps it was guilt—padded across her shoulders like a stealthy barn cat. 
      
3. Her heart was beating so fast it was a wonder it didn’t jump right out of her bodice, and run amok about the room. 
 
4. Quince’s skin went a little cold, and that sharp- clawed sense of alarm scratched its way down her spine.
 
Find Me, Romily Bernard, Multi-Margie Grad, Golden Heart Winner
 
1.    I feel like my insides are about to turn outside, like even my bones want to escape.
 
2. Then why are goose bumps still climbing up my arms? Rhet .Question
 
3.  Something cold coils in my gut. 
 
4. Chills push goose bumps through my skin. 
 
5. Now that Carson is gone, my skin is trying to shiver loose from my bones.
 
The Darkest Lie, Pintip Dunn, Immersion Grad, RITA Winner, NYT Bestseller
 
1.    The tension is so thick I can feel it pushing into my lungs and expanding, slowly but surely, until I‘m taking short, quick sips of the air. 
 
2.    My throat works, trying to swallow something that isn’t there. 
 
3. The air turns solid, and no matter how much I gasp and pant, I can’t draw a proper breath. I want to run and scream. I want to shout to the world that they have it all wrong. My mother wasn’t a slut. She was a victim. She was wronged.
 
4. I rip a poster off the nearest wall. An anchor lodges at the pit of my stomach, dragging it lower, lower, and even lower still.  
 
5.  My eyes widen, and it’s like someone turned up the volume on my heartbeat. I feel and hear it everywhere—in my ears, at my throat, on my chest.  
 
6.    I press myself against the wall, my breathing quick and shallow and frenzied.
 
7.    The chill begins in my stomach and spreads outward, until my limbs feel as brittle as icicles. One hard slap, and I’ll shatter to pieces.
 
 
The Seduction of Cameron MacKay, Sheri Humphries, 2-time Immersion Grad
 
 
1.     She felt like an abandoned bagpipe, air leaking out until all that remained was a limp, empty pouch, all the while her heart pounding like a regimental drummer beating a tempo designed to make her gasp.
 
2.     His arm fell from her waist and he moved a step away, which made her legs wobble and her heart clench.
 
3.     He held her, chest to chest, belly to belly, until her heart slowed and her skin dried.
 
4.     The knowledge rent her heart, her lungs, her belly, like a giant hand reached inside and tore through her most vital organs.
 
5.     Cam’s heart skipped then raced helter-skelter. 
 
Evil’s Avenging Angel, Jenn Windrow, 6-time Immersion Grad
 
1.     Each step towards Julian’s home made my stomach twist. Not in an anxious, lovesick way, but in an I-know-something-bad-happened way.
 
THIS, NOT THAT, BUT THIS STRUCTURE
 
 
2.     That one tiny detail of Delano’s diabolical plan was enough to fill me with stomach-churning, heart-clenching, lung-contracting, fear.
 
 
3.     Something skittered down my spine, settling in the pit of my stomach.
 
 
4.              A grenade of fear exploded in my stomach, and I knew I couldn’t face what was about to come alone.  IMPACT ON POV
 
 
Bitter Falls, Stillhouse Lake Book 4, Rachel Caine, NYT Bestseller
 
1.    My heart is pounding like I ran all the way from Stillhouse Lake.
 
2.    That doesn’t stop my heart from racing, or my muscles from tensing.
 
Structure:  Organ-action, Organ-action
 
3.    My heart races so hard it hurts.
 
4.    And I feel my heart racing, and taste the acrid, bitter surge of adrenaline.
 
5.    My whole body is trembling in time with the heavy, racing thud of my heartbeat. I’m coiled like a watch spring and ready to explode.
 
6.    I can’t turn my head; my body feels heavy and cold. The sound of the siren gets dimmer, slower, and then…
 
…then, despite the racing of my heart, the desperate need to get up and go after my son, everything fades to black. 
 
7.    There’s a pressure inside me like a scream. It squeezes my heart and lungs, and no matter how deeply I breathe the pressure doesn’t ease. 
 
8.    Shock blows through me like an explosion, but it leaves something else: rage and fear, tearing along my nerves and pooling cold in my stomach. 
 
9.    I start feeling that tension creep up my spine, knotting muscles as it goes. 
 
10.  Fear is like a knife down my spine.
 
11. She’s shaking her head, God no, she’s shaking her head and I feel the desperation inside coil and twist like a snake through my guts. 
 
12. Then I realized just how dangerous this is, and it feels like electricity crawling all over my skin. The jolt of fear feels like lightning striking, but I push that away. I need to be smart now if I want to get through this, but my brain is racing, babbling, wondering what Bon is doing, why he could have done this to candy, when...so many questions. But I don't ask them. I just breathe, and watch. 
 
Lies We Tell Ourselves, Steena Holmes, 2-time Immersion Grad 2-time Immersion Cruise Grad
 
1.    My heart stops, then starts, blood rushes to my ears with the power of a tidal wave.
 
2.    A lead wrench lodges in my stomach and it twists, tightens, and twitches until I'm about to heave. I swallow hard and hope I've somehow been able to cover the distress that's no doubt written across my face.
 
3.    There's a sick feeling nestled in the pit of my stomach, churning, burning its way to my throat. 
 
4.    My heart quickens, picks up speed until it’s pushing against my chest. 
 
5.    Their anniversary? My stomach boils over and I'm throwing up. My head pounds, my throat is scorched from the bile and I wish I could block out his words.
 
6.    My heart jolts, jumps, skips a few beats, refusing to settle. 
 
7.    Jess isn't strolling down the sidewalk, arm in arm with that stupid boy she was flirting with. I turn and look across the street, to see if she's walking on the other side, and a sick twisted gnarly knot sprouts in my stomach for a fraction of a second before growing into a flare of molten anger when the realization hits me. 
 
My sister is nowhere to be seen. 
 
8.    My heartbeat races, my chest aches from the steady drum, my hands sweat from the stress. 
 
9.    My stomach does a flip-flop, a gut-kick reaction to that banner beneath my own photo, except it's not meant to be me. It's meant to be my sister. 
 
10. Furious. Furious and guilt-ridden, and sick to my stomach knowing how close I was and still had failed. 
 
11. For a moment everything I'm thinking, feeling, disappears and I'm empty inside. Then the tsunami of anger hits, piercing my heart and spreading out until my hands fist, my leg bounces, and I need to hit something.
 
12. Why are the police at the house? Is it dad? Had something happened?
 
Mom motions for me to hurry.
 
My chest feels like it's about to explode from the instant pressure of anxiety that hits me. I drop my bike on the driveway, not bothering with the kickstand, and rush to the front door. Fear fuels my steps, panic carries me across the paving stones and launches me into mom’s waiting arms.
 
Her arms aren't warm, welcoming, wrapped around me in protection.
 
Her arms are straight, strong, her stranglehold of a grip fastened around my shoulders. 
 
“Where is your sister?” Mom asks, her voice carrying the weight of bricks despite the fact she's a clear mess.
 
The nauseating grasp that sweeps over me isn't because mom’s lips tremble with her question, nor because her eyes are saucer wide as she stares at me.
 
It's because mom’s voice buckles, brakes, bursts with a rawness I've never heard before as she repeats her question .
 
“Paige, where is Jessica?”
