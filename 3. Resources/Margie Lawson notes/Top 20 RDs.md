Prologue from Walking on Broken Glass, by Christa Allan, Margie-Grad
 
If I had known children break on the inside and the cracks don’t surface until years later, I would have been more careful with my words.
 
If I had known some parents don’t live to watch grandchildren grow, I would have taken more pictures and been more careful with my words.
 
If I had known couples can be fragile and want what they are unprepared to give or unwilling to take, I would have been more careful with my words.
 
If I had known teaching lasts a lifetime, and students don’t speak of their tragic lives, I would have been more careful with my words.
 
If I had known my muscles and organs and bones and skin are not lifetime guarantees that when broken, snagged, unstitched or unseemly, can not be returned for replacement, I would have been kinder to the shell that prevents my soul from leaking out.
 
If I had known I would live over half my life and have to look at photographs to remember my mother adjusting my birthday party hat so that my father could take the picture that sliced the moment out of time- if I had known, if I had known- I would have been more careful with my life.
