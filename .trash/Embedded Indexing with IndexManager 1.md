## 9.9 Embedded Indexing with Index-Manager

In this exercise, Jan Wright takes you step by step through the embedded indexing process, using the text of her lecture on embedded indexing to work in Index-Manager.

Depending on which version of Word you are using, save the [Word 2003 version of Topic 9.1](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565731/download?wrap=1 "m9_ex5_word2003.doc"), or the updated [Word 2007 version of Topic 9.1](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565733/download?wrap=1 "m9_ex5_word2007.doc"), or [Word 2013 version of Topic 9.1](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565915/download?wrap=1 "m9-ex5-word2013.doc") , in which you will embed the index.

This is an **_optional_** _**activity which will neither be graded nor included in your course grade.**_ You may choose to complete it or not but it is recommended that you copy down this section to further explore Index-Manager at your leisure after you have completed this course.

## Index-Manager Tutorial

Index-Manager is an embedded indexing utility that works with Word files, XML files, and InDesign IDML files. In this lesson, you will be introduced to Index-Manager, and examine an indexed Word file to see how Index-Manager handles index entries. Index-Manager has a lot of capabilities beyond embedding, such as being able to show word frequencies, but for this introduction, we will focus on the basic features.

Before beginning this section, it would be a good idea to [download the trial version of the Index-Manager application](https://index-manager.net/en/download-en/) and install it.

When you register to receive the download, you will receive a **license key** for activating the demonstration copy of Index-Manager. Write that number down, as you will need it to run the software.

You will also want to finish **Lesson 9** and make a copy of your final Word file from that lesson. It will be the file you submitted with Word embedded indexing. Make a copy of it, and rename it for this lesson.

This lesson does not have an assignment to turn in, so do not worry about making mistakes. You can’t harm anything.

**Important NOTE**: Take a moment now, however, to check your Exercise 5 Lesson 9 Word file and make sure that all your **XE fields** have uppercase XE’s, not lowercase xe’s. Older versions of Word tend to put in lowercase xe’s. That works fine for Word, but Index-Manager really likes uppercase XE’s. If your file has lowercase XE’s, do a search and replace. Here’s how:

Find > Advanced Find and Replace > Replace tab

Type in: xe(space) – putting that space in there will mean you won’t pick up the word “indexes” when you do your replace.

Replace with XE(space)

### **Requirements for this tutorial**

-   Microsoft Word
-   [Index-Manager application download](https://index-manager.net/en/download-en/)
-   Completed Word file with embedded indexing from Exercise 5

### **Back up your files**

**Note**: when you receive an embedded indexing project from a client, it is a VERY GOOD IDEA (which means “Do this, because you will regret it if you don’t and your computer crashes or your files get corrupted!”) to duplicate the files, and tuck a copy away in a folder called “originals.”

Do that now (if you haven’t) with your Exercise 5 Word file. Make a copy, and tuck it away.

### **A quick note about files**

Index-Manager imports the text from your Word file, and allows you to index it without changing the Word file until you are ready and feel your index is ready for the first export. Your Word file stays intact and unchanged until you export entries to it. All your work is recorded in a special file called an IDX file. So your original Word file remains the same until you export the entries into it. If you want to add new entries or edit already exported entries, reimport the Word file into Index-Manager, and then add new entries and correct the indexing. Your work will be saved in a new IDX file and then inserted into the Word document by re-exporting. These steps can be repeated as often as you like.

### **Install Index-Manager**

Follow the directions at the [Index-Manager application download page](https://index-manager.net/en/download-en/) and install Index-Manager.

### **Open Index-Manager**

Double click on the icon.

### **Licensing information**

You are using a temporary license that is good for 14 days. When you registered, you received a **license key**. Enter that number on this screen.

### **Index-Manager’s opening screen**

This is the opening screen of Index-Manager.

![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565937/preview)
![[Pasted image 20221110131500.png]]

Let’s take a moment to explore this window. One of the best things in it is the help in the lower right corner, in the green area under the **Start button**. Take your mouse and hover over each option in the left column and watch what is displayed in the **Help** area. You can enlarge the whole window by pulling sideways or down on it with your mouse, just like any other window. But you can also make the green area bigger, by positioning your mouse at the top border of the green until the icon changes to a resizing icon, and then resizing the green area upwards. Do that now, so that you have lots of room to read the **Help** area.

You can also hover over items in the background, behind this window. When you opened Index-Manager, a second window may have opened behind this window; if it did not open, don’t worry—you will get to it later. However, if you can see it, hover your mouse over the **Index Preview** **panel** on the left, and read about it in the **Help** area. Don’t click, just hover. Hover over the **Text** **panel** in the middle. Hover over the fields in the **Text** **panel** and read about them. Then try hovering over the buttons at the top of the **Text** **panel**. Many buttons in the interface have **Hover Help** with explanations and hints, so remember to hover over buttons, tabs and interface elements. We will continue to look at that Help in a moment, once we finish explaining the opening window.

When you are done hovering on the background window, let’s get to work.

You want to remain in **Text mode**, a choice you can see in the left column of the opening window, for your beginning work. Each of the choices in the left column rearrange the windows in Index-Manager for specific tasks, like editing your index, or working with cross references. **Text mode** is best for starting your index.

### **Creating a project**

The center column of the opening window is where you will see the files you import for your project. And the right column is for projects themselves. Each project can have multiple files, if the book you are working on comes in multiple files. Or a project can have just one file.

If you have multiple projects, you could click on them in this window and see the files associated with each one displayed in the middle column. But for now, it is empty, as we haven’t started anything yet.

We are starting a new project. So keep the **New Session** highlighted in the right column, and then click the blue underlined “**Import manuscript files**” in the middle column.

Navigate to the folder where you stored the renamed copy of your indexed Word file from Exercise 5. Highlight it.

Click the **Open button** to add the Word file to your project.

![[Pasted image 20221110131558.png]]

![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565783/preview)

You have now started a project with one file in it. Your Word file will probably have a different name than the one shown here. The screen will reflect the pathway to your file, and your chosen file name.

Click the **Start button**. You may get a **Progress dialog box** that will show the file being imported. (Note: Each version of Index-Manager seems to behave slightly differently, so you may not get a **Progress dialog box**. If not, that’s okay. Just go ahead to the next step in the tutorial. And at times, the **Progress dialog box** comes up and goes away so quickly that you don’t see it.)

The **Progress dialog box** may indicate that there is a warning; we can ignore any warnings and proceed.

### **Exploring the interface window**

Now you can see the full Index-Manager window. Index-Manager has a lot of areas and panels to explore. Let’s take some time to see what is here, and to rearrange the panels into a good workspace for you.

First off, let’s explore more of the **Help** functions. You can find all the built-in Help and **Hover Help** under the menu item **Help > Contextual help \[F1\].** Here’s a sample of what is in the Help system for the Index Preview panel.

![[Pasted image 20221110131612.png]]
![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565765/preview)

When you open the **Help dialog box**, you need to “freeze” it so that it will stay open when you leave it to hover over the various panels and tabs in the interface. You can freeze it using the **padlock** symbol, the Windows command \[Ctrl\]+\[F1\], or the Mac OS command \[CMD\] +\[F1\]. Go and hover over the panels or interface elements and read what the Help says for each. Close the **Help dialog box** when you are done.

![[Pasted image 20221110131658.png]]
![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565753/preview)

You can drag all of these panels around within one window or pull them out into another window (or even to another monitor) and change their columns and sizes. Let’s leave them be for just a moment, though, and take a tour.

![[Pasted image 20221110131705.png]]
![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565785/preview)

The most immediate thing you see is the text of the Word file in the center **Text panel**. Above the text, you see a bar containing **1, 2,** and **3** fields, an **anchor** **button**, a **Create Entry button**, a button that says **Aa**, and other features. This is the area where you write entries, using the fields.

-   **1, 2,** and **3** refer to levels of subheads.
-   The small **Arrow buttons** allow you to swap subheadings.
-   The **Anchor button** allows you to place an entry in a specific place, although you can also swipe through text to place an entry. You can click the anchor, highlight some text, and then add an entry.
-   The **Aa button** capitalizes or lowercases text in your entry.

On the next level down in the bar you see the word “**Index**” and a slot. You can create multiple indexes, such as a name index and a subject index. This slot allows you to select which index the entry should go in.

**Format B** or **I** formats the page number with bold or italic styles.

The Word version of the **page range features** allow you to insert the beginning of a range (\[ ) and the end of a range ( \]) or to swipe through a range (\[ \]). Note that if you are working with InDesign files, these options will be different and will match the InDesign options for page ranging. Index-Manager switches this automatically when it detects InDesign files.

The little **Broom icon** allows you to erase highlighting from the text, which you would use if you accidentally swiped through the wrong anchor point for an entry.

Note: If you want to search the text in the Text panel, \[CMD\]+\[F\] or \[Ctrl\]+\[F\] toggles a **search box** at the base of the text. Try that out now if you want.

### **Reviewing the Word file’s text in the interface**

Scroll the scroll bar in the **Text panel** up and down, and you can see the contents of the Word file. Note the yellow highlights; remember these from Exercise 5? Index-Manager is showing you all the entries that have been made, in place, as well as the colors.  

Note that you aren’t seeing any page breaks. The document is in one continuous flow for the file.

### **Arranging the parts of your interface window**

Let’s examine the **Index Preview panel** in the left panel by clicking on the Index Preview tab. If you can’t see the Index Preview panel, open it by going to the **Window** menu and choosing **Index Preview**.

You should see your entries from your Exercise 5 assignment showing up in the Index Preview panel, in alphabetical order. Note that there are two columns. We can change that display.

![[Pasted image 20221110131746.png]]![[Pasted image 20221110131753.png]]
![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565935/preview)

If the **No. of columns** box is set to 2, change it to 1.

![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565813/preview)

It’s useful to have your **Cross-references panel** all ready to go, too. If it is not already displaying, go to the Window menu and choose “**Cross-references**” to display that panel. Then choose “Edit” from the Window menu to uncheck that option, which will hide the **Edit panel** if it is showing.

![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565749/preview)
![[Pasted image 20221110131802.png]]

Drag the **Cross-references panel** to position it however you like. Notice how the panels can be separate or can snap into groups with tabs at the top, as in the screenshot above.

It’s nice to position the Cross-references panel in a group with the Index Preview panel on the left. You can see it as a tab above.

Switch back to the **Index Preview panel** in the left panel by clicking on the Index Preview tab. You should have the **Text panel** in the middle, the **Index Preview panel** on the left, and the **Index panel** on the right. These are the three panels we will be working with in the first part of this exercise. If they aren’t showing, use the Window menu to open them and then drag the windows to arrange them.

### **Index panel display**

![[Pasted image 20221110131812.png]]
**![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565853/preview)**

The **Index panel**, illustrated above, is a _database_ view of your index. You should see entries showing up in this window from your exercise. You can choose from a lot of columns and information to display in that panel.

In the Index panel, note that the display shows you the order in which you made entries. You can re-sort this view by clicking in a column heading. To sort by most recent entry, click the **No.** column. To sort alphabetically, click the **Entry** column.

Let’s look at the fields you have available in the Index panel. Right click on any of the tabs in the header bar (the area that says “**No**., **Entry**, **Subentry**, etc.) and a menu pops up with all the columns you can display. Adding the **Page range** field so that you can see where your entries are ranged is a good idea, so check that in the menu.

The **Filter box** finds entries with specific characters in them. Try typing a word into the Filter text slot. The view changes immediately to just the entries with that word. To see all the entries again, just delete what you typed into the **Filter box**.

If you are familiar with the grouping functions of Cindex, Macrex and Sky, the **Filter box** can perform the same functions. You are able to find a group of entries that you may want to perform a single search-and-replace action on. You do that by finding all the entries you want with the **Filter box**.

By the way, you can widen and narrow all the columns in these panels. If you can’t see everything, hover over the labels of the columns until you see the resizing icon, and then just rearrange things to your liking. You can also uncheck columns to hide them in the display.

### **Examining existing entries**

In the **Index Preview** **panel**, highlight an entry by clicking on it. Note how the text in the center **Text panel** jumps to show you the entry in context. You can edit this entry directly with a double-click and typing in the **Index Preview** **panel**, or in the **Index** **panel** on the right. Double clicking in any of the cells in the Index panel allows you to edit entries. You can also edit by double clicking on the entry in the Text panel. The entry is re-inserted automatically in the 1, 2, 3 fields above. You can edit the entry and finish the changes with a click on the **Update Entry** button**.**

### **Making new entries**

The best way to see how everything works together is to actually jump in and make some entries. Let’s turn our attention back to the **Text panel** in the middle.

Highlight a word in the text and watch that word appear in the index entry fields at the center top. In the illustration below, the word “pictures” has been clicked on in the text, and has automatically filled in the first field at the top.

![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565955/preview)
![[Pasted image 20221110131840.png]]

You can highlight names in the text and instantly add them, or you can rewrite the text appearing in the field to make the entry more concise or match your indexing style. Try highlighting text in the document and adding entries. The **Create Entry button** inserts the entry.

![[Pasted image 20221110131847.png]]
![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565767/preview)

Go ahead and edit the text in the entry fields. Again, you are not handing this file in for review, so don’t worry if you make a mistake or an oddball entry. Experiment with all kinds of entries.

To add a subhead, you can hit **Tab** to get to the second field. The second field is for subheads, and the third field for sub-subheads.

Look at the existing entry for “converting:printed indexes to online”, which has a subhead. Look in the **Text panel** and examine the entry in context in the document. See the pipe character ( | ) that separates the main entry from the subhead? The pipe character is the divider that separates main heading text from subheading text. You can add it when you edit entries in the fields or edit entries in the **Index Preview panel**. 
![[Pasted image 20221110131854.png]]
![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565967/preview)

As you make entries, look at both the **Index Preview** **panel** on the left and at the **Index** **panel** on the right to see how your entry appears in both. Remember, you can sort the **Index panel** by clicking on the column headers.

Notice as you create entries that Index-Manager displays your previous entries in a drop-down submenu so that you can choose an existing entry when you want to match terminology. 
![[Pasted image 20221110131901.png]]
![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565831/preview)

If you hover over the **Create Entry button**, you can see it has a shortcut: Alt + C for Windows or Option + C on the Mac.

You may be thinking you need to save your work. You don’t! Index-Manager saves every change you make, so you don’t need to stop and save your work. It stores all your changes in a **log** **file**, which has the extension .idx. So keep working and don’t worry about saving.

If you don’t want a capital letter in an entry, click on the **Aa button** to lowercase it before clicking **Create Entry**. And try using shortcuts to create entries, Alt + C for Windows or Option + C on the Mac.)

### **Forcing the sort**

The easiest way to edit index entries, view the way that they sort, and force the sort is in the **Index Preview panel**. You can add the sorting information and then immediately see that the entry sorts correctly.

One easily-added entry for this document would be for “.ZIP files”, which you would sort under Z, not under the period. Go ahead and add an entry for that.
![[Pasted image 20221110131919.png]]
![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565829/preview)

![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565871/preview)
![[Pasted image 20221110131926.png]]
_NOTE: Again, you can widen and narrow all the columns in the **Index Preview panel**. If you can’t see everything, hover over the labels of the columns until you see the resizing icon, and then just rearrange things to your liking._

To force a sort on that new .ZIP entry, add a semi colon (;) to the end of the entry, and then type the text as you want it to sort (.ZIP files;ZIP). Hit Enter and watch where the subentry moves in the display.
![[Pasted image 20221110131933.png]]
![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565827/preview)

### **More about creating entries**

If you find you have typed in an entry and forgot to select some text for it, the **Create Entry button** will be dimmed. This happens all the time when you first start working with the program. When it happens, rather than starting over and losing the entry data you have already typed in, use the **Anchor button** feature to find the entry a home.
![[Pasted image 20221110131940.png]]
![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565949/preview)

Click the **Anchor button** and then swipe some text where you want the entry to go. The **Create Entry button** will be usable again when you are successful, and if you click it the entry will be inserted at the location you highlighted.

If you have an entry with a special character that you want to “escape,” or have Index-Manager ignore in the sort, try using a \\ character before the problem character.

Also note that you can correct misspellings or edit text by clicking on the entry either in the **Index Preview panel** or in the **Index panel**. Either works for editing.

### **Deleting entries**

If you need to delete a mistaken entry, highlight the complete line with the mistake in the **Index panel** and press the **Delete key**. (If you have a Mac laptop that does not have a Delete key, use Function + Backspace.)

### **Cross references**

To add a cross reference, switch to the **Cross-References tab**—it’s one of the tabs on the left side, or perhaps you positioned it elsewhere. If it is not open, use the Window menu to open it, and arrange it where you want it.

![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565777/preview)
![[Pasted image 20221110131952.png]]
Decide on a new see reference, and start typing the text in the first field in the upper left corner. An easy one that would work in this document is “users See clients.” Type “users” in the left empty box.

The “**see**” in the middle box is for a standard See reference. If you want a See Also, click in the “see” box and add the word “also” to the “see” that is in there. After this, you will be able to choose it from the little drop-down menu. You can also add “See” with an uppercase “S”, and “See also,” again with an uppercase “S,” if you prefer your cross references to use an uppercase letter.

Click in the third box and type in your main entry, “clients.” Then click the **Add button**. If the main entry does not exist, your cross reference will then appear in **red**. That’s a signal to make the reference match actual index entries before exporting.

![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565751/preview)
![[Pasted image 20221110132000.png]]
Switch back to the **Index Preview** **window** to see the cross references in-place in the sorted index.

![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565737/preview)
![[Pasted image 20221110132006.png]]
Now, switch back to the **Cross-references** **panel**. Notice the **red** color of the two other cross references. Index-Manager is telling you that you have no targets for these two cross references. If you export your index now, _Index-Manager will delete these_. Whatever is in red will be deleted. So be aware that you MUST FIX ITEMS in red before exporting.
![[Pasted image 20221110132016.png]]
![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565821/preview)

The first red one is easy to fix. Go back to the **Text panel** and add an entry in the text for “WinZip.”

You will also have some trouble if your See Also text is incorrect. Look at the WWW.IBACKUP.COM cross reference above. During the importing process, Index-Manager didn’t agree with Word about how that should appear. It put the “also” in the Main Entry field instead of leaving it with the Sees in the Type field. Having the Also encoded in the **Main entry field** of the Cross-References panel will cause Index-Manager to look for an entry beginning with the word “Also.” Can you see in the illustration above how the “also” is in the target area, not in the **Type** field where it needs to be? You can fix that problem by typing “also” into the See box, and then deleting the “also” and its codes from the section that reads “web backup services.” Then create an entry for “web backup services” somewhere in the Text panel and the red text will go away. You can see the corrections already done in the image below.

![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565779/preview)
![[Pasted image 20221110132024.png]]

The numbers at the end of the Main entry items tell you how many entries are at the targeted term. So “clients” has two entries associated with it. “WinZip” has only one. After fixing your “web backup services” by adding an entry for it in the **Text panel**, you will have (1) entry listed for it in the **Cross-References panel**, as shown above.

### **Page ranging**

Let’s try a page range. Switch your attention back to the middle **Text** **panel**. Type in the text for a new entry, whatever subject comes to mind, and then click the **\[ \]** **button**.

Select all the text you want included in the page range to highlight it. You can use the little green brackets as your indicator of where it will start and stop. Then click **Create Entry**, and you have a page-ranged entry.
![[Pasted image 20221110132036.png]]
![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565873/preview)

An example of the green bracket at the end of a page range.

Page ranging can be tricky at first, so try a few ranges to get the hang of it. Remember, you aren’t handing in this file, so don’t worry about mistakes.

### **Exporting the index**

From the **File** menu, choose **Export**. The **Export dialog box** appears.

![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565953/preview)
![[Pasted image 20221110132043.png]]
There are several options to understand here:

-   “**Create fresh work file**”: You can ignore this now, but it is handy when you have started your indexing with one set of files and you get new versions of your source documents with some changes in them from the client. Work files (IDX files) are the way Index-Manager makes it possible to use all of your existing indexing in the client’s newly-changed files. It means that the publisher can continue to make minor edits (not major—just copyedits, really) while you index. If that ever happens during a project, when you are ready to export into the new Word files, you click this option on. Clicking this option will consolidate the current version of the indexing data from your exported document into a fresh new work file.
-   “**Attach index**”: Leave this off for this tutorial. This is what you use if you have one Word file, and ordinarily you want it on. It will put the index for you at the end of the Word file. When working with multiple Word files, leave it blank, or you will get a mini index in each chapter. Because your Word file in this tutorial already has an index field in it, the one you built in Exercise 5, you don’t need to add a new index at the end of the document. It is already there, and we will update it at a later step.
-   “**XML indent**”: You can ignore this unless you are working with XML output.
-   “**Index name as first level**”: This is for multiple indexes in InDesign. InDesign doesn’t support multiple indexes as it stands, and this option separates out the entries into two indexes, such as a name index and a subject index.

You should have no items checked under the “**Options**” section.

Make sure your file name on the left side of the dialog box has a check mark, and then click **Export**. It will go very fast, and the bottom of the window will tell you it is done.

After it exports, click **Export Complete** to close the box.

Then **close** Index-Manager.

### **Close Index-Manager**

Choose **Quit** from the Index-Manager menu to close Index-Manager. Always close it after an export. This instruction is in yellow so you will pay attention. Always close Index-Manager after an export.

### **Finding all the files that Index-Manager has created**

Use File Explorer or Finder to go to the folder where your Word document is living, and open it up to see the Word file. You will see that your Word document has been updated and has a recent time-stamp on it; there should be a new date in the file information.

**Reminder**: Index-Manager automatically creates an IDX file for your file when you first import it. Every step you make is logged as you make it, so that you don’t have to save during your indexing. You should see this IDX file with the same name as your Word file in your document folder. Do not delete the IDX file while you are working – it holds all of your work in progress until you export.

When you export your indexing into your Word file, the IDX file is what tells Index-Manager what to do. There is also an archive file created, but it is hidden. (If you ever want to see the archive files, you can display the Archive folder: In Windows, use the Organize menu > Folder and search options > View tab > scroll down to hidden files and folders > select > Show hidden files, folders and drives.

On the Mac OS, use Shift + CMD + dot (period).)

When you have worked back and forth in Index-Manager and have exported a first set of entries, and then re-imported the document back into Index-Manager and created more entries and done some editing, some of the information about your entries is in the IDX file, and some is in the archive file. So it is important to keep all the related files for Index-Manager available; do not delete them.

### **Checking the index in Word**

Let’s open your indexed Word file in Word. Look for the new index entries you added in the text and see how they are working. You should see them in place in the text. If you do not see your entries, remember to turn hidden characters on. If you added a “WinZip” entry to fix that red cross reference problem, try to find it and examine it.

Remember building your index in Exercise 5? Scroll to the end of the file, and update your index to incorporate the new entries. To do that, highlight the existing index, and press F9 to update the index.

Once you can see the newly-compiled index with new entries, can you see some things that need to be fixed? Now, you _could_ fix them right here in your Word file by making text edits to this index, but you don’t want to do that—the next time you generate the index, your corrections will be gone.

You could also edit the index by finding the entry fields themselves within the Word file and editing them there. That’s a viable option.

But the easiest method is to work with the file in Index-Manager again and make your fixes there.

Save and close the Word file.

### **Revising the index** 

**Reopen** Index-Manager. When you do, you go through the same startup screen, and select your project with its files. When you re-open Index-Manager, the file selections of the project you last worked on appears by default, so that you can continue working quickly.

![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565913/preview)
![[Pasted image 20221110132109.png]]
In the right panel, select the project, then choose **Start**, just like you did when we first began.

Index-Manager will open the panels to the default settings. Go ahead and rearrange your columns and panels to the way you like to work.

Try fixing, changing or adding new entries to the file.

Notice that when you click on an existing entry, Index-Manager takes you back to the spot in the **Text panel** where it is embedded. Can you see that in the **Text panel** in the middle? You can move around and re-examine your indexing in context much more quickly than trying to find the entries in the Word file in Word.

The **Index** **panel**, the database view, also has a lot of right-click functionality for editing, but we must turn it on. It is not on by default. Right-clicking allows us to swap headings, apply italics, and a lot of special functions similar to our stand-alone indexing software.

### **Loading the Right Click Menu**

To get your full right-click functionality, go to the **Extras** menu and choose “**Index actions**.” In the **Index actions dialog box**, you will see a list of shortcuts that have already been entered by default, but we want to get the full range of right-click actions ready for use. Click the **Defaults** button at the bottom. This will populate your program with even more shortcuts. It is not on by default because it will overwrite any customized shortcuts you may have created. It is good to set this up early in your workflow, so that when you add your own shortcuts later on, they don’t get overwritten.

![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565755/preview)
![[Pasted image 20221110132118.png]]
Now that you have the shortcuts loaded, you can see what will be available to you by right-clicking in the **Index** panel. For example, you will be able to merge a subheading into the main heading with the **Merge levels** shortcut. You can perform all kinds of swapping actions: swap a main and a subhead, add parentheses, reorder names, etc. You can add initial caps, and format entries with italics and bold text. These will all now appear in your right-click menu, and there are the keyboard shortcuts available as well. When you get proficient with Index-Manager, you can write your own shortcuts for right-click functionality. If you are on a Mac, you will swap in Command for Ctrl, and Option for Alt in these shortcuts.

Click OK to close this dialog box.

Now notice how many other options you have now when you right-click an entry in the **Index** **panel**. You can swap levels, duplicate entries, and edit entries. You can edit your entries in either panel, but the **Index panel** has more advanced right-click options. In the **Index Preview** **panel**, though, you can edit your main heads and have the changes ripple through all of the entries at once. So each side has its advantages when you are editing.

If you would like to make an entry italic, there are two ways of doing it:

You can do it the hard way by putting <i> before the text and </i> after (<i>your entry here</i>), just as you do in HTML files. Index-Manager knows about these codes and will alphabetize it correctly.

Or you can use your right-click menu to make it italic. It’s the “.docx italic” option. And, there are also shortcut keys: Alt + I or Option + I. Index-Manager will even mark InDesign entry text for bold and italics, something InDesign doesn’t do. Macros run on the final index text story will add the bold and italics for the designer before they take the book to the printers.

### **The Word List panel**

Index-Manager has a lot of powerful functionality hidden beneath the basics. It analyzes text, can perform regular expression (GREP) search-and-replaces, and can show you all kinds of details about your index and your text, including how much indexing is in a specific section of the file, and whether you need to go back and add entries.

One feature that is interesting is **Word List**. Choose “**Word List**” from the Window menu. The **Word List panel** shows you the occurrences of words and phrases in context; you can set options to search through the book’s text for all incidents of specific words or phrases.

The default display is really too small to use, and you should rearrange and enlarge things to see them better. Try enlarging the **Reduce To** and **Exclude** portions of the window by dragging the frame down. Try to enlarge the middle portion where you can see the list of words in the document.
![[Pasted image 20221110132141.png]]
![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565787/preview)

You can choose various options to display what language, nouns and phrasing there is in the document. The **Reduce To** option allows you to select just what types of phrases and words you want listed in the word list. In the picture above, we have only words with capital letters displayed. If you click that option off, you can see every word, and how many times it occurs in the document. You can alphabetize the list of words by clicking on the **Word** heading.

The **Exclude** section allows you to get rid of stop words, like “A” or “the,” from the list.

One function this list is really good for is choosing a Word heading style, and quickly checking that you have indexed all the topics in a book’s main or chapter headings. Or, if there are words throughout the book in italics, you can quickly see them by choosing the **Word inline style italic** option. Choosing the **Always starting with a capital letter** option pulls up all the important words that are capped.

Clicking on any item in the **Word list** allows you to see it in context in the **Text panel**.

### **Depth of indexing**

The **Structure window** shows the sections of your book and how much indexing is embedded in each part. It’s very useful for seeing if you have skipped a section, or under-indexed a section. Unfortunately, our little exercise file doesn’t have much structure to it, so viewing that window for your file only shows how many index entries we have over all.

![](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565869/preview)
![[Pasted image 20221110132150.png]]
Let’s look at a more complex book, because this window can display important information. Again, you can rearrange and expand these columns. The open arrows on the left indicate that there are more subsections under a section, and the structure can be expanded further. You can expand and collapse the structure using the arrows. In this more complex book above, Chapter 2 is expanded.

The columns in this window tell you a lot about the content. “**Words**” is the number of words in the document. Subsets of the document have their word count in “**Own words**.” And “**Entries**” shows you the number of entries in each part.

In the project below, we have adjusted the column widths of the window so that we can see the **Ratio** column. You can use the green color to check your project and make sure the chapters that need indexing have indexing, and see how many entries there are. Assume you estimate about 400 words per page and want about 4 index entries per page. So any ratio above 1.0 in the **Ratio** column suggests you may have over indexed the section, whereas anything less than 1.0 suggests you might want to take another look.

![[Pasted image 20221110132202.png]]
The Structure window can also help you navigate quickly to another portion of your book. You can click on a chapter or section heading to bring it up in the **Text panel.**

### **Re-export the index**

Check your index and see if you have misspelled anything or have typos. Remember you can fix them in either the **Index Preview panel** or the **Index panel**. Give it one final look, and then choose Export from the File menu.

### **Close Index-Manager**

Always close Index-Manager after you export.

### **Checking the final index**

Reopen your Word file in Word. Go to the index, click in the existing index text and press F9. You should now see your changes.

### **Explore further**

There are a lot of features in Index-Manager that we have not explored, but feel free to look at the website videos and explore the features we haven’t looked at. You can go through the videos and watch all kinds of advanced operations at the Klarso website. Here are some important links:
