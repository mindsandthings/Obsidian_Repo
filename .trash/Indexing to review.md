You may want to do some reading on the SkyUsersGroup on Google Groups and read about Sky 7 vs 8 incase you go with Sky. There are some people who strongly prefer 7, they find 8 unstable. I use 8, I'm tempted by 7. I haven't had any of the disasters people describe. I don't know if it's user caused or software caused!

I pretty much go p 1 to page 325 or whatever it is. I might do a few pdf searches, but not often. I often use Do Mi's note of mrbfr, meaning "more before this page" if I've decided to start picking something up and I think there are earlier references to it.
