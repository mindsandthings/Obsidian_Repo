MARGIE’S FIVE QUESTION SCENE CHECKLIST

Some writers knock out a dirty first draft. Others polish as they go. Both systems work. Follow whatever system works for you. 

What works best is having a system that suits your style. As long as it’s a successful system, use that system. 

Whenever you’re ready to Deep Edit, dive into my 5Q. My Five Question Scene Checklist.

The five questions are easy. It’s the subsets under each question that are killers. :-)

Margie’s 5Q: The Five Question Scene Checklist 

 1—Any Missed Opportunities? 

Power Openings? 
Power Endings?
Senses? 
Fresh writing? 
Cliches? 
Specificity? 
Characterization? 
Pacing? 
Flow? 
Rhetorical Devices?
White Space?
Scene-themed? Character-themed? Emotion-themed?

Analyze scene components with the EDITS System.

Check every sentence, every passage, for cadence. Is the cadence compelling on every page?

Have you missed other opportunities to add power or clarity? 

2— Could you tighten a sentence, page, scene, chapter? 

Could you nix or tighten:

	Throw-away words? 
	Telling Tags?
	Setting?
	Walking the dog?
	Backstory?
	Flashbacks?

Do you have too much EDITS System Yammering YELLOW?

Could you sprinkle in backstory, setting, and character description in more interactive ways?

Could you pick up pace by nixing a section and replacing with a narrative line or paragraph, and still keep your reader informed and hooked?  


3— How could you enhance emotion? 

Write fresh. Write fresh. Write fresh.
Power Words? 
Backloading? 
More Body Language and Dialogue Cues? 
Add more Visceral Responses? 
Add more Rhetorical Devices?
Add more Emotional Hits?
              --- Take Basics to Complex? 
              --- Complex to Empowered? 
	   --- Empowered to Super Empowered?
Does a Turning Point need to be Empowered or Super Empowered?
Could you strengthen your hook at the beginning and end of scenes and chapters?
	Could you add Character and Emotion Themed words?  
Could you deepen characterization by adding more body language and dialogue cues? 
Could you add and/or empower visceral responses? 

4— How could you add tension and up the stakes on the page? 

Show, don’t tell.

Ask yourself, so what? Who cares?  

Dig deeper and show more subtext.

-- Do you need more nuances of body language? 
-- Do you need more incongruent body language and dialogue cues?
-- Do you need more visceral responses? 

Can you deepen characterization?

Can you add a complication? 

Can you make the problem worse? 

5—How Does It Rate? 

Rate each page. Rate each scene.  

Choose 1 – 10, 10 being your best work. Is it a 10?

What do you need to do to bring it up to a 9.7?

Grab your highlighters and check your EDITS System patterns. Get tough.

Apply the 5Q again. Get tougher. 

What do you need to add? Tweak? Nix?  Rewrite?

If you can’t give that page or chapter a 9.7, why not? 

When you get it to a 9.7 - 10, know why.

Be prepared to defend your rating with your critique partners.


Class – I could add a dozen more points to questions 1 – 4. Feel free to add what you need to check. Echo words?  Clichéd facial expressions?  Need to use more rhetorical devices to boost interest and cadence? Other points?

The fifth question is just as important as the first four. Don’t skip it. Don’t avoid that critical assessment. Make your WIP strong.
