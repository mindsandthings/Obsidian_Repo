Currently working on retraining my fingers to a new keyboard - bought myself a full size (including number pad) Razer keyboard lat night.

Yes we did - a couple of centimeters I'd guess over night.

Oh nice. I use an external keyboard from my laptop. It's a cheap one but I like it fine.

I can't complain about the rain. We needed it!

The Razer was on sale for about 40 so not too expensive. Now I'm trying to return my finger habits to the "old" Macrex key combos I used to use (with, IIRC, far more accuracy than the combos I started using after my laptop didn' t have the home/end/pageup/down keys, even two years after learning them)

And the Razer macros software is making this even more fun.

I'm doing an intense part of my textbook update. The Essentials version is compressed. I have the Full version loaded into the new Essentials index with 1000 added to locators, pages for Full and Essentials open, original Full version open, and last edition's Essential also open in Macrex. I made the three Macrex files different colors, and have to pay close attention to which pdf pages I'm looking at because they are very similar. Whew!

Congrats on the new keyboard, Elena!

I never use the "del" key in Macrex, and it's right next to the "end"key, so now it's actually a comma.
