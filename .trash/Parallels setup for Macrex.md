Under Application Shortcuts, uncheck âŒ˜H for hide windows. Now it will work like Ctrl-H. 




Elizabeth: I've actually figured it out.  
  
If you go into the Parallels drop down menu, Preferences, then under the virtual machine (Windows 11/10), and there is the drop down for Profile. i thought that set which profile was "active", but I think they all run simultaneously. I usually have mine set to Windows. But I changed it to Mac OS and changed Command+H to something else (Command+Shift+H) and now Ctrl+H works fine in Macrex!
