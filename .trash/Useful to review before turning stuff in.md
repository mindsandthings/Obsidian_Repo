Once you've gone through the indexing process to ascertain your metatopics and subtopics, follow these guidelines:

-   All of the main topics are listed in the index as main headings.

-   The information relating to those main headings is broken down for the convenience of the reader.

-   The double-posted entries, both main headings and subheadings, consistently list the same page references.

-   The same information is listed, and accessible to the reader, at multiple access points.
