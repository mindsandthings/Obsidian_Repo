#### Course Description

Taxonomies are structured sets of terms used for tagging or categorizing content. They are used in a wide variety of applications ranging from document indexing, digital asset management, enterprise content management, commercial product categorization, online news service interfaces, and web site information architecture.

This course provides both a basic introduction to taxonomies, discusses best practices for creating terms and relationships, and provides some practice to start working on taxonomies and thesauri. This course also includes exclusive student trial access to some taxonomy management systems.

This course was originally developed for the Continuing Education Program of Simmons University School of Library and Information Science. In 2017 the university discontinued the Continuing Education Program, so now the course is offered directly through Hedden Information Management.

#### Course Basics

**Duration:** This course was designed to take a month, but it can be completed in slightly more or less time, as desired. Regardless of how long it takes to complete the course, access to the course and instructor feedback is for two months.

**Lessons:** Lesson texts are comprised of a set of three to six web pages, one for each chapter of the lesson. Each lesson has links, and some have associated graphics of screenshots. It is not necessary to go through an entire lesson at one sitting, but each chapter page is designed to be read at one sitting. The lessons and chapters vary in length, depending on the topic. The intended pace is one lesson per week, but you may proceed faster or slower.

**Exercises/Assignments:** Most lessons have assignments. Although it is not required to submit the assignments, for all participants in the full-price course all submissions will receive individualized instructor for feedback, and answer sets will be provided. You may also modify to content of some of the exercises to reflect examples in your own work. Questions to the instructor are welcome at any time. A discounted version of the course without feedback also includes receipt of answers to assignments.

**Software:** Special software does not need to be purchased to complete the workshop, but students should try a free demo version of one or more of the software tools discussed in Lesson 4. Hedden Information Management provides exclusive student trial access for the duration of the course for web-based application PoolParty. Additionally, MultiTes and Semaphore Ontology Editor may each be used for a free 30-day trial on one’s own. Students of this course may also purchase the full license of MultiTes for personal use at the discounted price of only $99.

**Readings:** The required reading is: ANSI/NISO Z39.19 _Guidelines for Construction, Format, and Management of Monolingual Controlled Vocabularies_, which is provided as a freely downloadable pdf.  
Also, highly recommended is the book: [Hedden, Heather (2016) _The Accidental Taxonomist_, 2nd edition or by October 2022 the 3rd edition.](http://www.hedden-information.com/accidental-taxonomist.htm)

Links to additional articles on the Web are provided within each lesson.

**Hours Expected**: The number of hours put in depends on the extent that you work on a taxonomy project of your own and how much optional reading you want to do. Past students have put in from 2 to 8 hours per lesson, with 5 hours per lesson being the average.

#### Course Advantages

**Individualized feedback and answers to questions**

In contrast to a group course, where discussion forum etiquette is to ask questions only of common interest to the other students, in this individualized course, it’s acceptable to ask specific-case questions.

**Always available to start any time**

The continuing education workshop previously taught through Simmons University was offered only a certain number of times per year and students had to register 2-3 months in advance before the session filled up. Sometimes people need to learn taxonomy development skills on shorter notice or at a time when a college course is not being offered. This independent self-paced online course is always available, and participants can start as soon as they register and pay, even as soon as the next day.

**Less of a commitment than a college continuing education course**

The continuing education workshop previously offered through Simmons University was set at 5 weeks. Inevitably, every session there were students who could not finish the course in that time due to various unforeseen circumstances. This independent self-paced version of the online workshop has the same amount of content but remains available online to students with instructor access for questions for two months (9 weeks) by default, and requests for extensions are always granted.

#### Comments from Past Students

> _I just want to let you know what an excellent resource you have put together. It is by far the most comprehensive, I have come across.  I just finished the first lesson! Thank you for sharing your knowledge!_
> 
> _I wanted to thank you for teaching one of the most informative online classes I have ever participated in. I’ve come away with exactly what I wanted – an overview of what a taxonomy is and how it is constructed, as well as some of the things to look for (intermediate steps J ) to make sure it’s well constructed, and the ability to build a simple one of my own in a pinch. The other thing I’ve taken away is an admiration for taxonomists; it is exacting work!_
> 
> _Most classes I’ve taken have been either very elementary or extremely tech-y. This one was perfect for my level of expertise and gives me a good foundation to gain some professional experience with working with, creating, and maintaining taxonomies._
> 
> _I enjoyed this course and the detail, clarity, and dedication with which it was created._
> 
> _The course was thorough, and it seems like no stone has been left unturned. I really appreciated the updates to the lessons, and the inclusions of comparison tables. More of this please! Furthermore, it was really good to have access to various software’s and putting the theory into practice. I think that once I have worked on thesauri for a while, this course will provide invaluable in its theory, but I believe that it will require me to be able to visualize the theory in a practical way before properly understanding it. This is of course down to my own personal learning style and not a reflection on the course. Also, the course author was readily available to help, which was very much appreciated._
> 
> _I just wanted to say Thanks to Heather for the abundance of information she was able to share in such a short time frame, all re: Taxonomy._
> 
> _I agree with you about the benefits of this course, and Heather’s invaluable assistance. There is a lot to learn! I’d started the Accidental Taxonomist book before registering for this course. Now I’m going back and start from page one again. The two complement each other perfectly._
> 
> _Found this workshop to be valuable; smoothly-run website, and course material and format very clear. Thank you!_
> 
> _Enjoyed the course, well-run, good review._
> 
> _Just wanted to say thanks so much for a great workshop. I really got a lot out of it and enjoyed the rigorous pace and the depth of information you provided. I’m starting a taxonomy project in my workplace now, to implement in a new, currently under development, intranet. I’m referring to your weekly lessons quite a bit (!)_
> 
> _The taxonomy course has been such a help to me._
> 
> _I’ve really enjoyed taking this workshop. I was a little intimidated because I don’t have a library science background, but Heather is a great teacher and I learned a lot. Thanks!_
> 
> _Very pleased overall–I’m always surprised how effective and instructive online courses are. Well done._
> 
> _It was in-depth and challenging. I liked how seriously the subject matter was taken and how much one was expected to learn during the workshop._
