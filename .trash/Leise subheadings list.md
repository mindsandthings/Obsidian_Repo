Over the years, I have done a number of presentations  
and writings about the creation of subheadings and how to  
improve them. I have also discussed the crafting of useful sub-  
headings during the Introduction to Indexing workshops that  
I have offered at American Society for Indexing conferences.  
One of the things I generally emphasize is that it takes some  
time to build up a repertory of relatively short phrases that are  
subheading go-tos that will be used again and again during an  
indexer’s career.  
To help beginning indexers, and as a validation for expe-  
rienced indexers, I am sharing here a list of what I consider  
standard subheadings. I have combined similar phrases and  
listed each as a heading term in the list below. Note that your  
idea of similar phrases may differ from mine. That’s fine. Note  
too, that such a list is never complete; consider this as a spur to  
your imagination.  
My list of subheadings has been developed over years of  
generalist indexing. I have not included subheadings focused  
on indexing specialties. For example, if you do lots of medical  
indexing, your list of standard subheadings would no doubt  
include such phrases as diagnosis of, symptoms of, treatment of, etc.  
I have also included brief descriptors for the sets of phrases  
as an indication of how I think about them. In the descrip-  
tions, I use the term concept in its most general sense to refer to  
a person, place, object, institution, or idea. I hope you find this  
list helpful.
