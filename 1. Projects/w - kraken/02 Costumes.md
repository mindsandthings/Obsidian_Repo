Finally, I put together a fashion/faerie appearance pinterest board: https://pin.it/2zjdBXX
 
I'm also thinking more about faerie outfits, and I think I want to have some some involve living plants.

Spellworkers are in disguise for protection—however they want to be disguised. 
Off-duty faeries are glamoured like humans maybe?
Faerie outfits change by time of day. 
Richer faerie go through multiple costume changes over the day. 
 
Aimee's new designs are based on a remake of a feature from her childhood. 
 
Aimee liked the new character but didn't feel her costume was updated appropriately
