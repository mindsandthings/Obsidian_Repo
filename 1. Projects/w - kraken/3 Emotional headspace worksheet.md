One of my goals for this week was to figure out a process for figuring out where characters are at mentally/emotionally through a scene, so I can generate their internals more effectively. I did that today too:
	•	Check character's overarching desire/arc and where they are in it: 
	•	Review what happened in relevant earlier scenes
	•	What's their immediate goal? 
	•	What's their mindset for this scene—where are they at emotionally after events of previous scenes? 
	•	What kind of approach do they generally take to problem-solving?
	•	What do they know about obstacles they run into? What do the obstacles resemble from their past?
