# Stuff I have forgotten to put in the basements:
Animal detritus, including poop
Ecosystems - raw plant material for animal bedding etc. 
The basements also need transit, or wider tunnels to run carts or scooters or bikes down - maybe bike lanes. or animals. 
Air circulation
Maybe read a bit about biospheres? 
Elevators and other vertical transit that isn't stairs
Fewer round rooms - they'd remove bedrock in chunks. Also, there would be large blocks of rooms that were completely graystone, no halls. Unless I deliberately decide to do it otherwise, which I kind of want to do

# Types of rooms
Testing facilities
Gardens
Food sources
Offices / office-building equivalents
Meeting rooms
Factories
Auditoriums
Stadiums
Museums
Video-watching rooms
A church / place of worship
Stores
Restaurants
Recreation areas
Gyms
Parks


The Courts' active bedrock mines

There would be planned areas (square rooms etc) and organically created / tunneled areas, probably based on the bedrock mining capacity of the civilization at the time. Their layout would likewise be based on the community and society of the people who lived there. 

Magic stuff still tends to work (like the lights)

Halls
Transit paths
Side walks
Plaques and instructions
Slides, elevators, etc
Air circulation
Doors, because they'd make the doors out of graystone too. But maybe not the hinges? Maybe they all slide and are mostly left open? Maybe they're hinged and the hinges have rotted? 
Lighting


For stuff that needs processing, factories would be a ways away. For printer stuff, there would be printers in every set of suites. 

But also living areas
 - Cells
 - Bedrooms / suites
 - Meeting areas
 - Gardens
 - Living spaces with public common areas


# Furnishings and materials

there will be pictures and photographs and statues
— representations of knitting 3-d shapes
— A mural showing humans and much more faerie-looking faeries, maybe a creche. Maybe the fish people. Maybe multiple murals, of different ages.
— History of the kraken

Materials: 
— graystone. A non-magic hard-plastic-equivalent made of depleted bedrock (byproduct of getting energy from graystone). Bedrock can be easily shaped before being converted into graystone. Weathers but doesn't decay; the kraken shapes it specially. The basements are tunnels in bedrock that are harvested for energy and then turned mostly into graystone, with bits of activated bedrock left in to handle lighting and other magic. Graystone walls are often painted or tiled to break up the monotony. 
— flexible plastics TBD. 
— other stone. Graystone can be converted into other kinds of stone, though not without putting energy back in. Some tunnels have been converted to other kinds of stone, or decorated with it. Sometimes used for jewelry, especially with activated bits of bedrock left in to project effects. 
— metals (normal aging rates), made from bedrock. Tools, furniture, etc. [Look up decay rates for various metals]
— wood, usually made from trees (decays fast; luxury item; fresh wood not available to Flyer and her contemporaries). Art, rich funiture, jewelry. 
— ceramic (tiles), made from dirt or bedrock.
— paint, made from organic materials or bedrock. Some paints last almost forever; some fade quickly. 
— organic fibers: from plants and adapted animals

Early civilizations use tons of bedrock and have stuff that lasts a long time. The more recent you get, the less fresh bedrock is available, so stuff lasts less long - but it's more recent. 

Rich areas used metal, wood, and ceramic furniture, but forever paint. Poorer areas used graystone for many of the same things we might use plastic for (so their furniture is often still around, along with graystone art, plastic bits of things, etc), but cheap paint. 

Artifacts are usually activated bedrock in a graystone setting. 

Bedrock can be used to help preserve things, but it's expensive. (For example: it can preserve corpses)

# ANimals
Michael pointed out that the butterflies came with some mental instructions, and other animals might too


Translucent snails
Spiders
Cave bears
Cave hyenas, which trap large mammals

Mosses
Ferns

The animals they breed would have been bred for food or production
Goats (meat, milk fleece)
Guanacos 
Rabbits
Rats

Silk
Hair/fur
Feathers
Alpaca fiber
Mohair from goats
Spider silk
Silkworms
