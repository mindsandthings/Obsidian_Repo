There are a lot of Courts, but only one queen.

The Forest Court (the main court): Lots of nature. Shakespeare / typical nature, royalty, medieval. Where the castle is and where most employees live. The original Courts. Something for everyone. It looks old. Mostly fake villages and food; not many rides. Lots of shopping, especially jewelry. 
-- wooded area, lots of hills. Big dark-wood trees, moss. 
-- arts and crafts
-- small festival among lots of small ruins that are forts
-- faeries in the trees for spotting

The Night Court: monsters, sexy dark fae, urban fantasy. Neuromagic heavy, focused on fear and sex. Rides, fake villages, food. 

The Bright Court: kids, birthday parties, hobbits, flower faeries, wizard school. Famous characters. Generally no neuromagic. Rides, fake villages, food. 

The Ethereal Court: (AKA the High Court): crystals, angels; the old parts are High Elf (Tolkien psychedelic). Lots of neuromagic. 

Elflands: the upscale resort. Very upscale, grand architecture. Waterfalls. Where the diplomacy stuff takes place. [Get a name from Tolkien?] No neuromagic allowed. Extravagant and elegant.
