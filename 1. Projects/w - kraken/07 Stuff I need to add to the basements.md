Stuff I have forgotten to put in the basements:
Animal detritus, including poop
Ecosystems - raw plant material for animal bedding etc. 
The basements also need transit, or wider tunnels to run carts or scooters or bikes down - maybe bike lanes. or animals. 
Air circulation
Maybe read a bit about biospheres? 
Elevators and other vertical transit that isn't stairs
Fewer round rooms - they'd remove bedrock in chunks. Also, there would be large blocks of rooms that were completely graystone, no halls. Unless I deliberately decide to do it otherwise, which I kind of want to do
