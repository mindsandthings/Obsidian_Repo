Ancient people lived on the surface, gradually extending deeper into the basements and then abandoning deeper areas as the kraken expanded. 
Eventually, many of the underground areas were turned into a secret research outpost. People continued to live on the surface. Sometimes old areas were sealed up, especially when experiments went wrong, but sometimes for idiosyncratic reasons, so there are pockets of more ancient areas. 
In the early post-apocalypse, the survivors inhabited a small portion of the scientists' area of the basements. This included Flyer and other descendents of civilians and scientists, as well as descendants of some demons. They looted and rearranged belongings in these areas. 
Currently, only the top surface is inhabited by the Courts, although some water-dwellers live in the upper pools. The upper few basement levels are usually fine and are used for storage, trysts, etc. Beneath those are a couple layers of basements patrolled by guards to keep people out. The Courts have looted most of the upper areas of the basements and some of the medium ones occupied by scientists and post-apocalypse inhabitants. 
The lower top-side basements contain off-limits vaults and various dangerous animals that come from the creches (developed by scientists; later, set to generate randomly by Flyer to try to keep the place from being looted). The bottom surface has the stars, and various secret things. 
About half the scientists' areas are inhabited by the kraken, but it shifts sometimes, and sometimes old areas open up and new things are found. 
— Maybe the Roman Empire was trying to invade? Maybe they did invade, but the other side? and some of them were faeries too. People hid in the tunnels to try to get away from them. and fought them to keep them from getting home? and murals of death adn descrutction, or maybe 3-d videos—some of them home movies. (sign language?)
— touch and ranged weapon prohibitions

They stole the gateway from the demons!!! And the demons were trying to get it back
And also they stole the creche editing tool and a bunch of other stuff and were developing new weapons from them

Pre-war: 
	•	The basements included a secret R&D facility for illegal and semi-illegal stuff, with testing facilities. so like google labs. Specializing in neuromagic and animal development. Regular towns and cities on the surface. In the R&D facility: medals and awards, an internal history museum, etc. 
	•	They were also developing a stable gateway to the human realm, and tested it some - there are a lot more human-looking faeries after that point in time. 


War:
	•	Invaded for their resources by demons
	•	Did fight them off - by cutting themselves off and detonating a weapon
	•	Survivors retreated underground

Post-war:
	•	Ecosystem problems at the surface that took a long time to work themselves out
	•	Used as a dumping ground for dangerous magical artifacts, often only slightly hidden
	•	Eventually closed up and abandoned, then forgotten - just like many other war-ruined realms
	•	But someone left at least one experimental creche active (not human one) - that's why there are all the animals. And they don't know where it is to shut if off. 
	•	Also, the weather doesn't work well anymore

The Courts:
	•	Explored, mined and sold items on the black market, found a vault because the kraken had gotten in, took the gateway. May or may not have been aware of the creche editor. 
	•	decided to keep the gateway here and use it as leverage to set the place up as a prohibited talent refuge
