The Courts' active bedrock mines

There would be planned areas (square rooms etc) and organically created / tunneled areas, probably based on the bedrock mining capacity of the civilization at the time. Their layout would likewise be based on the community and society of the people who lived there. 

Magic stuff still tends to work (like the lights)

Halls
Transit paths
Side walks
Plaques and instructions
Slides, elevators, etc
Air circulation
Doors, because they'd make the doors out of graystone too. But maybe not the hinges? Maybe they all slide and are mostly left open? Maybe they're hinged and the hinges have rotted? 
Lighting


For stuff that needs processing, factories would be a ways away. For printer stuff, there would be printers in every set of suites. 

But also living areas
 - Cells
 - Bedrooms / suites
