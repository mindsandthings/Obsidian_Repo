Fairy economics

Faeries use small tokens as IOUs, often temporarily enchanted with illusion (via an external device) to keep track of what the IOU is for. This commonly makes them sparkle like gold. Currently in fashion for IOUs are small human-realm pebbles. 

Thanking a faerie indicates that you do not plan to return the favor, and is insulting because words are not equal to actions. However, it's fine to thank for small things (passing the salt, etc) though most people say "appreciated". "I am in your debt" 

Generally favors are kept between people, and it's not appropriate to share that someone owes you a favor. It's important to keep favors appropriate and bad to use them as manipulation, although people do this all the time.
