- Since faeries at the Courts had to be park employees, many Afar realms had responded by heavily funding performance arts and tourism management for networkers, and some faeries had begun the controversial practice of going into government jobs with the goal of securing later employment at traveling carnivals. 
- Elves a mildly superhuman longlived race living in world whiel faeries are super magical and live elsewhere - most faeries at the Courts are humanform and live longer due to good medical care; the non-humanform faeries don't show up as much 
- Early on, a faerie gives directions to Aimee and warns her to stay out of the water and out of the basements. I was most familiar with bogeymen as monsters who snatch you in the night, but apparently they generally exist to teach young children lessons and the stories are used to scare kids away from doing dangerous things, so I might make him look more bogeyman-like, which wikipedia informs me involves claws, talons, and sharp teeth.

Many of the Bogeymen are depicted as having claws, talons, and sharp teeth. Along with that, the majority of Bogeymen are of the spirit variety, while the minority are demons, witches, and other legendary creatures. Some are even described to have certain animalfeatures such as horns, hooves, and bug like appearances.[8] When looking at the personality traits of the Bogeymen, they are most easily divided into three categories; the kind that punishes misbehaved children, the kind that are more prone to violence, and the kind that protect the innocent. They all relate in the same way, being that they all exist to teach young children lessons. The large majority of Bogeymen are there to just frighten children with punishments, and not actually inflict much damage. The more vicious Bogeyman is said to steal the children at night, and even eat them. The last category is the Bogeyman who protects people and only punishes those guilty, regardless of age.[8]
