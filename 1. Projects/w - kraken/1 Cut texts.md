Aimee's heart ricocheted around her insides, doing all the moving she wasn't. She stood rigid, the toes on her lifted foot barely touching the ground.

An argument started among the guards. Not in English, in a faerie language with curved vowels and a melodic glide, but clearly an argument between an older guard who'd seen this happen before and a younger guard who knew that if this was the time it all went wrong, he’d be the one getting fired.


# Check-in book faerie

She wasn't sure what was going to happen, but the faerie touched her hair, nothing more than a quick tap, and withdrew, eyes closed. The little snake-dog was winding around her legs. 
The faerie's eyes opened. She went back to her box, pulling out several layers of trays, and handed two very small bottles to Aimee. One, she told Aimee with gestures, she could use to slick down her hair now; the other one came with a slip noting that it should be left on clean wet hair for ten minutes and rinsed out. 
Well, she'd try it, and it didn't seem like they were charging her for it. 

a small clear vial and motioned smoothing back her hair with it. 

The book faerie had set aside her book—it was Lord of the Flies, Aimee noted with some surprise, and it was sitting on the stump next to what looked like a dictionary—and she was kneeling in the grass, pulling small bottles and cosmetics from a box and adding them to a small pouch. A small animal sat next to her, the shape of a dog but scaled like a snake. Aimee hadn't seen it earlier, maybe it had been behind the booth. 

The other faerie held out a small pouch to her and made a quick go-on gesture at the biker faerie with her other hand. 

Aimee couldn't hide a little blush of pride; she'd done her best. 
She opened the bag. The palettes looked great, and were marked with the part of her face she was supposed to apply them to. "This looks great."
Her eye fell on the book. She pointed at it. "Good book?"
The faerie contrived to say, with one expression, that she was unimpressed with the sociopathic tendencies of British schoolboy culture. 

The biker faerie slipped a clear cover over his lap desk and set it aside. He'd been tatting a leaf in pale green thread, probably as a backup for one of the ones covering his tunic like overlapping scales, melted and purposely misshapen, like Dalí clocks

The book-reading faerie held up her hand, eyebrows raised.  
"She'd like to touch your hair," the biker faerie said. "For analysis. You can pull out a strand and give it to her, if you'd prefer not to be attached to it."
The book-reading faerie made an impatient gesture.
"You can also decline," the biker faerie said, "but nobody ever does." 
"She can touch it. The thing is, though..." 

Aimee felt a small glow of pride. She'd done her best at a natural look with what information was publicly available about Court guidelines.

, like a rat leaving a sinking ship for someone who would pat its little ratty head and give it the treats it so richly deserved, as opposed to an ungrateful hoyden like Aimee who barely even managed to clean its cage. Surrendering this possibly-legitimate-parking-space meant god knew how long driving in circles looking .

She unfolded the letter and smoothed out the wrinkles. They were impressed by her portfolio and willing to overlook her grades; they'd never taken a costume design intern before, but were willing to give it a try; they valued their human interns, who as humans had inside knowledge of the guests who visited the Faerie Courts Theme Park and Resort; they wanted to remind her to make sure to read all the enclosed informational materials and to arrive at orientation on time. 
The dogs stared at her like it had just occurred to them that what Aimee really was, deep down underneath, was a bunch of temporarily-animated walking bones. 


She was an organized mess, everything perfectly lined up and tidy and falling apart underneath. 

Most faeries didn't understand how magic and technology differed. They didn't understand you sometimes had to reboot a computer to keep it working. Didn't understand you had to avoid dropping it to keep it working. Didn't understand you had to avoid spilling coffee on it to keep it working, and definitely didn't understand you occasionally had to recharge a battery to keep it working. She wasn't going to fault them for not knowing the deeply arcane secret of how to network a laptop with a printer.

Have Aimee use this: Lily, with her carefully-scripted compassion and pity for the unfortunate, underlain by an ocean of contempt. 

magic worked like humidity she was going to be completely screwed.  Something had happened to her hair. Maybe when she’d gone through the gateway barrier. Maybe when she’d walked over symbols at Security.
