For Aimee and Bellflower, list emotions and kinds of visceral sensations. How do they experience things differently? e.g., Aimee's fear responses go to fight, tension, wariness; Bellflower's go to freeze and flight. Aimee has more "normal" viscerals; Bellflower has more unusual, psychologized ones. Aimee is grounded in her entire body, especially heart and gut; Bellflower is grounded mostly in her arms and hands and has more cross-sensory experiences. 

Aimee has panic reactions; Bellflower has freeze reactions. 

Aimee is heat and water; Bellflower is cold and earth

List out different ways, e.g. compare to a different physical sensation (net tightening), reference something else in the scene (kraken), reference something thematic. 

Also baby vs papa visceral responses. 

Also note acute stress reactions lecture 6 and visceral recoveries lecture 7. 

I would also like to do some analysis on Jim Butcher and some more analysis on Ilona Andrews. Maybe some Tana French. And some Martha Wells.
