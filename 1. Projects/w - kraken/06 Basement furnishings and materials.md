there will be pictures and photographs and statues
— representations of knitting 3-d shapes
— A mural showing humans and much more faerie-looking faeries, maybe a creche. Maybe the fish people. Maybe multiple murals, of different ages.
— History of the kraken

Materials: 
— graystone. A non-magic hard-plastic-equivalent made of depleted bedrock (byproduct of getting energy from graystone). Bedrock can be easily shaped before being converted into graystone. Weathers but doesn't decay; the kraken shapes it specially. The basements are tunnels in bedrock that are harvested for energy and then turned mostly into graystone, with bits of activated bedrock left in to handle lighting and other magic. Graystone walls are often painted or tiled to break up the monotony. 
— flexible plastics TBD. 
— other stone. Graystone can be converted into other kinds of stone, though not without putting energy back in. Some tunnels have been converted to other kinds of stone, or decorated with it. Sometimes used for jewelry, especially with activated bits of bedrock left in to project effects. 
— metals (normal aging rates), made from bedrock. Tools, furniture, etc. [Look up decay rates for various metals]
— wood, usually made from trees (decays fast; luxury item; fresh wood not available to Flyer and her contemporaries). Art, rich funiture, jewelry. 
— ceramic (tiles), made from dirt or bedrock.
— paint, made from organic materials or bedrock. Some paints last almost forever; some fade quickly. 
— organic fibers: from plants and adapted animals

Early civilizations use tons of bedrock and have stuff that lasts a long time. The more recent you get, the less fresh bedrock is available, so stuff lasts less long - but it's more recent. 

Rich areas used metal, wood, and ceramic furniture, but forever paint. Poorer areas used graystone for many of the same things we might use plastic for (so their furniture is often still around, along with graystone art, plastic bits of things, etc), but cheap paint. 

Artifacts are usually activated bedrock in a graystone setting. 

Bedrock can be used to help preserve things, but it's expensive. (For example: it can preserve corpses)
