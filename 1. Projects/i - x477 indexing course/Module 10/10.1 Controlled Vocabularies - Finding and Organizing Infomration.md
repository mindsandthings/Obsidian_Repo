## 10.1 Controlled Vocabularies: Finding and Organizing Information

![notepad](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565849/preview)_From the desk of ... Fred Leise_  
Fred Leise began indexing in 1995. He now consults in taxonomy development and content strategy, as well as working as a back-of- book indexer, both independently and as an associate of Potomac Indexing (PI). As a freelancer, Fred specializes in scholarly works in the humanities, including international relations and political science; East Asian history and culture; religion and philosophy; and biographies. He has also indexed a number of medical texts and technical manuals, including embedded indexes. He has contributed to several American Society for Indexing (ASI) publications, as co-editor of _Indexing Specialties: Cookbooks,_ co-author of _Indexing for Editors and Authors,_ and contributor of chapters to _Indexing Specialties: Scholarly_ and _Indexing it Right, Vol. 3._ Fred served three terms on the ASI board, including a year as president. He has presented numerous sessions and workshops at ASI national conferences and for local chapters around the country.

One of the continuing problems in the information age and online searching is for users to actually find the specific information they are looking for. Our language is the root cause of that problem. English has embraced words from many sources, so it contains multiple words with the same meaning, such as "cat" and "feline," for instance. It also contains homonyms, words spelled exactly the same, but which have completely different meanings. For example, "pitch" can be a tar-like substance, something you do with a baseball, the frequency of a sound, or a salesman’s promotional message.

As a result, if you do a free-text search on "cat," you might miss some relevant information that uses the term "feline," resulting in what is called poor recall. Similarly, if you do a free-text search on "pitch," you will get lots of irrelevant results, depending on the specific meaning of the word you are looking for. That means the search results have poor precision.

Creating a Controlled Vocabulary (CV) (now generally referred to as a taxonomy in the business world) can help solve both of those information retrieval problems.

### About Controlled Vocabularies

Since any time you choose to use one word over another -- say "cars" instead of "automobiles" -- you are creating a CV, when you create an index, you are creating a special type of controlled vocabulary. For example, you may use the author’s terminology when creating a heading or subheading, or you may use your own words to capture a concept that the author discusses but never names directly. In both of those cases you are performing what is called term selection, choosing the best words to represent the concept you have identified for indexing.

In addition, in multiauthor texts, you will often have to decide which term to use in the index when different authors use different terms for the same concept. (You’ll want to have "see" references from the alternate terms to help readers find the information.) That process, too, creates a controlled vocabulary.

However, for large collections of information, such as online databases or product catalogs, the creation of a separate CV becomes a crucial aspect of the indexing process.
