## 10.5 Indexing Exercise 6: Creating a Thesaurus

In this exercise, you will be creating a thesaurus from a list of given terms. Your job is to examine the term list first to identify synonyms (choosing a preferred term for each set of synonyms), identify broader and narrower terms, and finally related terms. You should then put the terms in an indented thesaurus format.

An example will show you how this process would work. Take a look at the following list of terms.

**Example Terms**

18-wheelers  
articulated buses  
automobiles  
buses  
cars  
diesel engines  
electric engines  
freight trains  
light rail  
multi-modal freight trains  
passenger trains  
pick-up trucks  
street cars  
subway trains  
tractor trailers  
train engines  
trains  
transportation vehicles  
trollies  
trucks

You should have identified "transportation vehicles" as the broadest term. You should also have noticed that there are a number of terms having to do with trains and several about trucks.

You may have noticed that "automobiles" and "cars" are synonyms, as are "light rail," "street cars," and "trollies."

Your initial analysis would probably produce an interim format for your CV, something like the following:

transportation vehicles  
    automobiles USE cars  
    cars USE FOR automobiles  
        (assuming you have chosen "cars" as the preferred term)

    light rail USE FOR street cars; trollies  
    street cars USE light rail  
    trollies USE light rail

    buses  
        articulated buses

    trains  
        diesel engines  
        electric engines  
        freight trains  
        multi-modal freight trains  
        passenger trains  
        subway trains  
        train engines

     trucks  
         pick-up trucks  
         trailers USE FOR 18-wheelers  
         18-wheelers USE tractor trailers

Next you would revise this CV by completing the broader/narrower term analysis, alphabetizing the terms at each level, and identifying related terms. This would produce the following final thesaurus, with preferred terms in bold.

**transportation vehicles**  
          automobiles USE cars  
          **buses**  
               **articulated buses**  
          **cars** USE FOR automobiles  
          **light rail** USE FOR street cars; trollies  
                            RT passenger trains  
          street cars USE light rail  
          **trains**  
               **freight trains**  
                   **multi-modal freight trains** RT tractor trailers  
               **passenger trains** RT light rail  
                    **subway trains**  
               **train engines**  
                    **diesel engines**  
                    **electric engines**  
          trollies USE light rail  
          **trucks**  
               18-wheelers USE tractor trailer>  
               **pick-up trucks**  
               **tractor trailers** USE FOR 18-wheeler  
                                        RT multi-modal trains

The final thesaurus is what you will send your instructor.
