## 10.3 The Process of Creating a Controlled Vocabulary

Every CV must be tailored for the specific context in which it will be used. There are three basic aspects to each context: the business rationale for which the CV is created; the characteristics of the content being tagged with or referred to by the CV; and the users of that particular CV.

Accordingly, each CV project should begin with a research phase that includes

-   Stakeholder interviews to learn about the business context;
-   A content audit or content analysis that identifies characteristics of the content such as how much content exists, what form it takes, and how often it changes; and
-   User research that explores how users think about the content that will be described by the CV.

After the research phase, potential terms for the CV are collected from the content and from users. Competitor websites may also be perused for appropriate terminology. Occasionally pre-existing CVs may be used and modified for a particular context, or an existing CV, such as the medical subject headings list called [MeSH](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/) (produced by the National Library of Medicine), might be licensed.

After the creation of the preliminary CV, the CV should be tested with content authors and users and any necessary adjustments should be made before final implementation.

As the last step in the CV process, a governance and maintenance policy should be established, since CVs are by nature living organisms, changing as language and terminology change. So someone needs to determine who is responsible for the upkeep of the CV and for establishing such things as whether provisional terms may be used, how terms are added to the CV, how often it is reviewed, etc.

You can use something as simple as a word processing program to create a controlled vocabulary. I have prepared many CVs using a spreadsheet program (I use Excel), which makes it easy to create a format that the client's IT department can use.

The following illustration is taken from a CV of business equipment, which was created using Excel. The indentation using various columns indicates the broader and narrower terms. As you can see, there are two top-level terms, "communication equipment" and "computers," each of which has multiple narrower terms. (The dots provide a visual indication of the indentation levels.)

Just as with indexing, there are also a number of dedicated tools that assist with the creation and maintenance of CVs. These tools include such software as [MultiTes!](http://www.multites.com/)  and Data Harmony’s [Thesaurus Master](https://web.archive.org/web/20140419212537/http://www.dataharmony.com/products/thesaurus_master.html), as well as automatic classification tools such as Autonomy's [IDOL](https://software.microfocus.com/en-us/products/information-data-analytics-idol/overview).

Such tools make it easy to revise the CV, without having to, for example, move multiple terms by hand. They also handle reciprocal relationships automatically, so that if you delete a term, it is deleted from all of the relationships in which it appears. The software also makes it possible to print out or present the CV in various forms, such as hierarchical or alphabetical, and to export the CV in various formats compatible with the needs of different clients.

Information management consultant Leonard Will provides a useful [list of thesaurus software](http://www.taxobank.org/content/thesauri-and-vocabulary-control-thesaurus-software) on his website.

The following are screenshots taken from Thesaurus Master, which not only makes it easy to work with a CV, but also allows for important documentation as well. (Images © 2009 by Access Innovations, Inc.)
