## Module 10: Controlled Vocabularies and Database Indexing

Indexers may have occasion to work with controlled vocabularies (CVs) during the course of their career. In this module you will be introduced to controlled vocabularies and when and how CVs apply to indexing. The basics of thesaurus construction will be discussed and students will have an opportunity to create a simple thesaurus. The art of database indexing will be presented by an indexer who works with this specialized type of indexing.
