## 9.5 Setting Fees for Embedded Indexing

In this topic, Jan shares her experience with fee structures for embedded indexing.

Fee structures for embedded indexing are tricky to negotiate, especially when you have not worked for the client before. If you have ever done book production in a tool like FrameMaker or PageMaker, you have seen that some people do layout well, with nicely structured files, styles applied where they should be, predictable pages, everything named consistently, and all the files being the right ones, up to date. And some people don't. The sloppy pages or file structure make it much harder for you to index, especially if text is "unplaced" -- missing in action or not spread out on a page properly -- or files themselves are missing or the wrong ones. Or if the author has applied styles in a sloppy way, that can affect PageMaker's page-ranging. In FrameMaker, heavy use of conditional text (text that only appears in certain settings or offprints of the book) can make your life much harder. Word can crash if the author has too many bookmarks in the file, and it's hard to page-range if the bookmarks have inconsistent names.

Try to obtain a sample file before bidding. Look through it and see if it has been laid out simply and that it is easy to understand the layout and file structure. Ask for an hourly rate if you can for your first job with the client, because you have a lot of unknowns to work through. Your time covers not just indexing, but also:

-   File transfers
-   Printing out files if you need to
-   Installing proper fonts so the files display correctly
-   Managing the versions of the files so that you have the most recent ones
-   Negotiating having all the files for final edit stage (This is a hard concept for most clients -- they don't understand why you need them all, and since this is their crisis time, they are loath to let go of them all at once.)
-   Scheduling when you will have which files and for how long
-   Testing your indexing to make sure it works
-   Compiling problems, which can waste hours
-   Troubleshooting index entries that do not work correctly

Hourly minimum should be at least $40 if you are a beginner. It helps if you can tell the client a maximum number of hours you will spend on it, so they have a cap. Remember, you bought this software package to do this kind of indexing -- and you must pay for it. FrameMaker, Quark, and PageMaker are not cheap. Add-ons like IXgen add to your costs, as well. You also cannot work as fast as in a stand-alone product, so your pages per day will be less than you think.

Once you have gotten to know the client's file structures, naming conventions, and usual mode of operation, you should be able to switch to a per-page rate, but pages are very fluid in the embedded world. A typical Word file might be thirty-five pages on your client's machine and thirty-eight on yours. Why? A different target printer changes the pagination. FrameMaker, Quark, and PageMaker behave much better and do have specific page counts, but Word is too fluid to do so. You and the client would have to agree on whose page count is the "right" one.

Online Web or help indexing also is hard to price out. Is a topic one screen of information, six screens of information you scroll down through, or four pages if you print it out? It's hard to agree, and the topics themselves vary a lot in length. So again, get samples, and try to figure out the average topic, as well as how you determine where a topic ends, before you set a per topic rate. Usually, a first-time hourly rate is best for these projects, as well. You have the same constraints listed above -- software, printing, transferring files, and so on. These projects take time, too -- more time than your average printed book.
