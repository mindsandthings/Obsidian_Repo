- Write an intro note re n for note to say notes are represented with n
- Finish up names, then finish this list, and send to Kendra
- Check all page numbers and ranges for names
- Redo cases as ranges
- ==go back through and pick up red topics
- ==go back through and index introduction
- review meta topic entry for double postings'
- remove alphabet separators
- take out fictional names
- don't index hypothetical examples
- submit the list of discrepancies/first name additions when you submit the index

Depending on characters' names: I have marked Cyrano de Bergerac and Christian with (fictional character), since it is otherwise ambiguous who or what is being referred to (since Cyrano de Bergerac was also a real person, and "Christian" is not solely a given name). I feel like for consistency's sake I ought to do this with Roxane, the third character from the play, but then that makes me feel like I ought to do it with all the fictional characters. 

Martial and Fidentius: I have indexed these as "Martial (Roman poet)" because "martial" is also a word, but was unsure whether this was necessary. With Fidentius, I indexed him as "Fidentius (rival of Martial)" because "Fidentius" on its own doesn't automatically read as a name to me. But perhaps this is not necessary. (177)

In a citations index, I index the name on the page it appears. For a combined name/subject index, if a person is the subject of a discussion spanning multiple pages, can I index the span? Or do I still index solely the appearance of the name, separately for each page?

### 1. Check publisher's stylesheet and set up index

Are main headings or only proper nouns to be capitalized? ==Only proper nouns.

What is the cross-reference format? 

==main heading: subheading; subheading;  
   subheading. _see also_ cross reference

==main heading. _see_ cross reference

What is the page locator format? Follow Chicago 17th; use an en dash, not a hyphen, to indicate a page range ==elided or full page range (124-26 or 124-126)? Chicago has their own specific preferred elision==


How will display material (tables, illustrations, photographs, maps, figures) be treated? N/A

How will footnotes or endnotes be designated in the index? ==check that they want e.g. 173n3, or if multiple notes what

Consider subheading levels -- will there be one level of subheadings or two levels, using sub-subheadings? ==Only one (no sub-subheadings)

What sorting order will be used: letter-by-letter or word-by-word? ==Letter-by-letter

What index structure format will be used: run-in, indented, or blended style? ==Run-in.

Will there be a letter heading or extra space between alphabetic groups in the index? ==ask about this

How much space is available for the index? Are there any space limitations that the indexer needs to be aware of for the project? 
(We'll discuss this important issue in a later module.) ==the maximum number is 300 lines and a maximum of 36 characters per line. Try to maintain an average of three to four entries per page in order to end up with the 300 maximum line count.

Are there any other special considerations for the index? For example: British or U.S. English spelling and punctuation? Special formatting of any kind (author names, titles, definitions in bold, diacritics)? What will be the treatment of function words in main headings: are they to be ignored in the sort or inverted?

==A combined name/subject index. 
Index all names found in the text using spelled-out first names.

==Ask about any special formatting, incl for legal cases

Delivery of index: is e-mail attachment of an RTF file expected? If not, what type of file does the editor require? Are there any special coding requirements for the file, including any for diacritics (accent marks)? ==Save the file in rich text format (.rtf) and attach it to your assignment submission. Be sure to include your name and course number in the name of the document: "your name X477 Indexing Project 3." Don't need to include software file. 

Determine page range. 


Macrex: Set up a folder for the client with defaults stored in that folder. 


==fix the formatting of cases -the v should be italicized too==

### 2. Start indexing

Remember:
* Over-index; it's easier to cut than add
* Write notes about alternate wordings, double-posting decisions, topic relationships, and queries
	* Cindex: enclose in asterisks
* Avoid repeating the text. Point to it instead. 
* Avoid indexing what the reader doesn't already know ("ten usability heuristics")
* Check that phrasing clearly conveys the meaning. 
* Ensure the same info is listed, and accessible to the reader, at multiple access points

Process: 
* Read the first chapter and skim the remaining ones
* Make a metatopic entry; keep metatopic firmly in mind
* Identify each section's main topic(s), using who/what/where/why/when/under what circumstances; look for ways to break down if necessary for the convenience of the reader (esp using why/when/under what circumstances)
	* Main headings are most often who/what/where, sometimes depending on material "when"
	* Why/under what circumstances often provide subtopic info; who/what can provide sub-entries that clarify the main heading (e.g., "what" main heading with "who" subentry or vice versa)
* Go back and find the smaller topics within the section, adding to the main topic and as their own main headings if relevant
* Double-check locators as I go
* Double-check names as I go
* Enter xrefs as I go

Main headings are what the user will try to look up; subheadings are for breakign down the info. 

if you can ask "how many", use the plural form in a main heading. 


If paper: make tick marks, one per index entry, on a word in the text that signifies that entry


16.88 Omission of article in indexed names of organizations. In indexing organizations whose names begin with the (which would be lowercased in  running text), the article is omitted. 

16.50 Indexing authored titles of works. A published work, a musical composition, or a piece of art that merits its own main entry should also be indexed under the name of its creator, often as a subentry. The main heading is followed by the creator’s name in parentheses (except in an index  in which all titles cited have the same creator).  Look Homeward, Angel (Wolfe), 34– 37  Wolfe, Thomas: childhood, 6– 8; early  literary influences on, 7– 10; Look  Homeward, Angel, 34– 37; and Maxwell Perkins, 30– 41  Several works by a single creator are sometimes treated as subentries under a new main heading, following a main entry on the creator. This device is best employed when many works as well as many topics are listed.  Separate main entries may also be included for the works. 


### While You're Indexing

Once you have started, pay attention to structural issues that may develop in your index.

-   Coverage of both general and specific topics
-   Metatopic overload (Are you lumping too much under the overall subject of the book?)
-   Completeness and comprehensiveness of main headings
-   Multiple access points for the same term
-   Cross-references to move users around the index

"What is this about?"
"If I looked up that term in an index, would I be pleased to find this information?"



#### Main Heading Issues

-   Broad main headings with too many subheadings: break them down into more-specific main headings.
-   Closely related main headings: combine main headings into one main heading.
-   Main headings needing distinctions in meaning: use more than one main heading, not one general heading for all.
-   Wording: use nouns, adjectives + nouns, gerunds, or noun phrases.

#### Subheading Issues

-   Subheadings that have too many locators: break out a subheading into a main heading and link it to the original main heading with a cross-reference.
-   Combine or delete subheadings if there are too many subheadings for the number of pages.
-   Wording: make your wording concise, using keyword access.
-   Sub-subheadings: avoid these if possible, but use with biography, medical, and legal materials.

#### Cross-Reference Issues

Cross-references must match the main heading exactly. Add any additional cross-references that are needed. Avoid the following:

-   Blind references
-   Circular cross references
-   Convoluted references leading to another _See_ references rather than directly to a main heading

#### Double-Posting Issues

Double-posting refers to the use of the same term or concept in different positions in the index (as main heading, as subheading, as acronym). These double-postings must be consistent. A thorough double-postings check also provides a way to look at the index in a different way. Use group mode on main headings and other concepts to find all instances of them within the index. Check these types of headings for consistent page numbers:

-   Direct flipping of main headings and subheadings
-   Subheading as a separate main heading
-   Foreign language terms and translations of foreign language terms
-   Acronyms/abbreviations and full form of name
-   Synonyms with few page numbers

#### General Editorial Issues to Keep an Eye On as You Go

While you're indexing, use the spell-check feature, and keep the following problem areas in mind:

-   Consistency in hyphenated words
-   Name-place organization starting with the same word
-   Proper names: check as you go
-   Inappropriate use of boldface or italic font
-   Parentheses and quotation mark sets
-   Spaces in wrong places
-   Consistency in spelling and capitalization
-   Locators that are obviously wrong -- large numbers, individual locators that should be combined in a page range (79, 79-81, 80)

### When You've Completed the Index Structure

When you are ready for the final edit and proofing process, allow some time for editorial distance. Start fresh in the morning or after lunch. You will need to counteract the "glaze-over factor" that comes from being involved with the material for several days or weeks. Separate pass-throughs for editing and proofreading are helpful, so you don't have to look for everything in one pass. Below is a suggested list of issues to concentrate on in separate passes.

-   Undifferentiated page numbers and synonymous main headings
-   Locators that are obviously wrong
-   Main headings with lots of subheadings and wording of subheadings
-   Double-postings of concepts, synonyms, and abbreviations/acronyms
-   Cross-reference accuracy


Don't index back matter for this course
Verify locators for all double-posts [have a way to mark as double posts]
Don't overindex - you don't need a bunch of subheadings all referring to the same page

If you are going to have an entry for West Nile Virus,  then you should provide access points to all the relevant discussion, either through subentries or cross references. One option would be to include broad-strokes subentries that cover the sections of the text. Another option would be to include the subentries here, and then cross references to other main entries (such as “symptoms” and “testing”) that cover the other sections.



### 3. Editing
* Before major editing, make a backup of the file
* Run spellchecker
* Check for orphan locators after a heading that has subheadings
* [Sky] Run "error scan" utility (improperly worded or circular cross references, orphan subheadings, improperly formed entries, and entries with more than five locators)
* Check for thoroughness and consistency in meaning and grammar
* [Sky] Use grouping feature to integrate similar concepts, eliminate redundancies, and add or subtract terms
* Check locator accuracy when reviewing terms
* Address flagged entries
* Possibly search for important terms to ensure thoroughness
* [Sky] Run error checking again
* Edit RTF:
	* Any required templates or formatting
	* Check for double periods, commas preceded by spaces, double parentheses
	* Run Word spell check
* Read through one final time

When I'm being thorough, I like to do what Do Mi explains in her book on 'cross checking'. Group on every entry with subheadings to make sure it's consistently double posted. That takes me a VERY long time (hours).

Validate cross-references
Verify locator formation
check subheading wording for collocation, differentiation, information scent and clarity; should review subheadings for parallel construction; and ensure that all subheadings reveal a clear relationship to the heading. 
 

use a special marker, produced with a keyword, to identify double-posted entries that have been cross-checked

-   Look back through the text for missed topics, using a "checkback" list kept during the entering process

-   Delete unnecessary subheadings

-   Create subheadings for entries with too many locators

-   Consolidate subheadings within entries

-   Use group mode to view and check double-posted entries

-   Check the alphabetical order for strange entries in which I may need to force the sort

-   Research queries

-   Address any concerns I had during editing, recorded in notes in the index or my word processor setup file (On more complex books, this may involve deconstructing and rebuilding large entries.)

-   Examine each line for errors

-   Group on initialisms (for example, on acronyms) by searching for two capital letters together using a macro, and check that they are either double-posted or cross-referenced

-   Have MACREX check cross-reference accuracy

-   Search my note marker to be sure I have addressed and deleted all notes


* Review the PNO to catch locator issues


A copyeditor's rule of thumb for checking accuracy in an index is to randomly look up 10 percent of the entries in the referenced pages. If only one or two inaccurate entries are discovered, then the editor should check another 10 percent of the entries. If no inaccuracies are found in the second group, one can hope that the inaccuracies of the first group are anomalous. But if more inaccuracies are discovered, the entire index must be checked. This can be a tedious and error-prone task. The main problem is how to resolve the inaccuracies. If an entry cites page 78 as its reference when in fact the page should be 178, it could be very difficult for the editor to locate the correct reference. The editor who attempts to resolve such inaccuracies will have time only to check for inverted digits (such as 87 instead of 78) and dropped digits (such as 178 instead of 78), but not to leaf through the text, hunting for other kinds of errors. If the reference cannot be corrected quickly, it should be deleted. If an index is full of inaccurate reference locators, it is not usable.
