Do you want cases double-posted? 

I have question about Index 3. 

***Review:
-- legal indexing (notes, Mulvany, Chicago)
-- names (notes, Mulvaney, Chigago: index as author put, if it's an alternate spelling, even if it conflicts with VIAF?)
-- footnotes and page refs: Chicago 17th
-- name index: Am I indexing the page on which the name occurs, or the page range that covers the discussion? Am I indexing every single occurrence, or skipping passing mentions? 


The course materials advise me to be judicious in queries, so I've divided my queries up into ones that I would actually confirm with a real client, and ones that I would ask more knowledgeable indexers about (i.e. that I'm addressing to you as the teacher of my indexing course, not to my hypothetical client). 


Before beginning any new indexing project, you'll need to make a few decisions regarding specifications. Clients will sometimes have a style guide prepared, but it is not unusual for them to give you instructions verbally or through e-mail. Here is a handy checklist you can use to make sure that you cover all of the pertinent issues during your communication with the client.

1.  Are main headings or only proper nouns to be capitalized?
2.  What is the cross-reference format?
3.  What is the page locator format?
4.  How will display material (tables, illustrations, photographs, maps, figures) be treated? ==is there any?
5.  How will footnotes or endnotes be designated in the index?
6.  Consider subheading levels -- will there be one level of subheadings or two levels, using sub-subheadings?
7.  What sorting order will be used: letter-by-letter or word-by-word? 
8.  What index structure format will be used: run-in, indented, or blended style?
9.  Will there be a letter heading or extra space between alphabetic groups in the index?
10.  How much space is available for the index? Are there any space limitations that the indexer needs to be aware of for the project? (We'll discuss this important issue in a later module.) ==300 lines
11.  Are there any other special considerations for the index? For example: British or U.S. English spelling and punctuation? Special formatting of any kind (author names, titles, definitions in bold, diacritics)? What will be the treatment of function words in main headings: are they to be ignored in the sort or inverted?
    
    _A Tale of Two Cities_ (Dickens)  
    _Tale of Two Cities, A_ (Dickens)
    
12.  Delivery of index: is e-mail attachment of an RTF file expected? If not, what type of file does the editor require? Are there any special coding requirements for the file, including any for diacritics (accent marks)?

# Questions for the client


## Name errata

Talmudic scholar Isaac Abarbanel (176): name authorities (VIAF and the Library of Congress) prefer the spelling Isaac Abravanel. ==go with?==

The "e" has been omitted from "Deane" for Deane Malott (more properly Deane Waldo Malott, president of Cornell University (180n47). Although he did serve at one point as an assistant dean, the note refers to events during his time as president. I have used "Mallet, Deane Waldo" in the index. 

Joe Balkoski (188): this author publishes under Joseph Balkoski, and when I search for Joe Balkoski the top hits (including his Wikipedia page) all list him as Joseph Balkoski. I have used Joseph in the index; please let me know if you would like me to do otherwise. 

191n93: Donald McCabe published this article under Donald L. McCabe (see https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Cheating%3A-Why-Students-Do-It-and-How-We-Can-Help-Mccabe/083a252e26bb8f483efefbe74163f6d2deb3891e). I have used "McCabe, Donald L." in the index. 




## Other
I have italicized case names in the index as they are italicized in the text; please let me know if you prefer a different format. 

Do you want the material indexed by section number or by page number? 

# Questions for you as my indexing teacher 
These are questions that I 

## Indexing footnote content

From the instructions: "Author and title citations are never included in the index from the footnotes. Individuals, including authors, who are _discussed_ (as opposed to merely cited) in the footnotes and have not already been indexed from in the regular text page may be included in the index. Only _new_ conceptual information found in the footnotes is included in the index. If the same conceptual information has already been discussed in the regular text of that same page, then the page reference should be from the regular text page only and not from the footnote."

I can read this as either one combined point (individuals discussed in the footnotes can included in the footnotes if they are not already indexed in the text BUT only if the discussion ALSO contains new conceptual material) or as two separate points (two types of material may be indexed from footnotes: discussions of individuals not already indexed from the text, and discussions that contain new conceptual material). For the Green index, which of these is the intended meaning? 

## Indexing all names in the text:  

Mulvany says "Legal books are commonly indexed by section number". Do you want me to use page numbers or sections numbers as locators? 

Regarding the requirement to "Index all names found in the text using spelled-out first names": 
does this include fictional characters?  
do you mean you want me to ignore middle initials? 
does the requirement to index *all* names apply to names of entities and businesses?
do you want me to include passing mentions as part of hypothetical examples? For example: "What is the point of finding new words to describe Einstein's Theory of Relativity" (180-181), "bootleg copies of a Richard Russo novel, Steven Soderbergh film, or Alison Krauss & Union Station CD" (201). Einstein, Richard Russo, Steven Soderbergh, and Alison Krauss's names are in the text here, but they are ad hoc hypothetical examples. 


## Errata


-- am I indexing the name or the discussion about the person? 

-- index the title "justice" (Holmes and Brandeis,205)?
-- 205n147: lists the authors as "Holmes, J." and "Brandeis, J."; the J refers to justice - is this correct practice? 

-- 210: last name Blackstone in quotes - assumign this is a last name - don't know if you want it indexed or not
-- how to index a name when the name is also part of a case? 
-- doublepost case names as both defendent and prosecution?
-- italicize case names?
-- one case takes place over a page break: prosectuion is on one page and defendeant is on the next. what page range to put? I have put the first one. 
-- am I indexing cases as names, or cases as discussion ranges? *note - I have been indexing as names, will need to redo if discussion ranges*
