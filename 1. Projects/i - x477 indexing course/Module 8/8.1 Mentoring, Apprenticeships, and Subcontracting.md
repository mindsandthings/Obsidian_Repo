## 8.1 Mentoring, Apprenticeships, and Subcontracting

After completing any indexing course, most new indexers have genuine concerns regarding additional training, securing that first client, and building a client base. There is a natural desire to secure as much personal guidance as possible to deal with these issues. Since you may want to seek out mentoring and/or apprenticeship arrangements with more experienced indexers, it is appropriate to discuss these arrangements as they exist in the indexing community.

### Mentoring

Mentoring relationships are a time-honored means of professional development within many disciplines, as well as in the corporate environment. A mentoring relationship is by nature reciprocal. That is, there are perceived rights and obligations binding both the mentor and the mentee. The mentor's obligations are to provide guidance, encouragement, and when appropriate, the means by which the mentee can gain professional advancement. The mentee's obligations are to listen, adhere to the advice given, and make continual professional advancements whenever the opportunity is provided. A mentor may enter into a mentoring relationship in an effort to give back to the profession or, in a corporate setting, to groom a successor. This type of relationship may extend over a significant period of time and has traditionally been beneficial for all parties as well as for the professional community or corporation.

There is one more important characteristic of a mentoring relationship: there are no financial exchanges between the parties.

Unfortunately, a true mentor-mentee relationship is uncommon in the indexing community. Most successful indexers are simply too busy to want to commit themselves to this level of obligation.

![Australia flag](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565761/preview)ANZSI did manage a formal mentoring scheme for a number of years whereby trainees could be mentored on their first 2-3 projects, but, due to logistical issues, the scheme has been discontinued, except in New Zealand where the local Branch administers the scheme.

The mentee pays $100 as an honorarium for the mentor, an experienced indexer. The mentorship is over a two-month period and does allow for renewal.

Much more typical, and easier for newbies to secure, is an informal relationship with an experienced indexer who makes himself/herself available to answer questions, review indexing work, and even extend guidance when needed. This is not, strictly speaking, a mentoring relationship because it does not entail defined obligations on the part of the more-experienced indexer as would be expected from a true mentor. However, many experienced indexers can be very generous with their knowledge and are often more than willing to extend themselves to new indexers. Attending local indexer meetings, as well as the national conventions of the indexing associations listed in Module 1, serves as an excellent way of meeting experienced indexers.

And information is always available on Internet discussion groups such as the Indexer’s Discussion Group (IDG) and the Scholarly Indexing discussion group. Do exercise caution, because the Internet has created an environment where anyone can claim "expertise" and dispense incorrect advice. But usually these kinds of lists have enough experienced individuals that there will be sufficient credible information given out to be of help.

==Some indexers offer a "mentoring service" to new indexers that is actually a consultation business _paid by the hour_. These services offer to review indexes and provide answers to questions for a set fee. While there is nothing wrong with offering an indexing consultation service, to refer to these arrangements as "mentoring" is an unfortunate misnomer and may lead to mistaken assumptions regarding the actual nature of the relationship. So if you are interested in pursuing that kind of arrangement, go into it with realistic expectations. The worth of these arrangements will depend upon the knowledge and expertise of the consultant, which the novice indexer is often not in a position to accurately judge.

### Apprenticeships

Apprenticeships are a traditional means of learning a practice or trade. This kind of arrangement is somewhat unusual in the indexing community but is more common than mentoring relationships. In an apprenticeship relationship, the more experienced indexer may ask the new indexer to take on specific tasks. The tasks might start with such simple assignments as proofing author citation indexes and progress to increasingly more difficult responsibilities.

When working as an apprentice, the new indexer should expect to be paid, though probably not at the same rate that an experienced indexer would be. This is because the more experienced indexer will have to take time, which translates to financial costs, to check over the work for accuracy and to instruct when needed. Over the course of a successful apprenticeship, an inexperienced indexer should gain the necessary skills to become a full-fledged member of the indexing community.

One more important issue about apprenticeships is the locality of both indexers. Physical proximity seems to be a commonality in successful apprenticeship relationships. Meeting other indexers at local indexing meetings can serve as a great aid in facilitating an apprenticeship.

### Subcontracting

Subcontracting is another way to gain indexing experience under the supervision of a seasoned indexer. When an indexer has a project that is too large to handle alone, or chooses to accept work but cannot fit it into his or her schedule, subcontracting may be a viable solution. In the first situation, a very large project, the indexer will act as a project manager by coordinating the other indexers who are working on the index or indexes. In the second case, the indexer will subcontract individual indexing projects to other indexers who, upon completion of the index, will turn in the index to the first indexer, who then reviews it and makes the delivery to the client. In both cases, the primary indexer is typically the only one to have direct contact with the client. The client may or may not be aware that there are subcontract indexers involved.

Though many indexers decline to subcontract out work, a significant number of indexers find this to be a mutually beneficial arrangement. Indexers working as subcontractors are expected to know the basics of indexing, be able to work unsupervised, and turn in indexes that will be acceptable to clients. Subcontractors will typically be paid a discounted amount since the primary indexer will have to spend time reviewing the work and/or coordinating the project.
