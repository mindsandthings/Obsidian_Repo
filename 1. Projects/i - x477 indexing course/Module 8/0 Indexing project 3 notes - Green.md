### 1. Check publisher's stylesheet and set up index

- [x] Are main headings or only proper nouns to be capitalized? ==Only proper nouns.
- [ ] What is the cross-reference format? ==main heading: subheading; subheading; subheading. _see also_ cross reference. main heading. _see_ cross reference
- [x] What is the page locator format? Follow Chicago 17th; use an en dash, not a hyphen, to indicate a page range ==elided or full page range (124-26 or 124-126)? Chicago has their own specific preferred elision==
- [x] How will footnotes or endnotes be designated in the index? ==check that they want e.g. 173n3, or if multiple notes what (I did not check, but will use this)
- [x] Consider subheading levels -- will there be one level of subheadings or two levels, using sub-subheadings? ==Only one (no sub-subheadings)
- [x] What sorting order will be used: letter-by-letter or word-by-word? ==Letter-by-letter
- [ ] What index structure format will be used: run-in, indented, or blended style? ==Run-in.
- [ ] Will there be a letter heading or extra space between alphabetic groups in the index? ==remove these
- [ ] How much space is available for the index? Are there any space limitations that the indexer needs to be aware of for the project? 
- [x] (We'll discuss this important issue in a later module.) ==the maximum number is 300 lines and a maximum of 36 characters per line. Try to maintain an average of three to four entries per page in order to end up with the 300 maximum line count.
- [x] Are there any other special considerations for the index? For example: British or U.S. English spelling and punctuation? Special formatting of any kind (author names, titles, definitions in bold, diacritics)? What will be the treatment of function words in main headings: are they to be ignored in the sort or inverted? ==A combined name/subject index. Index all names found in the text using spelled-out first names.
