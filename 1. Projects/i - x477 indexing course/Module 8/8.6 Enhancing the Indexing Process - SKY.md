## 8.6 Enhancing the Indexing Process: SKY

### John Bealle: How I Use SKY Indexing

![notepad](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565849/preview)I have been indexing for about a decade, focusing on humanities works for university presses. I work entirely from a laptop, whenever and wherever I can. I index because I love the books, I love working with authors, and because I love the places I am able to work.

_An account of how I create an index using the Sky 7.0 indexing program:_

I am strictly a no-markup indexer. Occasionally with a difficult book I will index the introductory and concluding chapter first, but usually I start on page one and go straight through. I have learned to be fastidiously inclusive at the beginning. Later, when I begin to understand the author's approach more clearly, I delete or modify inappropriate entries.

I work with .pdf files whenever possible. This is not only because it eliminates burdensome and tree-destroying paper -- it is also quicker to move my eyes from the index to the proofs and back if they are adjacent on the screen. And of course I can search for headings I've neglected to index.

This screen shot shows my indexing screen layout -- .pdf proofs left and Sky Index right.

#### Entering Index Data

To enter index terms in Sky, you type them into cells in a grid called the Data Entry Grid. This is a straightforward process common to many types of computer programs. I use repeatedly a few of the more advanced features that make the data entry process more efficient.

##### **Ordering Entries**

Sky has three ways of ordering the index entries in the Data Entry Grid: Sorted, Page Order, and As Entered. Generally I work in "As Entered" view so that I can see the previous entries above the current one. When I turn a page, I look to see what entries need page runs. Then I navigate up and use the page increment feature to increment the locator to a range. For example, if the page number is "223-224" the keystroke Alt-> will increment "224" to "225." If there is an ongoing discussion in the book involving several entries, I will assign them a label with Ctl-M. Then, when I go to a new page, I can instantly group the page-run entries with the Group-On-Label function Sft-Ctl-M and then increment all the pages at once.

##### **Entering an Already-Existing Term**

If I am entering a term that I know is already in the index, I use the Duplicate-and-Change-Locator function (comma key). First I navigate to the previous entry using browse. There is a Browse Dialog invoked with Ctl-Alt-B, but I prefer the silent browse using modifier keys. For example, if I want to browse to "education" in the index above, I hold down Ctl-Alt-Sft and begin typing "education." Sky follows each keystroke, navigating to the first matching record. Within a few letters the "education" entry appears in gray in the Preview Pane, and then Ctl-Alt-Space will navigate to that record. (If I merely want to look at "education" without going there, I omit the Ctl-Alt-Space at the end.) Then I go to the page field of the "education" record and use the comma key to Duplicate-and-Change-Locator. Often I'll notice double-posted records there that need to be duplicated also, so, before I duplicate, I select all pertinent records and then hit comma to duplicate.

##### **Creating New Entries from Old Ones**

Say, for example, that I come to a passage in the book on "commodity fetishism." I use Group-On-Text (Ctl-Alt-G) to group records with the text "fetish" and find several under "capitalism: commodity fetishism." At this point I decide there ought to be a Main Entry for this term double posted with the "capitalism" entry.

-   I navigate to the Sub1 field in any "capitalism: commodity fetishism" records.
-   I use Select Heading (F8) to select all records with exactly this text.
-   I use Ctl-F10 to duplicate the records and shift the current Sub1 field to Main. (The Ctl key triggers duplicate, and F10 is the Shift-Left-To-Main function, which will strip away any modifier words such as the "and" in "commodity fetishism and.")
-   If I don't want to double post "commodity fetishism" then I use Shift-Left-To-Main without the Ctl modifier, and the duplicate won't be triggered.

#### Function Keys -- A Powerhouse of Functionality

Shift-Left-To-Main is one component in the lineup of Sky function keys that together comprise a powerhouse of editing functionality. The layout of these functions is transparent enough that they can be quickly memorized -- so that complex editing tasks are often a quick keystroke away.

The four leftmost functions all pertain to the contents of two adjacent fields.

-   **F4 (Swap)** swaps the two fields.
-   **F5 (Promote)** promotes a subordinate field to the next highest, joining the two fields with the "promote separator," usually a comma.
-   **F6 (Demote)** demotes the rightmost part of a field, using the "promote separator" as a marker, to the adjacent subordinate field.
-   **F7 (Combine)** combines two adjacent fields with a space, rather than the separator character.

F8 and F9 are a pair of selection functions:

-   **F8 (Select Heading)** selects all records with identical text in all fields.
-   **F9 (Select Entry)** selects records with identical text in the current field and above.

The rightmost three functions shift the contents of the current cell.

-   **F10 (Shift Left to Main)**
-   **F11 (Shift Left)**
-   **F12 (Shift Right)**

Combined with the Control Key modifier, all of these commands will duplicate the current or selected records before executing the command function. Combined with Control and Shift, all of these commands will duplicate, then execute the command, then group the results.

Just as an example, say an author gives you a seed list of a hundred names to be entered in the index -- but they are in the uninverted form, "John Smith." After you import all the names, select them all. Then use F6 Demote, and change the "Demote Separator" from a comma to a space, which demotes all text to the right of the rightmost space. Then use F4 Swap, so that you now have "Smith" in Main and "John" in Sub1, with similar change in the other entries. Then use F5 Promote, this time with the comma, to promote "John" and get "Smith, John" in Main.

#### Editing the Index

When all the data is entered, I then use Sky's new Edit View to edit the index. With Data Entry View you work on records, in Edit View you work on headings, as if the index was in a word processor. That is, in Data Entry View if I change "commodity fetishism" to "commodity fetishism and," the changes apply only to that record (unless I manually propagate them with Ctl-Alt-Enter). In Edit View they are automatically applied to all the records of that heading. So, to edit the index, I start at the top and work my way from A to Z, changing the text of headings as I go along.

Most of the work of editing involves tidying up unfinished headings. The two most common cases are illustrated in the examples below.

##### **Unanalyzed Locators**

Welch, Jack, 13, 15, 31, 37  
    approach to corporate dominance, 191  
    downsizing initiative of, 51-53  
    globalization initiative of, 52-53  
    management style of, 48  
    nationalist depictions of, 52, 63n60  
    professional training of, 54-55  
    _See also_ General Electric

This entry has unanalyzed locators. To correct this, I used the function New-Child-Heading-Take-Selected-Locators (Ctl-Alt-H). When I execute the function from the heading "Welch, Jack," Sky creates a new "" subheading with the "13" locator. Then I look on page 13, analyze the passage and type the subheading text. If it is identical with another subheading text, the headings will combine and the locators merge.

##### **Too Few Subheadings**

Welch, Jack  
    as GE persona, 15  
    media glorification of, 31  
    nationalist depictions of, 13  
    status of GE labor and, 37  
    _See also_ General Electric

This entry has too few subheadings and shouldn't have any subheadings. With the highlight on "Welch, Jack" I use Consume Subheadings (Ctl-Alt-K). This function removes all subheading text in the entry but retains the locators, leaving "Welch, Jack, 13, 15, 31, 37. See also General Electric."

Overall I spend only a small proportion of the total time editing an index. The examples above are typical in that if I misjudge the importance of an entry, e.g., "Welch, Jack," I might enter four locators before I realize I need to analyze the entry and create subs. But the structure of the index -- separate headings for General Electric, globalization, nationalism, downsizing, etc. -- is established long before I reach the end. So editing consists mainly on a single pass through the index, covering a few hours, where I tidy up unfinished entries.

#### Error Scan and Proofreading

After editing, I run Error Scan from the Tools menu. I prefer to scan in stages, Cross References (top section of the dialog) first, then Questionable Entries, then Other. Usually I find a dozen or so errors, mostly locator and cross reference errors, which I correct as I go.

When I'm ready to proofread, I generate the index and open it in the word processor. With the word processor in the left pane, I zoom in so that the typeface appears grotesquely large -- this is to be able to easily spot formatting and punctuation errors. With Sky in the right pane I put the index in Edit View or in Sorted Order. Then I work my way slowly down the index, checking for errors.

#### Formatting the Index

Sky allows you to save index style settings as templates, so I have a template for each press I work with: e.g., "Indiana.tp7," "Illinois.tp7," and so on. I also have templates for hybrid index styles that I use occasionally. These are all run-in styles with differences in filing order, locator format, note format, and so on.

Because I work for university presses, I most always work directly with the author during the indexing period. I send the author a draft index for review a few days ahead of the deadline. For this purpose I use a draft style, "Draft.tp7," which is the simple indented format shown above. This makes it easier for authors to type comments in the index document.

When I receive the review back from the author, I make another round of corrections. Then I apply the house style for the press that is publishing the book, which formats the index in its final form. Now the end is near -- just one more round of proofreading in large type. When the proofing is done, I type instructions and comments at the top of the document.

Rose -

Below is the index for Foster and Grabar, Capitalism and Multinational Corporations. There are a number of things I need to bring to your attention.

According to your specs I have left titles uninverted if they begin with articles (but of course I ignored the article in sorting):

The Clash (rock music group)  
The Corporation  
The Gods Must Be Crazy

I have used hyphens (not en-dashes) for page runs according to your specs.

Special Characters -- These entries use an okina symbol (\`), which I have rendered using Unicode 2018 "Left Single Quotation Mark":

Hawai\`i  
Kamehameha III, King of Hawai\`i  
Lili\`uokalani, Queen of Hawai\`i  
ho\`omanawanui, ku\`ualoha

Special Characters -- This entry uses a Hawaiian diacritic similar to an e-macron, and I have used the Unicode e-macron for that character:

Kauanui, J. Kēhaulani, 96n10

Bose has reviewed all the Hawaiian entries. But there were some last minute changes, so I am asking her to look over the Hawaiian terms one last time and contact you if there are any further errors.

The following errors should be corrected in the text if not already corrected:

013 - "Jack Welsh" > "Welch"  
092 - "Israel Kamakawaiwole's" > Kamakawaiwo\`ole's"  
147 - "HIV/Aids" > "HIV/AIDS"  
176 - "Jose Bove" > "José Bové"

Those are all of the concerns I have. I will be out for a while this evening and also most of the morning tomorrow. Other than that I will be at your disposal in case you need anything with this index.

Thanks -  
John

When this is done, I send the index to the editor as an email attachment. Usually there is no further correspondence, and in a day or so I send out the invoice.
