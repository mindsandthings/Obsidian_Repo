When you have finished completing the indexing assignment please reflect on what you found to be most challenging about the process. How was it different from the previous two assignments? What were the most and least difficult aspects of the assignment? Is there anything that would have better prepared you for this assignment?

What kind of information were you able to find during your online research on publishers? Is this the kind of information that would impact your marketing to publishers? If so, how?

**How was it different from the previous two assignments?** 

It felt denser and more complex than the previous texts, and required more decisions about footnotes. There was also, of course, the length limit. 

**What were the most and least difficult aspects of the assignment?** 

Most difficult: ~~figuring out how to index the final 2/3 of the text with the ghost of Sylvia Coates sitting on my shoulder screaming "how dare you to try to be an indexer!"~~ Determining what was enough of a passing mention to leave out while knowing that I have neither the indexing nor the legal background to do so effectively. 

Least difficult: Indexing names. 

**Is there anything that would have better prepared you for this assignment?**

I learned during office hours that I should have read the entire article and made an outline before beginning indexing, instead of trying to follow OHIO or the professional indexers' work practices described in the lecture modules. 

It was not something I expected, but since—according to the course creator—I'm the only student the course has ever had who had to be told this, my judgment is very obviously appallingly unreliable! We can all only hope I will fail professionally despite doing moderately well in the course. 

That wasn't clear to me from the lectures or the instructions and I'm mentioning it in hopes it will help other students. (It may not; I'm told I'm the only student the course has ever had who had to be told this, but it's possible that I won't always be the only one.)


**What kind of information were you able to find during your online research on publishers? Is this the kind of information that would impact your marketing to publishers? If so, how?**

Links to all the books they publish - very useful, will let me see what kinds of material I would likely be working on and how they're published now.
