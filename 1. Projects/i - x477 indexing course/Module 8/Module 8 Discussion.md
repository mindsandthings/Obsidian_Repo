When you have finished completing the indexing assignment please reflect on what you found to be most challenging about the process. How was it different from the previous two assignments? What were the most and least difficult aspects of the assignment? Is there anything that would have better prepared you for this assignment?

What kind of information were you able to find during your online research on publishers? Is this the kind of information that would impact your marketing to publishers? If so, how?
