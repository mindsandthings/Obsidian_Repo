## _Pruning the Lengthy Index_ by Max McMaster

Max McMaster, B.Sc. (Agr.), Grad.Dip. Lib., has been a full-time freelance indexer for the past 21 years, working on more than 2,000 indexes that cover a range of subjects, including environment, business, social sciences, education, and general trade titles, but generally emphasize the sciences. He lectures on indexing to editing and publishing students at several Australian universities. A life member of the Australian and New Zealand Society of Indexers (ANZSI), he also runs indexing training courses for ANZSI and other organizations in Australia and Singapore. On three occasions, he has been awarded the AusSI (now ANZSI) Medal for book indexing.

Overindexing is a common problem with trainee indexers, however the problem really comes to the fore when index length constraints need to be applied. This cheat sheet looks at methods the indexer can take to reduce a lengthy index. Remember, any pruning will reduce the index specificity. However, when space for the index is limited, thoughtful decisions need to be made.

-   Reduce the number of subheadings by combining similar subheadings together under a broader subheading. For example, "Feeding: cattle, 34; horses, 37; pigs, 16" could be changed to "Feeding: farm animals, 16, 34, 37".
    
-   Remove subheadings altogether and move the page numbers to the main heading. For example, "Car makers in the USA: Chrysler, 24; Ford, 23; General Motors 24", could be changed to "Car makers in the USA, 23, 24".
    
-   Look at headings with only one or two locators and decide if they are essential to the index. If not, delete.
    
-   Delete passing mentions, although they should not have been included anyway.
    
-   Reduce the number of double postings, e.g. with legal cases retain the direct entry "_Smith v. Jones_" but ignore the converse "_Jones, Smith v._"
    
-   Reduce the number of cross-references. Only include _See_ and _See also_ when necessary.
    
-   Reduce the length of headings/subheadings to avoid turnover lines. For example, "Air pollution in the Seattle metropolitan area, 59–61" could be changed to "Air pollution: Seattle, 59–61" without loss of meaning.
    
-   Delete header letters or line spaces between letter groups. Retaining a header letter and the line space below it means around 50 lines (2 lines x 25 alphabet letters) will have been lost from the index, which is around a column worth of entries in 10 point text.
