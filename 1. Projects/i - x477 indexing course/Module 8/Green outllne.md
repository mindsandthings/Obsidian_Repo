# I. The Meaning of Plagiarism

- Elements
	actus res: 
	- copying [an act]
	- failing to attribute [an omission]
- mens mea: 
	- intentional/knowing; role unclear. 

## A. Plagiarism and the norm of attribution: 
- Norm of attribution: see also actus reus. 
- Disseminated in schools
	- Then internalized
		- except by cheaters who free-ride via plagiarism to gain others' esteem. 
		- Stigma is a deterrent because it denies cheaters others' esteem. 
		- Other sanctions will be discussed later. 

## B. Construction of authorship and history of plagiarism: 
- prevailing account 
	- in the classical world imitation was a preferred method of composition, and imitations were understood to be homages.
	- They were not seen as plagiarism until the Romantic Era, when:
		- the economic interests of publishers, booksellers, and authors drove changes to the law of copyright 
		- this allowed words/ideas to be viewed as property
		- which caused "authorship" and "originality" to become significant cultural values 
			- and art/literature to become viewed as the expression of the artist/writer's personality. 

- However, the author argues that
	- 1) the idea of plagiarism existed well before the Romantic Era and 2) the norm of attribution does not require the prevailing account's "strong" concept of authorship. 
	- In support of 1, the author cites etymological evidence from ancient Rome, and Jewish tradition.  

## C. The fuzzy line between plagiarism and "mere influence": 
the post-modernist critique of plagiarism is that the line is difficult to discern, and it has proposed positive terms for plagiarism. The author is skeptical but supports the main point: to some extent we absorb cultural traditions by copying; many influences are unconscious and therefore it is not realistic to attribute them all; and excessive concern with attribution is harmful to the creative process, so it is better to compare works in entirety than to look at individual instances of similarities. However, it is still useful to distinguish between (mere influence, unconscious imitation, and inadvertent failure to attribute) and extensive copying intended to convey that the copier is the original author. 

## D. Plagiarism and the question of "Mens Rea": 
some ethical codes prohibit only intentional/knowing plagiarism; others prohibit both intentional and unintentional, creating it as a "strict liability" offense; many codes prohibit unattributed copying without specifying mens rea. 

Should plagiarism require intent, or be a strict liability offense? Author argues that if theft law requires intent, then plagiarism also should—but "deliberate indifference" should count. Mistakes of fact should negate intent if reasonable; to do otherwise would cause a chilling effect. Mistake/ignorance of the law should not be an excuse, because it would encourage ignorance. 

## E. The psychology of plagiarism: 
plagiarism may be inadvertent (cryptomnesia); due to a desire to cause own self-destruction; due to elaborate self-deception; due to rational cost-benefit calculations (such as buying from an Internet cheat site), like someone who obtains money from theft or fraud instead of work. 

## F. The harms caused by, and victims of, plagiarism: 

1) the person whose words/ideas are copied and who fails to receive credit. In academia, citation contributes both to psychic rewards (others' esteem) and to monetary rewards (including career advancement and compensation). This is the flip side of defamation, where damage is done due to a commission. 
2) the reader who is deceived into believing the plagiarist was the source
3) the institution within which the plagiarism is committed. This can harm instructors and classmates, and also damage the institution's reputation and ability to get paying students and raise money. 

## G. Ghostwriters and self-plagiarists: 

* politicians and executives use speech writers, movie stars and celebrities use ghostwriters, and federal and state judges use anonymous law clerks. 
* In all of these, the actual author consents. 
	* Consent is a defense to charges of theft but not to charges of plagiarism. 
	* The real question is whether anyone is or could be harmed by such conduct. 
		* Plagiarizing students harm institution, instructor, and fellow students. 
		* In the above cases no harm is done because there is no cultural expectation that they write their own copy, so the norm of attribution has not been violated and therefore the rule against plagiarism does not apply. 
* This is also why self-plagiarism is plagiarism: because the readers are being deceived, not because of consent. 

## H. The incidence of plagiarism: 

* research shows a significant minority of high school and college students plagiarize. 
* Anecdotal evidence implies that plagiarism is 1) on the rise, in 2) many disciplines. 
* Why rise? 
1) Computer technologies (and Internet businesses) make it easier to copy
2) Changing attitudes about when the norm of attribution applies (believing Internet = "public domain" therefore okay to not attribute) and whether piracy is wrong 
3) Computer technologies and services make it easier to detect plagiarism

## I. Summary
1) Despite some apparent fraying around the edges, the rule of attribution and its corollary, the rule against plagiarism, remain a powerful pair of social norms. 
2) To be sure, there are cases in which it is difficult to distinguish between copying and mere influence, new technologies have made plagiarism easier to commit, and the very idea of “authorship” is under attack in some quarters. 
3) Nevertheless, [...] the ideas of originality and creative individuality remain a potent force, and the fear of being discovered and exposed as a plagiarist persists as a strikingly effective deterrent.

# II. Non-Legal, Quasi-Legal, and Civil Legal Sanctions for Acts That Constitute Plagiarism

## A. The Treatment of Plagiarism through informal social stigma: 

- People who violate the norm of attribution by committing plagiarism may be denied the esteem of their peers and its benefits (credit, prestige, financial reward)
- Different sub-communities treat plagiarism very differently; sometimes the alleged plagiarist becomes the victim. 
- There is a big difference between passing an entire work off as one's own and failing to attribute an occasional phrase or sentence. 
- Copying verbatim may be more objectionable than merely paraphrasing. 
- More prominent plagiarists or victims may elicit more attention. 
- Specific communities:
	- The scientific community has little tolerance. 
	- Journalists and newspaper editors are treated more leniently. 
	- Law scholarship involves elaborate cite checking rituals, but is not subject to peer review. 
	- In literature, it varies greatly. 
- Why community differences? 
	- The extent to which it's copying vs inspiration
	- The identity of the victim (e.g., a live victim who defends themself vs dead writers)
	- The dynamics of the discipline.
		- Only original resaerch can further the goal of hte sciences
		- Popular historians (unlike academic historians) are not necessarily expected to plow new ground
		- Journalism involves multiple journalists covering the same stories with tight deadlines while relying on a limited number of similar sources; originality isn't that important

## B. Plagiarism as a formally sanctioned, institutionally enforced, ethical violation

- Plagiarism is generally investigated, adjudicated, and punished by educational and professional institutions in private.
- Codes of academic and professional ethics prohibit plagiarism (though most news orgs don't have these). 
- Violation can lead to failure, suspension, expulsion; dismissal; censure or revocation of licenses. 
- Litigation concerning this sort of plagiarism almost always involves:
	- Due-process claims brought by alleged plagiarists challenging the procedures
	- Defamation cases brought by alleged plagiarists against their accusers
- How is the "private justice" paradigm maintained? 
	- Students, employees, and members voluntarily submit to the rules
	- These institutions tend to have special expertise detecting and dealing with plagiarism
	- These institutions tend to have the most direct interest in preserving the values that plagiarism threatens

## Civil legal remedies for acts that  constitute plagiarism

Unattributed copying can constitute one or more of a variety of legal wrongs.

### Plagiarism as copyright infringement
- There is significant overlap between the two, but they are distinct. 
- Plagiarism fails to constitute copyright infringement under the Federal Copyright Act when:
	-  it involves work that has an expired copyright, is in the public domain, or was written by a U.S. government employee. 
	-  it does not involve specific language being copied (only the "expression" is protected)
	- the "fair use" doctrine allows certain limited uses of copyright material, but plagiarism has no analogous exception
- Cases of copyright infringement do not always constitue plagiarism
	- plagiarism always involves passing off
	- copying copyrighted work is copyright infringement even if attributed
	- unlike plagiarism, lack of intent s no defense to a (civil) claim of copyright infringement; unconscious infringement is still infringement
- Why do plagiarism and copyright diverge? 
	- They protect different kinds of interests
	- Copyright law protects a primarliy economic interest
	- The rule against plagiarism protects a person, or moral, interest
	- Copyright demands one obtain formal permission to copy; the rule against plagiarism assumes the writer gives permission to copy with proper attribution


### Plagiarism as unfair competition
- The area of tort law known as unfair competition law has 2 relevant doctrines:
	- Reverse palming (or passing) off
	- Misappropriation
- Palming off: selling goods under a better-known competitor's name
	- Reverse palming off: selling their goods under your name
		- Express reverse palming off: selling under your name
		- Implied reverse palming off: selling a competitor's product unlabeled
	- Actionable under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Actc
	- Analogy with plagiarism: taking another's words or ideas, removing the other party's name, and representing the words or ideas as one's own
		- Rationale is the same: damages your ability to get credit and sell your services
- Misappropriation: 
	- establishes tort protection for intangible "quasi-property" such as ideas, information, designs, etc
	- Premised on the notion that a commercial rival shoudl not be allowed to profit unfairly from your work
	- Internaional News Services/Associated Press example: how the concepts of "misappropri9ation" and "quasi-property right" were created
		- However this has serious problems. 
			- Was established before Erie Railroad Co. v Tompkins and therefore is no longer binding. 
			- Two justices expressed strong dissernts. 
			- Has been strongly criticized by the Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition, other judges, and various academic commentators
			- A suit for misappropriation is also exceedling difficult to win
				- requires plaintiff to show that:
					- he invested a substantial amt of time, effort, and money
					- the defendant appropriated it at little or no cost
					- defendent was injured by it typically by a direct diversion or royalties or other profits from plaintiff to defendant
						- this is the hardest to satisfy because in many cases there are no profits to be diverted
							- however author's point is that it's reaping where you didn't sow that resonantes with plagiarism
	- 

### Plagiarism as a violation of the European doctrine of moral rights
- 3 basic parts
	- The right of integrity: prevents others from destroying/altering an artist's work without their permission
	- The right of disclosure: the right to decide when a given work is completed and when, if ever, it will be disxplayed, performed, or published
	- The right of attribution (or paternity): 
		- most relevant right in the context of plagiarism
		- both pos and neg: right to be identified as author of any work created, and to prevent use of name as author of work did not create 
- Recognized most prominently in Article 6bis of the Berne Convention for the protection of Literary and Artistic Rights
	- More limited in teh US, with virtually no application to literary works. 
		- However, 1990 Visual Aritsts' Rights Act provides more limited rights of integrity and attribution
		- A number of states have enacted legislation analogous to European moral rights
- Moral rights are often described as "personality-based" rights
	- can't be bought or sold, do not extend much beyond the artist's life, and (under French law) are "inalienable and imprescriptable"
	- Intended to protect interests that transcend the marketplace, such as in reputation and honor.
		- This makes these rights closer to the interests protected by the rule against plagiarism than  they are to the interests protected by intellectual property law or unfair competition law

# Plagiarism and the law of theft

3 basic elements comprise the modern offense of theft:
1) Unlawful taking or exercising unlawful control over
2) Movable property of another
3) With the intent of depriving the owner of such property

## A. Does plagiarism involve the taking of "property"?

### 1. What kinds of things are "property" for the purposes of theft law?
- A resource considered property for one kind of law may not be for another

#### a. Theft law in historical perspective:
- 
- Has expanded on two axes:
	- the types of interference that constitute theft
	- the kinds of property that can be stolen
- Types of interference: 
	- Early theft law was concerned with preserving social order and preventing violence
		- It was assumed the criminality of the deed had to become manifest in a single brief moment of force or stealth
		- As it developed the requirement of manifestness waned, and other kinds of taking were criminalized (false pretenses, embezzlement)
			- Physical possession was no longer relevant
			- Shifted from force/stealth focus to intentional acquisition of property by virtually any dishonest means
- The definition of what constitutes property: 
	- Early, meant tangible and movable (goods and chattel) but not real/intangible (a ride on a train, a roomat a hotel, a deed, stocks)
	- Changed by the 19th century
		- why?
			- intangible property became more economically important


#### b. Theft Law and Property Today
- different jurisdictions define it differently

###### i. theft law and intangibles
- the most influential defintiion of property is in teh Model Penal Code (MPC)
	- but it's a circular definition
	- the MPC commentary defines property as "anythin that is part of one person's wealth and that anothe rperson can appropriate"
- some courts are reluctant to treat certain kinds of intangibles as a "thing of value"
	- example of Stewart v. the Queen
	- why? 
		- at an intuitive level people distinguish between property rights in physical objects and those in intangibles
			- why?
				- some people usggest it's because you don't lose actual use of a good 
					- but you are depriving people of royalties
				- maybe it's that in some cases it's harder to prove it was stolen
				- or because the theft is more likely to be unintentional
				- but maybe the important thing is to ask not what proprety theft law protects but what kinds of rights or interests theft law is meant to protect
					- e.g. state video poker machine licenses are for regulatory reasons not economic ones
					- what interests does the law of theft protect? "thick" property rights
						- 1) possession, use adn enjoyment; 2) rights of transfer; 3) rights to exclude others
					- how about copyright law? "thin" property rights
						- toprovide economic incentives to create information and a shelter to develop and protect it
					- moral rights: "thin" in a different way: personal, artistic, noneconomic
					- theft law:
						- differs from copyright law by having no exclusion for fair use
						- differs from doctrine of moral rights by focusin on the general interests of society instead of the individual artist
						- theft law provides a broadly sweeping, general purpose safety net, applying even when other more specialized doctrines of law do not

###### Theft Law and Commodification
- Not every "thing of value" can be the subject of theft
	- Kidnapping a child is kidnapping, not theft; children cannot be property or owned
	- Terrorists can steal a sens eof security but cannot be prosecuted for theft; a sense of security is not bought or sold
	- This suggests somethign can be a a "thing of value" for theft law only if it is commodifiable
- Commidifiable: 
	- term usually comes up in the context of debate over whether to permit sale of thigns like sex, reproductive capacity, and bodily organs
	- law and economics and libertarian scholars offer that we should commodify broadly because markets offer an efficient means of distributing scarce resources
	- liberal theorists argue commidification undermines important social values like personal dignity and social justice
	- commodifiability also comes up in intellectual property law, when seeking to explain what info should be subjet to legal protection
	- three kind of NON-commodifiability:
		- 1) things that are illegal to possess
		- 2) things that are not illegal to possess but are illegal to buy and sell (like organs)
		- 3) things that are not illegal to buy, sell, or possess, but aren't capable of being bought or sold (love, admiration, respect)
	- author's claim: a thing is not subject to theft unless it is the sort of thing that can be bought or sold (legally or not).
