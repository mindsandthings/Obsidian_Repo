# I. The Meaning of Plagiarism

- Elements
	actus res: 
	- copying [an act]
	- failing to attribute [an omission]
- mens mea: 
	- intentional/knowing; role unclear. 

## A. Plagiarism and the norm of attribution: 
- Norm of attribution: see also actus reus. 
- Disseminated in schools
	- Then internalized
		- except by cheaters who free-ride via plagiarism to gain others' esteem. 
		- Stigma is a deterrent because it denies cheaters others' esteem. 
		- Other sanctions will be discussed later. 

## B. Construction of authorship and history of plagiarism: 
- prevailing account 
	- in the classical world imitation was a preferred method of composition, and imitations were understood to be homages.
	- They were not seen as plagiarism until the Romantic Era, when:
		- the economic interests of publishers, booksellers, and authors drove changes to the law of copyright 
		- this allowed words/ideas to be viewed as property
		- which caused "authorship" and "originality" to become significant cultural values 
			- and art/literature to become viewed as the expression of the artist/writer's personality. 

- However, the author argues that
	- 1) the idea of plagiarism existed well before the Romantic Era and 2) the norm of attribution does not require the prevailing account's "strong" concept of authorship. 
	- In support of 1, the author cites etymological evidence from ancient Rome, and Jewish tradition.  

## C. The fuzzy line between plagiarism and "mere influence": 
the post-modernist critique of plagiarism is that the line is difficult to discern, and it has proposed positive terms for plagiarism. The author is skeptical but supports the main point: to some extent we absorb cultural traditions by copying; many influences are unconscious and therefore it is not realistic to attribute them all; and excessive concern with attribution is harmful to the creative process, so it is better to compare works in entirety than to look at individual instances of similarities. However, it is still useful to distinguish between (mere influence, unconscious imitation, and inadvertent failure to attribute) and extensive copying intended to convey that the copier is the original author. 

## D. Plagiarism and the question of "Mens Rea": 
some ethical codes prohibit only intentional/knowing plagiarism; others prohibit both intentional and unintentional, creating it as a "strict liability" offense; many codes prohibit unattributed copying without specifying mens rea. 

Should plagiarism require intent, or be a strict liability offense? Author argues that if theft law requires intent, then plagiarism also should—but "deliberate indifference" should count. Mistakes of fact should negate intent if reasonable; to do otherwise would cause a chilling effect. Mistake/ignorance of the law should not be an excuse, because it would encourage ignorance. 

## E. The psychology of plagiarism: 
plagiarism may be inadvertent (cryptomnesia); due to a desire to cause own self-destruction; due to elaborate self-deception; due to rational cost-benefit calculations (such as buying from an Internet cheat site), like someone who obtains money from theft or fraud instead of work. 

## F. The harms caused by, and victims of, plagiarism: 

1) the person whose words/ideas are copied and who fails to receive credit. In academia, citation contributes both to psychic rewards (others' esteem) and to monetary rewards (including career advancement and compensation). This is the flip side of defamation, where damage is done due to a commission. 
2) the reader who is deceived into believing the plagiarist was the source
3) the institution within which the plagiarism is committed. This can harm instructors and classmates, and also damage the institution's reputation and ability to get paying students and raise money. 

## G. Ghostwriters and self-plagiarists: 

* politicians and executives use speech writers, movie stars and celebrities use ghostwriters, and federal and state judges use anonymous law clerks. 
* In all of these, the actual author consents. 
	* Consent is a defense to charges of theft but not to charges of plagiarism. 
	* The real question is whether anyone is or could be harmed by such conduct. 
		* Plagiarizing students harm institution, instructor, and fellow students. 
		* In the above cases no harm is done because there is no cultural expectation that they write their own copy, so the norm of attribution has not been violated and therefore the rule against plagiarism does not apply. 
* This is also why self-plagiarism is plagiarism: because the readers are being deceived, not because of consent. 

## H. The incidence of plagiarism: 

* research shows a significant minority of high school and college students plagiarize. 
* Anecdotal evidence implies that plagiarism is 1) on the rise, in 2) many disciplines. 
* Why rise? 
1) Computer technologies (and Internet businesses) make it easier to copy
2) Changing attitudes about when the norm of attribution applies (believing Internet = "public domain" therefore okay to not attribute) and whether piracy is wrong 
3) Computer technologies and services make it easier to detect plagiarism

## I. Summary
1) Despite some apparent fraying around the edges, the rule of attribution and its corollary, the rule against plagiarism, remain a powerful pair of social norms. 
2) To be sure, there are cases in which it is difficult to distinguish between copying and mere influence, new technologies have made plagiarism easier to commit, and the very idea of “authorship” is under attack in some quarters. 
3) Nevertheless, [...] the ideas of originality and creative individuality remain a potent force, and the fear of being discovered and exposed as a plagiarist persists as a strikingly effective deterrent.

# II. Non-Legal, Quasi-Legal, and Civil Legal Sanctions for Acts That Constitute Plagiarism

## A. The Treatment of Plagiarism through informal social stigma: 

- People who violate the norm of attribution by committing plagiarism may be denied the esteem of their peers and its benefits (credit, prestige, financial reward)
- Different sub-communities treat plagiarism very differently; sometimes the alleged plagiarist becomes the victim. 
- There is a big difference between passing an entire work off as one's own and failing to attribute an occasional phrase or sentence. 
- Copying verbatim may be more objectionable than merely paraphrasing. 
- More prominent plagiarists or victims may elicit more attention. 
- Specific communities:
	- The scientific community has little tolerance. 
	- Journalists and newspaper editors are treated more leniently. 
	- Law scholarship involves elaborate cite checking rituals, but is not subject to peer review. 
	- In literature, it varies greatly. 
- Why community differences? 
	- The extent to which it's copying vs inspiration
	- The identity of the victim (e.g., a live victim who defends themself vs dead writers)
	- The dynamics of the discipline.
		- Only original resaerch can further the goal of hte sciences
		- Popular historians (unlike academic historians) are not necessarily expected to plow new ground
		- Journalism involves multiple journalists covering the same stories with tight deadlines while relying on a limited number of similar sources; originality isn't that important

## B. Plagiarism as a formally sanctioned, institutionally enforced, ethical violation

- Plagiarism is generally investigated, adjudicated, and punished by educational and professional institutions in private.
- Codes of academic and professional ethics prohibit plagiarism (though most news orgs don't have these). 
- Violation can lead to failure, suspension, expulsion; dismissal; censure or revocation of licenses. 
- Litigation concerning this sort of plagiarism almost always involves:
	- Due-process claims brought by alleged plagiarists challenging the procedures
	- Defamation cases brought by alleged plagiarists against their accusers
- How is the "private justice" paradigm maintained? 
	- Students, employees, and members voluntarily submit to the rules
	- These institutions tend to have special expertise detecting and dealing with plagiarism
	- These institutions tend to have the most direct interest in preserving the values that plagiarism threatens

## Civil legal remedies for acts that  constitute plagiarism

Unattributed copying can constitute one or more of a variety of legal wrongs.

### Plagiarism as copyright infringement
- There is significant overlap between the two, but they are distinct. 
- Plagiarism fails to constitute copyright infringement under the Federal Copyright Act when:
	-  it involves work that has an expired copyright, is in the public domain, or was written by a U.S. government employee. 
	-  it does not involve specific language being copied (only the "expression" is protected)
	- the "fair use" doctrine allows certain limited uses of copyright material, but plagiarism has no analogous exception
- Cases of copyright infringement do not always constitue plagiarism
	- plagiarism always involves passing off
	- copying copyrighted work is copyright infringement even if attributed
	- unlike plagiarism, lack of intent s no defense to a (civil) claim of copyright infringement; unconscious infringement is still infringement
- Why do plagiarism and copyright diverge? 
	- They protect different kinds of interests
	- Copyright law protects a primarliy economic interest
	- The rule against plagiarism protects a person, or moral, interest
	- Copyright demands one obtain formal permission to copy; the rule against plagiarism assumes the writer gives permission to copy with proper attribution


### Plagiarism as unfair competition
- The area of tort law known as unfair competition law has 2 relevant doctrines:
	- Reverse palming (or passing) off
	- Misappropriation
- Palming off: selling goods under a better-known competitor's name
	- Reverse palming off: selling their goods under your name
		- Express reverse palming off: selling under your name
		- Implied reverse palming off: selling a competitor's product unlabeled
	- Actionable under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Actc
	- Analogy with plagiarism: taking another's words or ideas, removing the other party's name, and representing the words or ideas as one's own
		- Rationale is the same: damages your ability to get credit and sell your services
- Misappropriation: 
	- establishes tort protection for intangible "quasi-property" such as ideas, information, designs, etc
	- Premised on the notion that a commercial rival shoudl not be allowed to profit unfairly from your work
	- Internaional News Services/Associated Press example: how the concepts of "misappropri9ation" and "quasi-property right" were created
		- However this has serious problems. 
			- Was established before Erie Railroad Co. v Tompkins and therefore is no longer binding. 
			- Two justices expressed strong dissernts. 
			- Has been strongly criticized by the Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition, other judges, and various academic commentators
			- A suit for misappropriation is also exceedling difficult to win
				- requires plaintiff to show that:
					- he invested a substantial amt of time, effort, and money
					- the defendant appropriated it at little or no cost
					- defendent was injured by it typically by a direct diversion or royalties or other profits from plaintiff to defendant
						- this is the hardest to satisfy because in many cases there are no profits to be diverted
							- however author's point is that it's reaping where you didn't sow that resonantes with plagiarism
	- 

### Plagiarism as a violation of the European doctrine of moral rights
- 3 basic parts
	- The right of integrity: prevents others from destroying/altering an artist's work without their permission
	- The right of disclosure: the right to decide when a given work is completed and when, if ever, it will be disxplayed, performed, or published
	- The right of attribution (or paternity): 
		- most relevant right in the context of plagiarism
		- both pos and neg: right to be identified as author of any work created, and to prevent use of name as author of work did not create 
- Recognized most prominently in Article 6bis of the Berne Convention for the protection of Literary and Artistic Rights
	- More limited in teh US, with virtually no application to literary works. 
		- However, 1990 Visual Aritsts' Rights Act provides more limited rights of integrity and attribution
		- A number of states have enacted legislation analogous to European moral rights
- Moral rights are often described as "personality-based" rights
	- can't be bought or sold, do not extend much beyond the artist's life, and (under French law) are "inalienable and imprescriptable"
	- Intended to protect interests that transcend the marketplace, such as in reputation and honor.
		- This makes these rights closer to the interests protected by the rule against plagiarism than  they are to the interests protected by intellectual property law or unfair competition law
		- 


# Plagiarism and the law of theft

3 basic elements comprise the modern offense of theft:
1) Unlawful taking or exercising unlawful control over
2) Movable property of another
3) With the intent of depriving the owner of such property

## A. Does plagiarism involve the taking of "property"?

### 1. What kinds of things are "property" for the purposes of theft law?
- A resource considered property for one kind of law may not be for another

#### a. Theft law in historical perspective:
- Has expanded on two axes:
	- the types of interference that constitute theft
	- the kinds of property that can be stolen
- Types of interference: 
	- Early theft law was concerned with preserving social order and preventing violence
		- It was assumed the criminality of the deed had to become manifest in a single brief moment of force or stealth
		- As it developed the requirement of manifestness waned, and other kinds of taking were criminalized (false pretenses, embezzlement)
			- Physical possession was no longer relevant
			- Shifted from force/stealth focus to intentional acquisition of property by virtually any dishonest means
- The definition of what constitutes property: 
	- Early, meant tangible and movable (goods and chattel) but not real/intangible (a ride on a train, a roomat a hotel, a deed, stocks)
	- Changed by the 19th century
		- why?
			- intangible property became more economically important


#### b. Theft Law and Property Today
- different jurisdictions define it differently

###### i. theft law and intangibles
- the most influential defintiion of property is in teh Model Penal Code (MPC)
	- but it's a circular definition
	- the MPC commentary defines property as "anythin that is part of one person's wealth and that anothe rperson can appropriate"
- some courts are reluctant to treat certain kinds of intangibles as a "thing of value"
	- example of Stewart v. the Queen
	- why? 
		- at an intuitive level people distinguish between property rights in physical objects and those in intangibles
			- why?
				- some people usggest it's because you don't lose actual use of a good 
					- but you are depriving people of royalties
				- maybe it's that in some cases it's harder to prove it was stolen
				- or because the theft is more likely to be unintentional
				- but maybe the important thing is to ask not what proprety theft law protects but what kinds of rights or interests theft law is meant to protect
					- e.g. state video poker machine licenses are for regulatory reasons not economic ones
					- what interests does the law of theft protect? "thick" property rights
						- 1) possession, use adn enjoyment; 2) rights of transfer; 3) rights to exclude others
					- how about copyright law? "thin" property rights
						- toprovide economic incentives to create information and a shelter to develop and protect it
					- moral rights: "thin" in a different way: personal, artistic, noneconomic
					- theft law:
						- differs from copyright law by having no exclusion for fair use
						- differs from doctrine of moral rights by focusin on the general interests of society instead of the individual artist
						- theft law provides a broadly sweeping, general purpose safety net, applying even when other more specialized doctrines of law do not

###### Theft Law and Commodification
- Not every "thing of value" can be the subject of theft
	- Kidnapping a child is kidnapping, not theft; children cannot be property or owned
	- Terrorists can steal a sens eof security but cannot be prosecuted for theft; a sense of security is not bought or sold
	- This suggests somethign can be a a "thing of value" for theft law only if it is commodifiable
- Commidifiable: 
	- term usually comes up in the context of debate over whether to permit sale of thigns like sex, reproductive capacity, and bodily organs
	- law and economics and libertarian scholars offer that we should commodify broadly because markets offer an efficient means of distributing scarce resources
	- liberal theorists argue commidification undermines important social values like personal dignity and social justice
	- commodifiability also comes up in intellectual property law, when seeking to explain what info should be subjet to legal protection
	- three kind of NON-commodifiability:
		- 1) things that are illegal to possess
		- 2) things that are not illegal to possess but are illegal to buy and sell (like organs)
		- 3) things that are not illegal to buy, sell, or possess, but aren't capable of being bought or sold (love, admiration, respect)
	- author's claim: a thing is not subject to theft unless it is the sort of thing that can be bought or sold (legally or not).

### What, if anything, does the plagiarist steal?
- The author's presentation of ideas = conditional offer that anyone may read/quote/take ideas provided they attribute (i.e., provide credit)
- Plagiarism often seen as theft of words/language/plot, but author argues that what is stolen is credit
- "misappropriation of glory"

### Is "credit" for authorship a "thing of value" within the meaning of theft law?
- i.e., is credit commodifiable?
- most writers have an interest in receiving public credit for their work (despite exceptions e.g. ghostwriters)
	- psychic rewards are significant, sometimes more so than financial compensation
- recognition and development of a reputation results in signifcant tangible rewards, such as tenure and promotion etc
	- in some academia, citation is used to rank people
- but is it commodifiable? 
	- yes, but a close question
	- e.g. politician/exec is paying ghostwriter both for efforts and for right to claim speech as own and gain right to honor/blame
	- credit can actually be stolen, e.g. in submitting a prizewinning idea, and that is theft
	- but. do we really want to say that having someone else claim credit is a crime? 

## Does plagiarism involve an "intent to deprive another permanently" of property?

- This is another requirement of theft law
- General rule: defendent not guilty until he takes another's property with the intent to deprive them permanently of it (animus furandi)
- Plagiarism is broader than theft law herE: it is also concerned with harm to the reader and to institutions. But theft law would fin dthat irrelevant. 

## Does plagiarism involve an "unlawful taking" or exercise of "unlawful control" over property "of another"?

- "unlawfully take or exercise unlawful control" over property "of another" - replaces common law larceny requirements of "caption" (securing dominion over another's property) and "asportation" (carrying away of the other's property)
- "exercises unlawful control" = using in a manner beyon dyour authority
	- this is what a plagiarist does at th emoment of publication
	- what about when the person consents? (ghostwriting, self-plagiarism, buying papers)
		- yes, this makes the taking not unlawful
		- 

## WOuld prosecution of plagiarism as theft be preempted by federal copyright law?

- (obviously, there would be no bar to prosecuting plagiarism of works that don't constitue copyright infringement)
- Section 301 of hte Copyright Act prevents state legal remedies that don't have an extra element making it qualitatively different from a copyright infringement claim
	- so would a state law prosecution for plagiarism as theft include an extra element to make it qualitatively dfiferent? 
		- yes, because it involves passing off someone's work as one's own (aka stealing credit)
			- analagous to a state law unfair competition suit based on a claim of "passing off"
		- but...preemptive effect of Section 301 has been interpreted very broadly. so neithe rpassing off nor mens rea may be enough
		- case law concerning two federal Copyright Act preclusion of federal ones:
			- govt tried to prosecute copying of copyrighted musical recordings under Section 2314 of the National Stolen Property Act, but the Court agreed with defendant the Act didn't apply
			- US v LaMacchia: couldn't charge him for unauthorized copying because the Copyright Act required it be undertaken for commercial advantage or private financial gain, so he was charged with violating the federal wire fraud statute instead; the Court distmissed it, saying generic criminal laws shouldn't be used to undermine the "finely calibrated" Copyright Act
		- so yes, state law prosection for plagiarism as theft would be preempted by federal law, if only to the extent it invovled opyrighted materials
		- 
## Summary
- To prove theft, must demostrate: 1) unlawful taking or exercise of control ove,r 2) movable property, 3) with the intent to deprive the owner of such property
- Author's argument: Not all cases involve both an unlawful taking and intent to deprive
	- but harder issue is whether "credit" is property that can be subjct to theft
	- argues there is a credible though not airtight arugment that credit for words or ides is a thing of value within the meaning of theft law
	- so if not preempted by federal copyright law, could be prosecuted as theft


# IV. Prosecuting plagiarism as theft as a matter of public policy and broader criminal law principles

- Would prposecuting plagiarism as theft be wasteful? 
- Would it be consistent with the larger aims of the criminal law, such as deterrence and retribution? 
- 
## Would the criminal prosection of plagiarism constitute an unwise use of government resources?
- It's probably more common, but is the increase sufficient to justify? 
	- Criminial law is supposed to be a last resort
		- Institutions could try harder to inform constituents
		- Profs/editors could pursue offenders more aggressively
		- Disciplimary committees could icrease the penalties
	- Distinguishing between intentional and unintentional plagiarism is difficult and could lead to arbirrary adn unprincipled enforcement
	- "Credit" is not a tangible property with concrete, physical boundaries, raising questions of legality and overbreadth
- Argument sin response:
	- 1) it wouldn't involve new legislation, just using existing legislation, so the question should be is there justifcation for *not* prosecuting conduct that satisfies the elements of theft
	- 2) some acts of plagiarism are no less harmful than other cases of theft that are prosectued (gives examples)
		- Many victims would probably choose having their wallet stolen over being plagiariazed
		- just because some are too trivial to prosecute doesn't mean they all are
	- 3) the existence of institutional mechanisms and civil sanctions for workpale and academic misconduct isn't a basis for barring criminal prosecution
		- "Criminal punishment entails expressiv values that are not entailed by other kinds of sactions"
	- Summary:
		- author is suggesting not that we *should* prosecute plagiarism as theft, but that it's more complciated than may appear
		- we should let prosecutors decide whether to prosecute individual cases, but it shoul be the legislature that decides whether to prosecute whole categories of cases
		- so if plagiarism satisfies the elements of theft and we don't want to treat it as such as need to find a principled reason to read it out of theft law, or theft law needs to be rewritten
	- 

## Woudl the prosectuion of plagiarism as theft be consistent with teh underlying goals of theft law? 

- Deeper question: What is the underlying rationale for considering theft a crimEe?
- 1) Deterrence
	- promote security of property by threatening aggressors with punishment, because the community wishes to encourage saving and economic planning
		- but this applies to intangibles too!
		- and why impose punishment rather than just require repayment (tort-like remedies)? 
			- many thieves are udgment proof
			- and not every thief will be apprehended
			- so you need to adjust the costs to reflect the probability of conviction
			- punishment is a "kicker" to pay on top of compensation, to incentivize acquiring through the market instead
		- this is what prosecuting plagiarism as theft would do, but is it really so harmful we want to use criminal law to deter it? does it threaten property security?
			- probably not. rampant plagiarism would destabilize intelligentsia but not the larger community, so we should let institutions police themselves
			- also, plagiarism is hard to distinguish from lawful and even socially productive conduct; could lead to overdeterrence, causing writers to forgo creative endeavors
	- 
- 2) Retribution
	- from a retributivist perspective theft is a crime because it expresses disrespect for the injured party's moral worth
	- in the relevant community, plagiarism conveys extreme disrespect
	- but outside that community people think it's troubling to think it deserves criminal sanctions
	- and plagiarism is of concern primarily to a relatively small segment of society

# Plagiarism as theft and the criminalization of intellectual property law
- Rapid growth in legislative enactments of intellectual property in criminal law
	- list of examples
- This doesn't seem surprising because intellectual property plays an increasingly significant role in teh economy
	- and people who have discussed using criminal sanctiosn for intellectual property violations have assumed that the more violations there are the stronger the case for imposing sanctions
		- but...there's a remarkable degree of resistance to such laws
			- over half of all colelge students use illegal software
			- 50-90% of software is unauthorized
			- other examples
		- will discuss two things
			- gap between criminal law and norms concerning misappropriation of intellectual property
			- whether the appropriate paradigm for intellectual proeprty crime is theft vs something else (infringement, false marking, counterfeiting, forgery, regulatory violation)
## A. The gap between social norms and intellectual property crime legislation
- People don't refrain from committing criminal acts out of fear of sanctions, but because they've internalized the norms against them (the prohibitive norms are "robust")
- In intellectual property, they're not robust, because people copy videotapes and download bootleg computer programs
- Why?
	- can't be just intangibility, because people who will copy videotapes are still against plagiarism
	- the difference between attitutdes towards the norm of attribution and against plagiarism, and intellectual property law, is a paradox - they view the rule against plagiarism as closely approximating the force of law
	- th eproblem of perceived illegitimacy is as important as intangibility: the perception that IP laws are intended to create profits for special interest groups
	- so if the state wants to enforce IP laws it needs to convince the public that misappropriation of intellectual property is morally wrong (if it is) and that the laws prohibiting it are legitimate
	- people can relate to the potential victims of plagiarism. if they thought downloading illegally would hurt artists, they'd do it less

## Intellectual property crime and the paradigm of theft

- The idea that IP should be protected by theft law seems to crop up all over
- the Economic Espionage Act, the National Stolen Propety Act, the No Electronic Theft Act - in common a literal commitment to the idea that IP is subject to theft or being stolen
- but other paradigms apply, not just theft. 
- difficult to see why Congress chose to use the paradigm of theft
	- from the perspective of IP law, referring to copyright or patent violations as "theft" may seem inconsistent with the idea of "infringement" and "false marking" as *sui generis*
	- from the perspective of criminal law, "theft" and "stealing" have particular expressive and moral resonances that are unlikely to find easy equivalence in IP law

# Conclusion
- Plagiarism never has been and probably never should be prosectued as theft
- Why's it of interest to people interested in criminal law?
	- Criminal law can elucidate our understanding of plagiarism (_(through the use of concepts such as__intent, willful ignorance, consent, harm, and the distinction between__mistake of law and mistake of fact)_)
	- the concept of plagiarism can help us understan dimportant issues in criminal law itself, including what kinds of "peroperty" can be subject o theft
- Plagiarism is interesting beyond criminal law
	- unattributed copying is addressed by a remarkably broad range of civil rememdies, including copyright, unfair competition,a dn moral rights. 
	- analysis has been to illustrate the ubiquity of the social norms underlying the rule against plagiariams and the breadth of means through which such normsm are enforced
- Effective law is the product of effective norms
	- as the gap between the law and what people think it shoudl be widens, IP law faces a growing crisis, manifesting in widespread and flagrant violation ofi ts contstraints
	- but the norm-based rule of attribution is still viewed by people within the relevant communities as imposing a powerrul moral imperative
	- so as we try to improve IP law we should look to normative structures surrounding plagiarism for guidance
