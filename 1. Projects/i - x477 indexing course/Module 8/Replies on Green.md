Hi, Elizabeth,  
  
My apologies for the delay in getting back to you. I was away on a business trip, and only got back last night.  
  
I've pasted your questions below, as this email system doesn't allow me to see them in the email composition window otherwise. I've inserted responses after the questions, after the ***.  
  
Best,  
Kendra  
  
Questions:  
  
1. Do you want a letter heading or extra space between alphabetic groups in the index (as opposed to no heading and no space)?  
  
*** When no specific instructions are provided regarding the alphabet separators, it's really up to you. Common practice is to at least have a space between letter groupings. Keep in mind, however, that you have a very tight line limit for this assignment. If you choose to add alphabet separators, you are using quite a few lines for that.  
  
2. I have italicized case names in the index as they are italicized in the text (*Ruckelshaus* v. *Monsanto*); please let me know if you prefer a different format.  
  
*** Unless otherwise instructed, following the text is the way to go.  
  
3. Do you want case law citations double-posted under both plaintiff and defendant? e.g., "*Brogan* v. *United States*" and "*United States*, *Brogan* v.". If so, the question comes up of whether to include a separate name entry for the plaintiff and/or defendant if named separately in the text (as is the case for LaMacchia on page 227) or if discussed in the text but only as "the plaintiff" (203) or "the submitter (214). My inclination is to double-post cases and include a page range for the discussion, but not a separate name entry just for the actual person being discussed.  
  
*** There is no right or wrong here. However, your choices will be influenced by the space constraint. If you had no space limit, then posting under both plaintiff and defendant would be an option, as would having both case and personal name entries. You may decide that these are important enough that they deserve the space, which will mean something else will need to be left out. Or you may decide that you need to limit duplication as much as possible so that you have room for additional topics. Working through the rationale for different choices is an important part of learning to work within these types of constraints.  
  
4. Do you want all names of fictional characters included in the index as well? There are seven of these: Christian, Roxane, and Cyrano de Bergerac from the play Cyrano de Bergerac (discussed in 189n85), Stewart Church (187), Cal Cunningham (187), Peter Gibson (186-187), and Gregory Keays (186-187). The material for all seven is already accessible under the names of the associated authors (and when relevant, the plagiarist's).  
  
*** Again, there is no inherently right or wrong answer. In some instances, it may be important to index fictional characters, but in others not. Think about your audience. Will law students and legal scholars have a need/desire to locate information based on the character, or is the topic they are illustrating the more salient point? As above, if there were no space limit, you could include both. Given the limit, you may very well decide to exclude entries that you deem to be less relevant to the intended audience.  
  
5. Ordinarily, I would not include passing mentions as part of hypothetical examples. For example: "What is the point of finding new words to describe Einstein's Theory of Relativity" (180-181) and "bootleg copies of a Richard Russo novel, Steven Soderbergh film, or Alison Krauss & Union Station CD" (201). Einstein, Richard Russo, Steven Soderbergh, and Alison Krauss's names are in the text here, but they used as ad hoc hypothetical examples in passing, so ordinarily I would not include them in an index. Please let me know if you would like them included anyway.  
  
*** Although the instructions tell you to include all names in the text, I would follow your instincts here. These are not truly discussions of these people. You could insert almost any name as an example without changing the underlying meaning of the text.  
  
Individual name issues:  
  
*** Regarding the various name-specific issues, I don't actually have any more information than you do, as I only have the text to work with. From the below, it seems to me that you are following good practice, i.e., following the text with regard to spelling alternatives, and noting actual errors. You can submit the list of discrepancies/first name additions when you submit the index, just as you would send this information to an editor if this were a for-hire project.  
  
1. Talmudic scholar Isaac Abarbanel (176): name authorities (VIAF and the Library of Congress) prefer the spelling Isaac Abravanel. **I have gone with Abarbanel for now, as it is in the text; please let me know if you would like Abravanel instead.**  
2. The "e" has been omitted from "Deane" for Deane Malott (more properly Deane Waldo Malott, president of Cornell University (180n47). Although he did serve at one point as an assistant dean, the note refers to events during his time as president. **I have used "Mallott, Deane Waldo" in the index.**  
3. Joe Balkoski (188): the source cites him as Joe, but he publishes under Joseph Balkoski (see his Amazon page: [https://www.amazon.com/Joseph-Balkoski/e/B001JS6IIA%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share](https://www.amazon.com/Joseph-Balkoski/e/B001JS6IIA%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share); here is an article identifying that Joseph Balkoski, author of Beyond the Beachhead, as the one who Ambrose plagiarized: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2002/01/11/stephen-ambrose-and-the-rights-of-passage/0f1ced66-d9f9-4c63-b18f-55b7dfbf1a78/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2002/01/11/stephen-ambrose-and-the-rights-of-passage/0f1ced66-d9f9-4c63-b18f-55b7dfbf1a78/)). **I have used Joseph in the index; please let me know if you would like me to do otherwise.**  
4. 191n93: the article is cited as Donald McCabe, but it was published under Donald L. McCabe (see [https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Cheating%3A-Why-Students-Do-It-and-How-We-Can-Help-Mccabe/083a252e26bb8f483efefbe74163f6d2deb3891e](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Cheating%3A-Why-Students-Do-It-and-How-We-Can-Help-Mccabe/083a252e26bb8f483efefbe74163f6d2deb3891e)). I have used "McCabe, Donald L." in the index.  
5. The text cites Justices Holmes and Brandeis (205). These are clearly the two Supreme Court Justices. **I have indexed them "Holmes, Oliver Wendell" and "Brandeis, Louis D.", following how they are listed in VIAF.** (Note that they are cited in 205n157 as "Holmes, J." and "Brandeis, J." which may not be correct citation practice.)  
6. On 176, a list of writers are given with last names only. I have guessed at who they are and indexed them according to VIAF as follows; please let me know if this is incorrect.  
1. Aristotle: **indexed as "Aristotle"**  
2. Virgil: **indexed as "Virgil"**  
3. Shakespeare: **indexed as "Shakespeare, William"**  
4. Montaigne: **indexed as "Montaigne, Michel de"**  
5. Coleridge: **indexed as "Coleridge, Samuel Taylor"**  
6. Dryden: **indexed as "Dryden, John"**  
7. Sterne: **indexed as "Sterne, Laurence"**  
7. "Blackstone" is referenced on pages 210 (and again in n182) and 214, the latter time in proximity to "Locke". I believe these names refer to William Blackstone (author of Commentaries of the Laws of England) and John Locke (the English philosopher), and have **indexed them as "Blackstone, William" and "Locke, John".**
