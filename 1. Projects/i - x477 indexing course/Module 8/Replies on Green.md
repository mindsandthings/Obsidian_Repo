Hi, Elizabeth,  
  
My apologies for the delay in getting back to you. I was away on a business trip, and only got back last night.  
  
I've pasted your questions below, as this email system doesn't allow me to see them in the email composition window otherwise. I've inserted responses after the questions, after the ***.  
  
Best,  
Kendra  
  
Questions:  
  
1. Do you want a letter heading or extra space between alphabetic groups in the index (as opposed to no heading and no space)?  
  
*** When no specific instructions are provided regarding the alphabet separators, it's really up to you. Common practice is to at least have a space between letter groupings. Keep in mind, however, that you have a very tight line limit for this assignment. If you choose to add alphabet separators, you are using quite a few lines for that.  
  
2. I have italicized case names in the index as they are italicized in the text (*Ruckelshaus* v. *Monsanto*); please let me know if you prefer a different format.  
  
*** Unless otherwise instructed, following the text is the way to go.  
  
3. Do you want case law citations double-posted under both plaintiff and defendant? e.g., "*Brogan* v. *United States*" and "*United States*, *Brogan* v.". If so, the question comes up of whether to include a separate name entry for the plaintiff and/or defendant if named separately in the text (as is the case for LaMacchia on page 227) or if discussed in the text but only as "the plaintiff" (203) or "the submitter (214). My inclination is to double-post cases and include a page range for the discussion, but not a separate name entry just for the actual person being discussed.  
  
*** There is no right or wrong here. However, your choices will be influenced by the space constraint. If you had no space limit, then posting under both plaintiff and defendant would be an option, as would having both case and personal name entries. You may decide that these are important enough that they deserve the space, which will mean something else will need to be left out. Or you may decide that you need to limit duplication as much as possible so that you have room for additional topics. Working through the rationale for different choices is an important part of learning to work within these types of constraints.  
  
4. Do you want all names of fictional characters included in the index as well? There are seven of these: Christian, Roxane, and Cyrano de Bergerac from the play Cyrano de Bergerac (discussed in 189n85), Stewart Church (187), Cal Cunningham (187), Peter Gibson (186-187), and Gregory Keays (186-187). The material for all seven is already accessible under the names of the associated authors (and when relevant, the plagiarist's).  
  
*** Again, there is no inherently right or wrong answer. In some instances, it may be important to index fictional characters, but in others not. Think about your audience. Will law students and legal scholars have a need/desire to locate information based on the character, or is the topic they are illustrating the more salient point? As above, if there were no space limit, you could include both. Given the limit, you may very well decide to exclude entries that you deem to be less relevant to the intended audience.  
  
5. Ordinarily, I would not include passing mentions as part of hypothetical examples. For example: "What is the point of finding new words to describe Einstein's Theory of Relativity" (180-181) and "bootleg copies of a Richard Russo novel, Steven Soderbergh film, or Alison Krauss & Union Station CD" (201). Einstein, Richard Russo, Steven Soderbergh, and Alison Krauss's names are in the text here, but they used as ad hoc hypothetical examples in passing, so ordinarily I would not include them in an index. Please let me know if you would like them included anyway.  
  
*** Although the instructions tell you to include all names in the text, I would follow your instincts here. These are not truly discussions of these people. You could insert almost any name as an example without changing the underlying meaning of the text.  
  
Individual name issues:  
  
*** Regarding the various name-specific issues, I don't actually have any more information than you do, as I only have the text to work with. From the below, it seems to me that you are following good practice, i.e., following the text with regard to spelling alternatives, and noting actual errors. You can submit the list of discrepancies/first name additions when you submit the index, just as you would send this information to an editor if this were a for-hire project.  
  
1. Talmudic scholar Isaac Abarbanel (176): name authorities (VIAF and the Library of Congress) prefer the spelling Isaac Abravanel. **I have gone with Abarbanel for now, as it is in the text; please let me know if you would like Abravanel instead.**  
2. The "e" has been omitted from "Deane" for Deane Malott (more properly Deane Waldo Malott, president of Cornell University (180n47). Although he did serve at one point as an assistant dean, the note refers to events during his time as president. **I have used "Mallott, Deane Waldo" in the index.**  
3. Joe Balkoski (188): the source cites him as Joe, but he publishes under Joseph Balkoski (see his Amazon page: [https://www.amazon.com/Joseph-Balkoski/e/B001JS6IIA%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share](https://www.amazon.com/Joseph-Balkoski/e/B001JS6IIA%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share); here is an article identifying that Joseph Balkoski, author of Beyond the Beachhead, as the one who Ambrose plagiarized: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2002/01/11/stephen-ambrose-and-the-rights-of-passage/0f1ced66-d9f9-4c63-b18f-55b7dfbf1a78/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2002/01/11/stephen-ambrose-and-the-rights-of-passage/0f1ced66-d9f9-4c63-b18f-55b7dfbf1a78/)). **I have used Joseph in the index; please let me know if you would like me to do otherwise.**  
4. 191n93: the article is cited as Donald McCabe, but it was published under Donald L. McCabe (see [https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Cheating%3A-Why-Students-Do-It-and-How-We-Can-Help-Mccabe/083a252e26bb8f483efefbe74163f6d2deb3891e](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Cheating%3A-Why-Students-Do-It-and-How-We-Can-Help-Mccabe/083a252e26bb8f483efefbe74163f6d2deb3891e)). I have used "McCabe, Donald L." in the index.  
5. The text cites Justices Holmes and Brandeis (205). These are clearly the two Supreme Court Justices. **I have indexed them "Holmes, Oliver Wendell" and "Brandeis, Louis D.", following how they are listed in VIAF.** (Note that they are cited in 205n157 as "Holmes, J." and "Brandeis, J." which may not be correct citation practice.)  
6. On 176, a list of writers are given with last names only. I have guessed at who they are and indexed them according to VIAF as follows; please let me know if this is incorrect.  
7. Aristotle: **indexed as "Aristotle"**  
8. Virgil: **indexed as "Virgil"**  
9. Shakespeare: **indexed as "Shakespeare, William"**  
10. Montaigne: **indexed as "Montaigne, Michel de"**  
11. Coleridge: **indexed as "Coleridge, Samuel Taylor"**  
12. Dryden: **indexed as "Dryden, John"**  
13. Sterne: **indexed as "Sterne, Laurence"**  
14. "Blackstone" is referenced on pages 210 (and again in n182) and 214, the latter time in proximity to "Locke". I believe these names refer to William Blackstone (author of Commentaries of the Laws of England) and John Locke (the English philosopher), and have **indexed them as "Blackstone, William" and "Locke, John".**

Generally speaking, if a client asks you to index all the names, I would index all the names. However, if there are a number of instances wherein the name is used more as an identifier than as a mention of the individual person, I would clarify with the client.

2. Unfortunately, no. I don't have a sample index to send out, so in this case you can just follow Chicago.

3. You can safely assume that you should use page numbers for this. The sections for legal indexing are for when the text is broken down much more into discreet sections. Take a look at the index for CMOS and you'll see how this works.

4. As a general rule, it's safest to include a headnote any time you're doing anything other than using just page numbers. If the press doesn't want to use it, it's very easy for them to delete it. But you've provided the information, both for them and for the reader.

5. There are very few instances in which I include a title when indexing a person. I will often do this when the only other choice is to have a surname-only entry. (I also do this for disambiguation.) However, just because there is no first name included in the text doesn't mean that you have to have a surname-only entry. If the text discussed the person who gave the Gettysburg Address and only mentioned "Lincoln" you would still know who was meant, and could safely include his first name. In the case of Supreme Court Justices, there are so few of them that you could fairly easily find a name and be sure that you got the right one. Please note though -- any time I supply first names that aren't included in the text I make a list of them and forward that to the editor so that they can verify that they're all correct. The last thing you want to do is to introduce errors.

6. You don't need to forward the software file. The RTF is sufficient.

Elizabeth those are very good questions.....I wish I'd thought to ask them when I was working on that index

7) Related to #5, is it normal for a legal text to cite a Justice like J is their first name (e.g., Brandeis, J.)? If I ran into that in a non-legal text I'd assume it was a mistake.

Honestly, I don't read enough legal work to know the answer to that one.

8) From the instructions: "Author and title citations are never included in the index from the footnotes. Individuals, including authors, who are _discussed_ (as opposed to merely cited) in the footnotes and have not already been indexed from in the regular text page may be included in the index. Only _new_ conceptual information found in the footnotes is included in the index. If the same conceptual information has already been discussed in the regular text of that same page, then the page reference should be from the regular text page only and not from the footnote."  
  
This could be one combined point (individuals discussed in the footnotes can included in the footnotes if they are not already indexed in the text BUT only if the discussion ALSO contains new conceptual material). Or it could be two separate points (two types of material may be indexed from footnotes: discussions of individuals not already indexed from the text, and discussions that contain new conceptual material). For the Green index which one applies?

contain new conceptual material). For the Green index which one applies?

Okay, let's try an example. If you have a text discussing JFK, and there is a footnote attached to that discussion that discusses the coincidences between JFK and Lincoln, you would have a "Kennedy, John F." entry with a locator pointing to the page, and a "Lincoln, Abraham" entry with a locator pointing to the footnote. You would not add a locator under the Kennedy entry pointing to the footnote, because Kennedy is discussed on the page, and pointing the reader to that discussion would also point them to the footnote reference attached to that discussion.

I was thinking more of when the footnote doesn't introduce new conceptual material, but mentions a person that isn't mentioned in the text.

el

Elizabeth Bartmess

6:37 PM

Not mentions, sorry, I mean discusses.

el

Elizabeth Bartmess

6:38 PM

When a footnote has a discussion about someone, but no new conceptual info.

Taking this a bit further, if there was a discussion of Kennedy on the page, and a footnote discussing his cat (I don't actually know if he had a cat, but stay with me here), you might have "Kennedy, John F." with a locator to the discussion on the page, and then maybe another subentry "pets of" with a locator pointing to the footnote.

ke

So what you're thinking of is the "Lincoln" portion of the above example. Lincoln is only mentioned in the footnote, and it is a substantive discussion, so there's an entry for that pointing to the footnote.

el

Elizabeth Bartmess

6:42 PM

Is is the same if the footnote is an example of something discussed in the text, but with a new person introduced? So the text discusses owners of famous haunted houses, and then the footnote is like "for example, Mr. John Smith" and then gives background on John Smith, but none of it's conceptually new, it's just factual info.


ke

Kendra Millis

I think you're interpreting the "new conceptual information" part too strictly. If you have a footnote that introduces a substantive discussion of Mr. John Smith, then Mr. John Smith is the new information.

Oh, okay. That makes sense.

Thank you.
