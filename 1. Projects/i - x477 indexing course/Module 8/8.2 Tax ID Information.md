## 8.2 Tax ID Information

In the United States, every invoice sent to clients requires including either a Social Security Number or an Employee Identification Number (EIN). Because of the growing concern over identity theft, using an EIN instead of a Social Security Number is becoming an increasingly attractive option for freelancers. There are no negative tax consequences for using an EIN, and it is not necessary to have employees in order to obtain one.

Information is available on the [IRS!](http://www.irs.gov/) Publication 1635, "Understanding Your EIN," contains information on how to apply for an EIN over the telephone.

Unfortunately, some indexing clients still insist on having the Social Security Number listed on invoices in addition to the EIN. This makes identity theft a very real issue for U.S. indexers as the SSN is used by the banking industry and the credit reporting agencies. Fortunately, it is possible for U.S. indexers to freeze their credit reporting accounts, making it impossible for anyone to secure credit using your identity even if they have your Social Security Number. Freezing your credit reporting accounts is a procedure now available for residences in every state. My husband and I did this over five years ago and I highly recommend this practice to others. It is easy, safe, and brings peace of mind to anyone who may be concerned with ID theft protection.

[What can a credit freeze do for me?![]Links to an external site.](http://www.fightidentitytheft.com/credit-freeze-laws.html) includes a list of individual states allowing the credit freeze.

Since obtaining an ABN is simple and free, you would be unwise not to have one. Registering for GST (Goods and Services Tax) is a different matter altogether and will depend on your own financial situation. If you earn over $50,000, you must be registered for GST, but under $50,000 it is your choice whether you register for GST or not.

![Canada flag](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565969/preview)In Canada, you should never include your Social Insurance Number on an invoice. In fact, you should never disclose it to any client. Although you do not require a Business Number if you earn less than $30,000/year, some clients prefer using freelancers who have a BN. Business Numbers are required as soon as you start earning more than $30,000, as that is when you must start collecting and remitting the Goods and Services Tax or the Harmonized Sales Tax, depending on your province or territory. Further information is available in publication RC2(E) Rev. 09 "The Business Number and Your Canada Revenue Agency Program Accounts."
