Indexers sometimes use checklists to make sure they have considered all categories of topic. Types of terms include: actions, objects, agents, instruments, locations, time periods and viewpoints.

Types of analysis Arlene Taylor (1999) has named four approaches to analysis: 
- Purposive method: You try to identify the authorâ€™s purpose. 
- Figure-ground method: You try to determine a central figure that stands out. 
- Objective method: You count references to various items to see which are mentioned most often (computers do this well). 
- Unity, or rules of selection and rejection: You try to find out what holds the work together, and what has been said or not said. 
These approaches relate most to collection indexing, as they are methods of determining the overall purpose and content of a document. They can, however, also be applied to smaller chunks of content, such as finding a central figure in a paragraph. The unity method assumes prior knowledge of the field, so that the indexer can determine the emphasis the writer has given.
