Prominent women joint rulers in Egypt and Assyria and their husbands as stand-ins for the Great Mother goddess and her son. Gender relations. 

Queen Tiy of Egypt was joint ruler, and a temple was erected to the mother goddess Mut during her reign. After her son Akhenaton's religious revolt Mut's worship was discontinued and Tiy went into retirement. The relationship of Aton to Mut is unclear; no evidence indicate Aton was considered Mut's son (but the author thinks this is likely). 

Queen Sammu-rammat of Assyria was referred to on equal terms with her royal husband in official inscriptions, such as in a dedication to the god Nebo. The author suggests she and her husband "probably" posted as the high priest and high priestess of the ancient goddess cult (incarnations of the Great Mother and the son who displaced his sire). 

The worship of the Great Mother was the popular religion in the area, closely associated with Mediterranean agricultural rites. In Babylonia and Assyria the peoples of the goddess cult fused with the peoples of the god cult, but Ishtar absorbed many mother deities and remained prominent. 

Merodach's spouse, the goddess Zerpanitu, had as much influence as her husband. In Asia Minor the mother goddess was overshadowed by teh father god but her worship was later revived.
