Hello, everyone,

  

For our next meeting on November 28, we'll be reading chapter 4 of _Indexing Companion_. Judi pointed out that chapters 5 and 6 don't really have any exercises, while chapter 4 has quite a lot. My plan is that we'll divide up the exercises from chapter 4 over the next three meetings. For the 28th, I propose the following exercises:

  

4.2 (you may want to do 4.1 at least mentally in preparation for it), 
4.8 ==wording of topics - done==
4.11, and 
4.13 (which revisits what you did in 4.2). 


As usual, do what you have time for (sorry this is coming out later than I intended -- the week got away from me once my kid got sick).
