Four problems stand out for the frequency of their occurrence in the work of student indexers. 

1. Repeating the text, not pointing to it. (See item 7 above.) 

2. Confusing/awkward construction. In some cases, a subheading might not be incorrect, but is worded so awkwardly that it is impossible for the reader to determine exactly what is meant: 

3. Indexing what the reader doesn’t already know. This problem is a subtle one, and while it might not happen as often as the others, it should provide a caution to be avoided. Consider the following entry. ("Ten usability heuristics" - reader doesn't know there are ten)

4. Orphan locators after a heading that has subheadings. This problem is the bane of many experienced indexers and one that is especially vexing to the user. 

In addition to passes that focus on validation of cross-references, verification of locator formation, parallel double-postings, and checking for proper locator structure, one or more passes may be used to do a final check on subheading formation. 

The indexer should check subheading wording for collocation, differentiation, information scent and clarity; should review subheadings for parallel construction; and ensure that all subheadings reveal a clear relationship to the heading. 

Once you've gone through the indexing process to ascertain your metatopics and subtopics, follow these guidelines:

-   All of the main topics are listed in the index as main headings.

-   The information relating to those main headings is broken down for the convenience of the reader.

-   The double-posted entries, both main headings and subheadings, consistently list the same page references.

-   The same information is listed, and accessible to the reader, at multiple access points.

The instructions for this exercise are as follows:

-   Indexes are to be word-by-word.

-   _See also_ cross-references follow the last subheading.

-   Only use two levels of headings: main headings and subheadings. (Do not use sub-subheadings during this exercise.)

-   Use the indented format for indexes.

-   Capitalize main headings only if they are proper nouns.

-   Remember that function words are ignored in the sorting of main headings and subheadings.

-   Submit two files for _each_ index: one from the indexing program (CDX, MBK, SK7) and one .rtf file.

-   Name the files according to the file labels listed next to each nursery rhyme below.

-   You will be turning in six separate files. Be sure to name each .rtf file by indicating the software used, your name, and the course number, like so: "your name X477 CINDEX exercise2.rtf". Then attach the six files to your assignment submission.
