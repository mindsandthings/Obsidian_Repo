1.  What did you find difficult or challenging?
	1. Figuring out how and whether to index the setting. 
	2. Figuring out what to do about an unnamed speaker. 
	3. Figuring out terminology when a part is used to describe a whole. For example, the major event in Little Miss Muffet is the frightening of Little Miss Muffet, ?????
	4. Figuring out what to do when the text collapses two things into one or expands one thing into two. For example, the spider frightens Miss Muffet away, but this is actually two events: Miss Muffet experiences fright, then she leaves.  
	5. Figuring out how to handle single-item entries. 
	6. Figuring out how to handle indexing a whole vs parts of a whole. For example: ????????
2.  What part of the indexing process did you find to be easy?
	1. I was surprised how easy it was to determine relations using the who/when/what/why/where/under what circumstances questions. 
3.  Are you happy with your results? If not, what would you like to improve?
	1. I'd like to better capture the emotional arc of the queen. 
	2. 
4.  Is there anything about Exercise 2 that you'd like to comment on?
	1. It got easier conceptually when I realized that thematic relations in fiction means the relationships among characters, plot, and setting.  A main heading is one instance of any of those; a subentry is a description of the relationship of any two characters/plot events/setting elements in the context of the main heading. 


#### Further comments

realizing subentries are about the relationship between two things in the context of the main header. wondering how to handle three things. thinking about when two things are really one thing. 

#### Muffet: 
- "frightening of Little Miss Muffet" both a name used to describe the whole event, and a specific part of the event
- thinking about what matters: do the curds and whey and the tuffet matter? they're a setting, but they're not relevant to the main action. BUT these are things that modern readers will remember, because they're unusual. 
- thinking about what constitutes separate events: spider comes along, spider sits down - or is that one event? 
- thinking about completed vs uncompleted actions - eaten by vs eating by

#### Teddy bear: 
- how to index framing story
- nouning verbs. "wall sitting by" feels forced. tradeoffs between term-first and making things easy to read. 
- wondering about contents: visit to the queen is inclusive but then things happen in it
- wondering whether an unnamed speaker gets an entry 

#### Baa baa black sheep: 
- how to consider sheep's statements about master/dame/little boy as separate chapters
- wondering whether an unnamed speaker gets an entry
