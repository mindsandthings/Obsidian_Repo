### Assignments

##### **Indexing Exercise 2**

You will practice term selection of main headings and subentries from three different samples of text. After reading the text, you will identify and list topics and subtopics to be used as main headings and subentries in the index.

- [ ] #task The instructions for Exercise 2 are in [Topic 3.9](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/pages/3-dot-9-indexing-exercise-2 "3.9 Indexing Exercise 2"). Do not attempt to complete this exercise until you have done all of the assigned reading.

##### **Online Research**

The publishing industry is constantly evolving new standards, technologies, and even business practices. As such, it is important for indexers to keep up with new developments. Because freelance indexers tend to work in isolation, it isn't always easy for them to keep abreast of changes that could affect their livelihood. Taking workshops, reading indexing reference books, and individual study are ways to keep abreast of these changes. There is no online research assignment in this module.
