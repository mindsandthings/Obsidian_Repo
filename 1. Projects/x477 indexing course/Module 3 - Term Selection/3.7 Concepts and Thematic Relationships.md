## 3.7 Concepts and Thematic Relationships

_Adapted from "Application of Cognitive Skills to Term Selection" (_The Indexer_, April 2002) by Sylvia Coates, 2003_

Identifying the metatopics, subtopics, and meaning of the text is only the first half of the term selection process. The second half is identifying the thematic relationships between all of these topics and recreating them in the index structure as main headings and subheadings (and sub-subheadings when appropriate).

Indexers often speak of the "art" of indexing and the difficulty involved in both teaching and learning how to index. Mulvany uses the analogy of teaching someone to paint but not being able to make them an artist. In addition to good writing and reading comprehension skills, competent indexing apparently requires certain innate indexing abilities, just as an artist has innate artistic abilities. My experience with teaching hundreds of students has led me to believe that the innate ability to conceptualize thematic relationships is crucial to becoming a good indexer. To explore this theory, let us first define the terms "conceptualize" and "thematic relationships."

When we **conceptualize**, we form concepts. Concepts, as defined by _Webster's New World Dictionary_, are general notions or ideas. According to a study by Lin and Murphy (2001)\*, concepts may be organized by _similarities_ -- a kind of classification they describe as "forming a kind." Animal species and genus classifications are examples of this type of organization. Or, Lin and Murphy found, concepts may be organized by _external relations within scenes or events_. This second type of organization uses **thematic relationships**.

As an example of the differences between classification and thematic relations, let us use the word "cake." In terms of classification, "cake" could be conceptualized as a _dessert_, along with pies, cupcakes, puddings, and so forth. However, in terms of thematic relations, "cake" could be conceptualized as part of a _birthday_ scheme, including presents, party, candles, and birthday.

Here's an illustration of the different approaches, using a different example:

The Thematic Relationship approach, on the right half of the graphic, relates three safari items, binoculars, a camera, and a Jeep, to the giraffe.](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565823/preview)

Lin and Murphy determined that while children readily think in terms of thematic relations, most adults think in terms of classification schemes. But they found that when adults use thematic relations, there is significant impact on the abilities to construct meaning and perform inductive reasoning. The authors' conclusions are that the use of thematic relations by adults strongly influences their conceptual representations.
