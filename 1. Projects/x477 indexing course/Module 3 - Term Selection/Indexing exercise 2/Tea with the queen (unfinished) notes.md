File label: Teatime

(This one is longer than the others and may be more of a challenge, but it will be good practice -- remember to have some fun with it!)

Teddy bear, teddy bear, 1  
Where have you been? 2  
I've been up to London to visit the queen! 3

I went to her palace, 4  
And knocked at the gate, 5  
And one of her soldiers said, please would I wait? 6

Then one of her footmen, 7  
All dressed in red, 8  
Led me inside, saying, step this way Ted! 9

And there in a huge room, 10  
High on her throne, 11  
Sat the poor queen, taking tea all alone, 12

She said, how delightful, 13  
Sit down, fill your tum! 14  
And soon we were chattering just like old chums! 15

And when time came to leave, 16  
She shook hands and then, 17  
She said, come back soon, we must do it again! 18
