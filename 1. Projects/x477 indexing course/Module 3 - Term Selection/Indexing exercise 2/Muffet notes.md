lingering issues:
-- curds and whey: only have one entry. omit? add an entry? [edit: after talking to Kendra, include it because readers will be interested in it]
-- tuffet: didn't inclde as its own entry becvause wall was excluded in dumpty example, but not sure if their exclusion was intentional [edit: after talking to Kendra, include it because readers will be interested in it]
-- frightening of Little Miss Muffet: can't do see spider, it's not a preferred term issue
-- frightening and departure 
-- no see also 


-- tuffet is the whole scene not just 1-2
-- "frightening of Little Miss Muffet" both a name used to describe the whole event, and a specific part of the event
