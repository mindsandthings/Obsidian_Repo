## 8.4 Enhancing the Indexing Process: CINDEX

You've already read how differently individual indexers can approach the indexing tasks. In this and the next two lecture topics, we have three different indexers explain how their software programs facilitate, enhance, and impact their indexing process. How indexers use their software makes their indexing process either more or less efficient.

Remember, your business goal is to learn to index as efficiently as possible as well as to write a well-done index. How you use your software will determine how efficiently you are able to index. And, your indexing efficiency will ultimately determine your indexing income. As you read these descriptions try to compare how efficient their indexing approaches are and which ones may best suit your own evolving style of indexing.

### Lucie Haskins: How I Use CINDEX in My Indexing Process

![notepad](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565849/preview)Lucie Haskins became an indexer in 2000 after a long career in corporate America, with roles spanning the computer industry to management consulting. She specializes in embedded indexing and in computer- and business-related topics. She loves to share her passion for indexing by talking about it to whomever will listen! She has given workshops on embedded indexing to ASI chapters, at ASI national conferences, and to local university-level technical writing classes. She has served on the ASI Board, is a member of the ASI Webmasters team, and is past president of the Rocky Mountain chapter. She has a BS degree in Technical Management and an MBA.

_Steps I take and decisions I make during my indexing process:_

One of the best tools you can have in your indexing arsenal is your indexing software. Indexing software takes care of the organizational aspects of indexing (formatting to the client's specifications), and provides you with powerful editing tools (temporary grouping, cascading changes, autocomplete, hotkeys, macros) that help you easily shape your index into its final form.

Most indexers try different techniques and adapt their indexing style over time. I've outlined my current work style below and illustrated just how critical CINDEX is in all aspects of my indexing process.

#### 1\. Create CINDEX Files Based on Client Specifications

When I receive formatting specifications from clients, I input them into CINDEX and then save both template and stylesheet files for that client. I can then apply the saved template and stylesheet files (that contain the format settings) to new client projects.

#### 2\. Familiarize Myself with the Text and Entering Placeholder Terms into CINDEX.

I don't mark up the text. Instead, I start indexing directly from the unmarked pages so it's crucial for me to familiarize myself with the material as much as possible before I start.

To that end, I try to obtain the Front Matter and Back Matter for my books. (Ask your clients for these additional materials -- in case they aren't in the habit of sending them -- because they help so much in understanding the overall structure of the book.)

I read the Table of Contents and the Introduction/Preface to understand the high-level structure of the book and the Glossary to get a sense of the terms the author considers important. As I start reviewing these terms and concepts, I enter them as placeholder index entries into CINDEX, with an entry of term?? in the locator field. (Remember, these are placeholders so they don't correlate to any specific pages.) I also label the placeholder entries in red so they "pop out" visually in my preview window.

Completing this step helps me create the super high-level skeleton framework for the index and provides me with a roadmap as I delve deeper into the book.

#### 3\. Enter Index Terms One Chapter at a Time

Since indexing involves both a macro (high-level) and micro (detailed) approach, I use a two-phased approach when entering index terms.

##### **Macro Level First**

For each chapter, I start with the high-level (macro) view. What are the main concepts for this chapter? How do these concepts relate to the high-level concepts for the entire book? What index terms should represent these concepts? How do these index terms relate to other terms in the index? And then I start creating the index entries that represent the answers to those questions.

During this stage (which goes quite quickly), I only peruse the chapter's section headings and ignore the detailed text.

As I input index terms, my CINDEX preferences are set so the preview of the index entry jumps to the section of the index that will accommodate the new term. I can see at a glance what the surrounding entries are. I can make snap decisions about wordsmithing the new entries. In addition, with autocomplete turned on, I only have to type till autocomplete matches the phrasing I desire. If there isn't a match, I just input the entire phrase. These two mechanisms help me keep my index structure tight. As another time-saving device, I can customize hotkeys to insert whatever text I desire. (I have two of my hotkeys set to insert curly quotes.)

If I'm unsure about a specific entry, I append short questions (to myself) to the index record.

I use CINDEX's abbreviations function, which consists of a table of short abbreviations and their equivalent expanded form. I create short (usually 2-character) sequences that I'm not likely to use in my normal course of indexing. When I need to flag an entry for later decision-making, I enter that predefined abbreviation and it automatically expands into the specific query I have for that term. Here are a few abbreviations I use as needed:

au ... (author??)  
dp ... (doublepost??)  
ne ... (needed??)  
piu ... (pick it up??)  
sc ... (scattered??)  
so ... (sort order??)  
wo ... (wordsmith??)

I always use double question marks (??) as my reminder that I have questions about a specific index entry. (All entries with ?? that haven't been resolved during the course of indexing get addressed during final editing.)

I also consider if flipping main and subentries would provide an appropriate entry. If so, CINDEX's flip feature easily creates the "flipped" entry in one step where main and subentries are demoted/promoted appropriately.

##### **Micro Level Next**

After I've finished entering the higher level terms for the chapter, I then go back to the beginning of the chapter and read the text itself.

By this point, I'm confident that I've already captured the major themes of the chapter, so I just concentrate on the individual details.

Of course, I might find a connection between other topics in other sections of the material and, as I do, I enter the appropriate terms -- using the mechanisms I've described above to help me manipulate the entries quickly and surely.

I continue reading through the chapter (keeping my placeholder terms in mind in case I come across the concepts they represent) and create index entries as warranted. This is the substance/meat/flesh on the skeleton . . . the richness of the index . . . the golden nuggets.

#### 4\. Repeat Step 3 for Each Additional Chapter

#### 5\. Edit as I Go, and Final Editing

I edit as I go. Whenever I happen to come across something that needs to be edited, such as slightly different spellings or descriptive text for entries, or plural versus singular forms, or typos, or discovering that an index entry now needs subentries because there are now too many undifferentiated locators or . . . . The list is infinite of what's possible to find.

Whenever I encounter a record that needs a final decision, I stop what I'm doing and I deal with it on the spot. This helps in many ways (it saves huge amounts of time at the end of the project when I'm tired of the material and just want to get the job done) but it also helps in that I'm addressing the problem when my mind is focused on that term.

CINDEX also allows me to create temporary groups on the fly. Using the very powerful Find feature, I can search for words/phrases in an almost endless variety of ways: by pattern, main entry, subentry, page locator, formatting, combinations of words/phrases, etc. etc.

So my editing consists of (1) editing as I input and then (2) a final short editing step at the very end.

My final editing includes the following items:

-   Quick eyeball of the index from A-Z to verify the entries look solid and nothing looks out of place
-   Resolve remaining ??
-   Spell check (CINDEX feature)
-   Check my cross-references (CINDEX feature)
-   Check for orphan subheadings (CINDEX feature)
-   Check for out-of-range page numbers by putting the index in page order and checking the first and last page numbers
-   Run IndexChk program (third-party utility for CINDEX)
-   Verify the client's formatting instructions have been followed (CINDEX template and style sheets)

And that's my process. Hopefully it's given you food for thought on what you might incorporate into your indexing regimen.

Remember, your indexing process should always represent the best methods you've discovered to increase your efficiency and to create the best possible indexes you can create. And that includes learning your indexing software inside out.
