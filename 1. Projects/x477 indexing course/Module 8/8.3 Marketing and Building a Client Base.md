## 8.3 Marketing and Building a Client Base

Marketing is something that can terrorize and paralyze even experienced indexers. Very few indexers actually enjoy this necessary part of the business. The important thing is to find the marketing approach that is most comfortable for you. If you aren't able to make marketing somehow palatable, you will never be able to build enough of a client base to maintain a freelance business.

Direct marketing, contacting potential clients with a marketing package or phone call, may simply be too difficult for some new indexers. Fortunately, there are indirect methods by which a newbie can obtain indexing experience. We've already discussed networking with other indexers. Experienced indexers often have to turn down work, so they may refer jobs to you, especially if they know your skill level. Or they may subcontract the work out to you. Here are a few other ways to quietly market yourself:

-   Volunteer your indexing services to nonprofit organizations. You may not be paid for these projects, but you will be building a resume of indexing experience.
-   Volunteer in local chapters of indexing organizations. Working with other indexers may be the most effective way to network.
-   Focus on a special skill or professional background you may have. I know of one indexer who was able to parlay her fifteen years working for a well-known environmental group into her first indexing projects on environmental books. An editor may actually be more interested in your special knowledge skills than in your indexing training and experience.

Should you elect to market directly to a potential client, you'll have to contact the individual who coordinates the client's freelancer list. This individual is usually a production editor. If the information is not listed on the publisher's Web site, you can telephone the publisher and ask for the name of the person to whom you should send your marketing information. Make sure that it is the individual who coordinates the freelance list, and always address your marketing package to a specific person and not to the department-at-large or human resources.

Two excellent resources for information on U.S. publishers are the annually published _Writer's Market_ and _Literary Market Place_. _Literary Market Place_, which is the directory of the American book publishing industry, is quite expensive but is fortunately available at most local libraries. You can also purchase a one-week subscription at a reasonable cost of $24.95.

![Australia flag](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565761/preview)For information on Australian publishers the best source of information is the _Australian Publishers Association Directory of Members_ published annually. A more readily accessible alternative is to look at the monthly _Australian Bookseller and Publisher_ which provides news about the most active major Australian publishers. Both publications are available through most public libraries.

![Canada flag](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565969/preview)Canadian publishers, along with other information such as their types of publications, key contacts, etc., are listed in _The Book Trade in Canada_, which is published annually. A briefer listing is available in the semi-annual _Canadian Publishers Digest_. Both are available in most libraries.

![notepad](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565849/preview)When I was a new indexer, a more-experienced indexer advised me that it takes at least eight clients to sustain a full-time freelance business. We define "clients" here as publisher clients who may have several editors all contacting you for repeat indexing projects. Over the years, I have found that advice to be very accurate.

Fears about marketing are perfectly normal. Every successful indexer has experienced the same fears and self-doubt. We all have our own stories on how we tackled the marketing beast and were able to land those first clients.

Here is an established indexer (and one of our instructors) reporting on her own first-hand experience as a new indexer who successfully faced down the terrors of marketing.

She left a career in international education and chose to become a freelancer so she could return to her home state of Maine to raise her daughter. Kendra has served as a Director at large on ASI’s Board of Directors and served as ASI President in 2017–2018. Her educational background is in Russian literature and social philosophy. In addition to her indexing work, Kendra owns a small fiber-related business.
