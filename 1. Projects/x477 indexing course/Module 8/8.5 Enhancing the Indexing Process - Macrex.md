## 8.5 Enhancing the Indexing Process: MACREX

### Sheila M. Ryan: Writing an Index in MACREX

![notepad](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565849/preview)Sheila M. Ryan completed the UC Berkeley Indexing course in August 2006 and has been indexing professionally since January 2007. With degrees in oceanography and environmental management, she specializes in indexing science texts but also writes indexes for trade and scholarly publications in numerous subject areas. Born and raised in Wisconsin, Sheila currently lives in Portland, Oregon, where she enjoys sweep rowing on the Willamette River.

_A general description of my indexing process using Macrex Version 8:_

#### Text Orientation and File Setup

-   Work on screen from pdf files (I do not print out or mark up the page proofs).
-   Use an Excel file to track time spent on orientation, writing, and editing phases.
-   Confirm and note the number of indexable pages.
-   Read Table of Contents; scroll through file to get a general sense of text density.
-   Read a few paragraphs to get a feel for the author's writing style.
-   Create a project folder for the index in my Indexes\\Clients folder on my C:drive. Confirm with repeat clients whether style specifications have changed.
-   Check that I have the correct client-specific word processor and layout files (the Macrex .mwp and .lay "definition" files) that are used for generating an .rtf file of the index. Contact Gale Rhoades (U.S. tech support and sales rep. for Macrex in the U.S.) for assistance with any custom layouts that client requests.

#### Writing the Index

**Scanning, reading, and analyzing text**. I skip over any introductory chapters and come back to these near the end of writing the index. It's not always clear from a summary or introductory chapter what will be a recurring theme vs. what may only be touched on in passing as part of an overview to the text. I tend to make a single pass through the text, scanning and analyzing as I continue to ask myself for each paragraph, section, or span: "What is this about?" and "What is this related to?"

**Working on screen**. I find that I can index much more quickly when I work with all files on screen and do not have to wrangle a binder or copy stand, flipping pages back and forth. I use Alt-Tab on my keyboard to toggle between Macrex and the pdf file on screen while writing index entries. I use Page Up and Page Down, as well as Alt-Up Arrow and Alt-Down Arrow to quickly move through the pdf file. In the Macrex file, I can press F1 to shift from "Add Entry" mode to "Inspect" mode, type in the first few letters of an entry, and press Enter to quickly move to any location in the index file (this really speeds up my movement through long index files!).

**Backups**. Macrex has an auto-save feature, and I also use a keyboard macro to quickly make multiple backups (.mbk files) during an indexing session. At the end of a day's indexing session, I email the most recent .mbk file to myself and I also save the .mbk onto a flash drive for additional backup. Cumulative Backups can be turned on or off; I keep Cumulative Backups turned on, so that no backup files are overwritten and I do not lose any part of my work.

**Notes and Tags**. I write notes to myself in the index using hidden text. Adding a fair number of notes, especially when beginning an index, helps me get a good feel for the text as the index structure forms. It also helps me to maintain momentum and continue to move quickly through the text. If I need to verify something or add something to another entry that is related to the entry I am currently writing, I can quickly add task-specific tags while remaining focused on the current paragraph, page, or page span.

**Macros**. I record keyboard macros for any process that requires multiple repeated keystrokes. I can assign dozens of macros to my own preferred key combinations. Macrex also comes loaded with many system-defined macros, such as italicizing text (press Ctrl-Shift-I). Macros I use all the time include inserting hidden text, adding tags to notes, and creating backup files; my custom macros are saved to a .macros file and reloaded for the next project.

**Diacritics**. Accents, diacritics, and symbols are all coded directly into the Macrex index entries as I type them (usually with Unicode font set coding but other fonts can be loaded). Send a test file to the editor or compositor to make sure there are no compatibility issues on the client's end.

**Search and Replace**. Macrex allows me to enter customized search strings to find specific entries or groups of entries, which can save tons of time when editing indexes. For example, I can find all index entries that are annotated with "fig" (indicating a figure) and replace these annotated entries with bold locators. I do not have to scroll through the file changing each entry, and changes are complete and consistent throughout the index.Check that I have the correct client-specific word processor and layout files (the Macrex .mwp and .lay "definition" files) that are used for generating an .rtf file of the index. Contact Gale Rhoades (U.S. tech support and sales rep. for Macrex in the U.S.) for assistance with any custom layouts that client requests.

**Time-Savers**. Wherever I can eliminate keystrokes, I am indexing faster, preventing possible errors, and making more money per hour!

-   The "Yank" function allows me to quickly select and copy all or part of an index entry and then paste it elsewhere within the index.
-   "Flip" allows me to quickly create main headings from subentries.
-   The "Group" function allows me to quickly perform many tasks, including:

-   Check and confirm how I am wording certain phrases or concepts
-   Confirm that double-posted entries are consistent
-   Quickly find and return to a specific entry within the index

-   Table of Authorities/Autocomplete: The Table of Authorities (TOA) feature can be used to import previous versions of indexes, so that phrasing remains consistent and entries do not have to be re-keyed. In the following screen shot, I typed "ch" and scrolled down the TOA list (grey box) that popped up on my screen to highlight and select "Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest."

**Length**. With a specific length limit for an index, use the Macrex "Quick .rtf" feature to open the index in Word. Adjust the margins in Word to set the maximum allowable number of characters per line. Determine the total number of lines to get an approximate idea of final index length. If running long, reduce the depth of indexing for the remaining pages and edit the existing index entries accordingly. Remember to use a monospace font if you need to check the maximum number of characters per line.

**Format**. Contact Gale Rhoades at Macrex for client-specific custom layouts. Often it is just a matter of making a few modifications to existing word processor and layout files that already exist in Macrex. If I modify layout files I always add a few phrases to the file description that explain the changes. For example, adding "En-dash, No HL, run-on" to the file description means I have changed the concatenator from a hyphen to an En-dash, I have removed header letters, and I have modified the settings to produce run-on subheadings.

#### Editing the Index

I do a lot of editing as I write the index, making decisions as I am writing about how I want to phrase and structure entries. I examine the wording of main headings, and consider whether subheadings are phrased in a manner that reads smoothly. Are the meanings of entries clear and will they make sense to all potential readers? Are keywords as close to the beginning of subentries as possible? I add cross-references as I write the index. I also spend some time making checks and edits after I have written index entries for all of the pages. Some of the things I check include:

-   For entries with only one or just a few subheadings, collapse the entry (i.e., just have page locators with no descriptive subheadings).
-   Can I combine any subentries? I use the Block Delete feature of Macrex to speed up this process.
-   Does anything look over- or underindexed?
-   Do I need to add, modify, or delete any cross-references?
-   Are all double-posted entries consistent?
-   Create a project folder for the index in my Indexes\\Clients folder on my C:drive. Confirm with repeat clients whether style specifications have changed.
-   Check through all remaining notes to myself and resolve any remaining issues.

#### Step By Step: Loading Definition Files and Creating an .RTF File in Macrex

The steps listed here are only necessary when the final index format is other than that which results from Quick RTF (i.e., pressing F at the Main Menu). With the index file open and looking at the Macrex main menu page, select Output and highlight "Main Output/Print Subprogram" (or, just press O when at the main menu page).

-   To change the word processing format (e.g., from hanging indents to tabbed indents or to change the font), at the Output Menu, press the letter O to get to the "Add or edit Optional printing features" screen.
-   To load a different word processing format, press "Ctrl-L," W, and Y. Press F5, scroll down to highlight the desired .mwp file, and press Enter twice to select and load the file. Press Enter again, which returns you to the Output Subprogram page.
-   To change the font, press R. Press F5, scroll down to highlight the desired font, and press Enter twice to select and load the file. Press Enter again, which returns you to the Output Subprogram page.
-   To change the layout (e.g., from indented to run-on subheadings) press L at the Output Menu to see a list of layout (.lay) files. Press F5, scroll down, highlight, press Enter to select, and press Enter again to load the layout file. Now you are back at the Macrex Output Subprogram page.
-   To make the word processor file, press W, press Enter to save the file to the default selection (C:drive), modify the file name if necessary, modify or delete the index heading, and press Enter. The .rtf file should be open on screen at this point.

#### Finalizing the Index

-   Open the index in Word, run Spellcheck, and scan file for any phrasing issues.
-   Add a brief header with page numbers, the book title, and a note that it is a draft index.
-   Save a copy of the file.
-   Make final edits and changes to the index file in Macrex.
-   In Macrex, put the file in Page-Number-Order (PNO); check cross-references and confirm that highest page number is correct.
-   Use the Read feature to load the most current .mbk file and run through the error checks that are programmed into Macrex.
-   Generate and save a final.rtf file, summarize any queries for the editor or author, and transmit these with the index file via email.
-   Quick RTF: Many of my clients do not have highly specific or complex style requirements, and it is often sufficient for me to use the default files that Macrex uses for its single keystroke "Quick RTF" feature, which saves me a lot of time at the end of each indexing project.

#### Overall Thoughts on Macrex

The key things about Macrex that appeal to me are its speed and flexibility: there are often many different ways to do the same task. It has taken time and effort to learn how to use certain features of Macrex and to figure out what approach works best for me, but I know my indexing has become much faster and I am working much more efficiently over time.

While you are still learning about the indexing process and profession, take the time to figure out which software works best for you. I am confident in taking on projects of any length or complexity, because I know that even if I haven't used a specific tool or procedure yet, Macrex has the capability of producing the index file to fit exact client specifications. I can focus on analyzing text and crafting my index entries, without having to worry about whether the final formatted output will be correct.
