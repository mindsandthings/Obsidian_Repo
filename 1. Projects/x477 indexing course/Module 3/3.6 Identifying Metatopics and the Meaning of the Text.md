## 3.6 Identifying Metatopics and the Meaning of the Text

Now that you have been introduced to the process of identifying main headings and subheadings (or metatopics and subtopics of the text), you will get an opportunity to practice.

We'll be using familiar nursery rhymes to practice identifying metatopics and meaning.

**Mary Had a Little Lamb**

Mary had a little lamb  
Its fleece as white as snow.  
And everywhere that Mary went  
The lamb was sure to go.  
It followed her to school one day  
Which was against the rules.  
It made the children laugh and play  
To see a lamb in school.

We will assume, as with the "Humpty Dumpty" nursery rhyme, that each line is a chapter with a page reference that represents the chapter page range. So the first line is page 1, the second page 2, and so forth.

"Mary had a little lamb  
Its fleece as white as snow."

lamb  
   Mary's ownership of, 1  
   characteristics of, 2  
Mary  
   white lamb owned by, 1-2

Notice that in order to discern the meaning of this text, it is sometimes necessary to use two lines and not just one line. The same is true in a book. The metatopic (here there are two: "Mary" and "lamb") may be ascertained within a single sentence, a paragraph, or a larger section of the text.

In the two entries above, the page references are not alike, because they have slightly different information. The subheading following "Mary" refers to the second line as well as the first line of the rhyme. The first subheading following "lamb" refers only to the first line of the rhyme, while the second subheading following "lamb" refers to the second line of the rhyme.

"And everywhere that Mary went  
The lamb was sure to go."

lamb  
   Mary followed everywhere by, 3-4  
Mary  
   followed everywhere by lamb, 3-4

Notice the double-posting of page references when the subheadings contain the same information. It is important to maintain consistent double-posting throughout the index.

"It followed her to school one day  
which was against the rules."

lamb  
   follows Mary to school, 5  
   school rules against presence by, 6  
Mary  
   lamb follows Mary to school, 5  
school  
   lamb follows Mary to, 5  
   rules against pets at, 6  
children  
   school rules regarding pets of, 6

Notice that the double-posting is consistent in all of the subheadings containing the same information. And, we have picked up two new metatopics: school and children. It is also important to capture the more subtle aspects of the text. In this case, that is the children’s behavior in class.

"It made the children laugh and play  
To see a lamb in school."

children  
   response to lamb by, 7-8  
classroom behavior  
   disruption due to lamb, 7-8  
   expectations of, 6  
lamb  
   response of children to, 7-8

The index structure continues to maintain the consistent double-posting in each of the subheadings containing the same information. In addition, we can insert a _See also_ cross-reference between the classroom behavior and school main headings. Notice that these two main headings include related but slightly different information. If a reader looks up classroom behavior they may also be interested in the related information to be found under schools. By providing a _See also_ cross-reference the index provides the reader with access to this related but different information.

### Putting the Entries All Together

Once you've gone through the indexing process to ascertain your metatopics and subtopics, follow these guidelines:

-   All of the main topics are listed in the index as main headings.

-   The information relating to those main headings is broken down for the convenience of the reader.

-   The double-posted entries, both main headings and subheadings, consistently list the same page references.

-   The same information is listed, and accessible to the reader, at multiple access points.

children  
   response to lamb by, 7-8  
   school rules regarding pets of, 6

classroom behavior  
   disruption due to lamb, 7-8  
   expectations of, 6  
   _See also_ school

lamb  
   characteristics of, 2  
   follows Mary to school, 5  
   Mary followed everywhere by, 3-4  
   Mary's ownership of, 1  
   response of children to, 7-8  
   school rules against presence by, 6

Mary  
   followed everywhere by lamb, 3-4  
   lamb follows her to school, 5  
   white lamb owned by, 1-2

school  
   lamb follows Mary to, 5  
   rules against pets at, 6  
   _See also_ classroom behavior
