49-­‐51 Chapter 3: “How Indexers Work” (you may stop at “What Not to   Index”)  


# Chicago: Sections 16.9-16.10; 16.29-16.31; 16:126-16.130 (this will be a review of some of the Module 2 reading)

## Main headings 16.9-10
* Main headings: Noun or noun phrase; almost never an adjective alone (pair with an noun instead)
* Index subentries: break up if >5-6 locators; often form a  grammatical relationship with the main heading; at other times forms divisions or units
## General principles 16.29-31
- Style and usage in the index relative to the work: same spellings, italicizations, quotation marks. If inclusive numbers are given in full in the text, give them in full in the index. 
- Choosing indexing terms: choose according to the author's usage if at all possible. If author uses multiple, use cross-references. 
- Don't index stuff that has just nothing to do with the theme of the work, for example: “After World War II small sports cars  like the British MG, often owned by returning veterans, began to make  their appearance in college towns like Northampton, Massachusetts, and  Ann Arbor, Michigan" (don't index the place names)
- Similarly, names or terms that occur in passing references and scene- setting elements that are not essential to the theme of a work need not be indexed. (An exception might be  made if certain readers of a publication would be likely to look for their  own names in the index. Occasional vanity entries are not forbidden.) 

## Editing and refining the entries 16:126-16.130
- Choose among synonymous or closely related terms, preparing xrefs if necessary
- Decide whether some entries are better as main entries or as subentries
- Break up if >5-6 locators
- Phrase subheadings as concisely as possible and begin with a keyword
- Check cross-references against edited index headings
