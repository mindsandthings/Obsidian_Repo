## 5.4 Concurrent Process of Selecting and Editing Terms

In order accomplish this last component in The Berkeley Way of Indexing, it is necessary to briefly review different common approaches to term selection and editing of an index to exemplify the differences between more versus less efficient indexing processes.

**Example 1:** The traditional approach to indexing is to divide up the indexing process into two halves. The first half is to select terms and, when that process has been completed, to then edit the index. Indexers using this approach report that they can easily spend 40% of the project time on editing. And this type of editing includes major adjustments to the index structure including the rewriting and moving around of entries in addition to proofing and spell-checking. Though it is certainly possible to write a high-quality index this way, this is not a particularly time-efficient approach.

**Example 2:** Instead of using the above traditional approach to indexing, there are many indexers who describe their indexing process as being one in which they continually edit the index as they select terms. Here is an illustration of what that process may look like:

Unfortunately, even though this process may seem to be more efficient than the traditional method of selecting terms and then editing, in reality it takes about the same amount of time. And again, while it is certainly possible to end up with a high-quality index using this term selection and editing process, it isn't likely to significantly improve indexing time and efficiency. There is just as much time spent editing the entries and restructuring the index as when using the traditional indexing method -- the process has simply been rearranged.

So what kind of process is more efficient and time-saving while still allowing for a high-quality index to be written? My suggestion, and the method that I have used very successfully, is the term selection and concurrent editing process illustrated here:

**Example 3:** The key to the concurrent term selection and editing process is the OHIO (Only Handle It Once) principle. This principle dictates that you write each entry only once and the goal is to never have to rewrite or edit that entry ever again. The easiest way to envision using the OHIO principle with the concurrent methodology is by using a cookbook indexing project as an example. Though a cookbook index structure is particularly suited to showing how this process works, it is important to note that this process can be applied to virtually any type of text, from a simple trade book to the most complex of scholarly text.

Imagine that you are indexing a dessert recipe book and turn to the page describing a Chocolate Roll Cake (bush de Noel). Here is the recipe and, below it, observe how entries are selected and placed into the existing index. The new entries will be in red font for easy visualization:

**Chocolate Roll Cake (_bûche_  _de Noël)_:**

Butter baking sheet and line with parchment paper  
Separate 4 eggs  
Beat egg yolks with ½ c. sugar and ¼ tsp. vanilla until eggs are thick  
Combine 3 Tbsp cocoa and ¾ c. shifted flour. Stir into egg yolk mixture. Beat egg whites until stiff and fold into batter. Fold in 2 Tbsp. melted butter.  
Spread the batter on the prepared baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes. Turn out on clean towel, remove paper from bottom and roll lengthwise into towel. Cool for about 20 minutes.

Filling:

Bring 2/3 c. cream and 2 Tbsp. butter to rapid boil.  Add: 10 oz. dark sweet chocolate, cut into pieces, and stir until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Cool. Beat vigorously.

Topping:

Whip: 1 cup cream and stir in: 3 oz. dark sweet chocolate, melted and slightly cooled.

Presentation:

Unroll cake, spread with filling and roll again. Place on long serving boards. Swirl topping over top and sides of roll. Sprinkle with shaved chocolate

Here are selected portions of the index for the purpose of the demonstration:

As you look over the above index (remember -- it is only a partial index), you can see where the Chocolate Roll Cake (in bold font) has been inserted as a main heading as well as a subheading under the Chocolate and Cake main headings. All three of these entry points are made during the same time so that the indexer does not have to ever go back to either add or edit the Chocolate Roll Cake later on. The Chocolate Roll Cake entries are exhaustive -- that is, "all" the entries for the Chocolate Roll Cake topic have been inserted into the index structure and there will be no more significant time spent indexing this particular topic. The only additional time will be during the final editing, looking for typos or any other loose ends instead of needing to either add or move around the Chocolate Roll Cake. This is the essence of OHIO (Only Handle It Once) as you select and add the term to all access points in the index during the same single sweep.

It should be obvious how much time is saved in the indexing process when the term is added at all access points in the index structure _at the same time_ without the need to go back and spend time on that term other than a final check.

Though the above example is for a simple cookbook, this same process can be applied to virtually every text and to every indexing project imaginable. Obviously it is more difficult to apply to a more complex topic but, in principle, this method will work for every indexing project you may come across.

Returning to our Humpty Dumpty example -- allow me to demonstrate how several topics can be inserted at multiple access points in the index.  To demonstrate the concurrent term selection and editing while following the OHIO principle the four topics of the text will be numbered to more easily track how each topic fits into the index structure.

Things to note:

-   There are 4 topics in this text. All of them are listed in the index structure, but they may have a different number of access points. And you'll notice that the same topic may have been slightly reworded in order to fit with specific main headings but that the topic information and page references will remain the same.  
    
-   Some topics are only main headings, other topics are only subheadings, while some topics are both main heading and subheadings. One of the most important tasks is to differentiate which are which in the index structure.
    
-   The entries are numbered according to topic in order to more easily track the multiple access points of each individual topic.
    

The topics are:

(1) Humpty Dumpty sitting on the wall  
(2) Humpty Dumpty's fall  
(3) Arrival by King's horses and men to help  
(4) Failure by King's horses and men to fix Humpty Dumpty

The remaining entries are numbered according to the topic they represent. The three main protagonists of the story, Humpty Dumpty; King's horses; and King's men, are all in bold font as their roles overlap more than one topic. So, just for the purpose of this example, they are in bold font in the index.

(2) the fall  
   (3) Kings' horses/men arrive following, 7-9  
   (4) permanent nature of damage from, 10-13  
   (2) suffered by Humpty Dumpty, 4-6  
**Humpty Dumpty**  
   (2) fall by, 4-6  
   (4) permanent damage suffered by, 10-13  
   (1) wall sitting by, 1-3  
**King's horses**  
   (3) arrival after the fall by Humpty Dumpty, 7-9  
   (4) failure to repair Humpty Dumpty by, 10-13  
**King's men**  
   (3) arrival after the fall by Humpty Dumpty, 7-9  
   (4) failure to repair Humpty Dumpty by, 10-13  
(1) the wall  
   (1) Humpty Dumpty sitting on, 1-3  
   (2) Humpty Dumpty's fall from, 4-6

Just as in the Chocolate Roll Cake example, as you select and insert each topic as an index entry, you'll OHIO and then move on to the next topic. By the time you have completed inserting each individual topic found in the text, you'll have a detailed and complete index structure.

Now, it is important to realize that this is an ideal process and a goal to be sought after by the indexer seeking to increase their indexing efficiency. During the actual application of this process, there will inevitably be times when you may change your mind about something and rearrange entries. But the objective is to write as many, if not all, entries in their final form (which includes wording and access point in the index structure) as possible the first time around. Working in this way will result in having very little to edit by the time all of the term selection has been completed. The desired outcome of this process is that the final editing will consist of only spell-checking, looking for orphan subheadings, and any other loose ends to be found in the index.

Several points to remember:

-   As you begin to read the text, ask the information questions and think about the thematic concepts in the text. The answers to the information question as well as the thematic concepts will become the index main headings and subheadings.
    
-   Follow the OHIO principle and insert the topic in _all of the appropriate access points in the index all at once._ Try not to go back and rewrite the entry later, or to add the entry later to another access point in the index, or to later review the entry except during the very last editing sweep. Now, understand that while the goal is to not go back and rewrite or add entries it doesn't mean that you can "never" go back and edit your entries, only that you should try to write your entries in such a way that is isn't necessary.
    
-   You should find that the time spent editing the index is significantly less than usual. The editing time should continue to decline as you get more practiced using this method.
    
-   Remember that this is a new indexing process for you so there will be a learning curve. That means that you should not be overly frustrated if this doesn't work perfectly for you the first time around. This is a method that will become a habit with enough practice. So give yourself a break as the process will become more automatic the more you use it.
    
-   My experience has been that the index structure will end up being detailed and complete (along the lines of the "good" Humpty Dumpty index versus the "poorly done" Humpty Dumpty index. If you don't end up with a similar index structure as the "good" index version, it means that you are not following the indexing methodology as well as you might be. This method is basically fool-proof when all of the method components are consistently applied.
    

Software tips:

-   Cindex allows an indexer to add entries and edit the index using the same screen. This is recommended in order to facilitate using The Berkeley Method of Indexing.
    
-   Macrex also allows an indexer to add entries and edit the index in the Inspect Menu. It is recommended that you work in the Inspect mode and not work in the Add/Edit Menu.
    
-   Sky's tutorial advises moving back and forth between the Data Entry View and the Edit View while working, however it is our recommendation that you instead work primarily in the Data Entry View. Though working in the Edit View can be very helpful for specific tasks, moving back and forth between the Data Entry View and Edit View takes up time and doing so on a regular basis while working can significantly increase your indexing time. This is a time-consuming habit that we strongly recommend against.
