It's a bit funny for me to state preferences, given I've written many indexes in each of the 3, but Sky and Macrex are definitely my favourites. Right now I'm trying to one index in each, going back and forth, to see if I can settle on something (and hope Amber/Elena/Do Mi don't kick me out).

You may want to do some reading on the SkyUsersGroup on Google Groups and read about Sky 7 vs 8 incase you go with Sky. There are some people who strongly prefer 7, they find 8 unstable. I use 8, I'm tempted by 7. I haven't had any of the disasters people describe. I don't know if it's user caused or software caused!

I pretty much go p 1 to page 325 or whatever it is. I might do a few pdf searches, but not often. I often use Do Mi's note of mrbfr, meaning "more before this page" if I've decided to start picking something up and I think there are earlier references to it.

I've now got a keyword, ",fer" for "find earlier refs", that I can't believe it took me until a month or two ago to finally think to create.

Oh that's interesting. I don't do this so much anymore, but Kari Kells recommended I always use !! for notes to myself so I can group on !! and take care of it all at once. !!xpost, !!fer, !!reword?, etc. [don't use !! in macrex though, it's used for checking bad cross refs]

When I'm being thorough, I like to do what Do Mi explains in her book on 'cross checking'. Group on every entry with subheadings to make sure it's consistently double posted. That takes me a VERY long time (hours).

Simply that I'll group on "find" for anything that needs me to go back to earlier points in the book to pick up, "dp" for double-posts, and check those, then any other specific tags, deleting my tag as I go.
