## 7.3 Indexing Expert B

Linda K. Fetters has been a freelance indexer for twenty-five years, specializing mainly in health and biomedical publications. She is the author of _Handbook of Indexing Techniques_, _A Guide to Indexing Software_, and numerous articles on indexing software and other aspects of indexing. She has served the American Society of Indexers (ASI) in the positions of corresponding secretary, vice president, president (1992â€”1993), and administrator. She received ASI's Hines Award in 2001.

### Writing the Index

The first step is to read and mark the text, in two phases. First, I mark page ranges and any figures and tables that need to be included, for as many chapters as I have on hand (since they arrive over a period of weeks or months). This way I familiarize myself with the book and catch typesetting errors. The second phase is to read for concepts, highlighting words and phrases.

The second step is to write entries in CINDEX using the "forest and trees" approach. That is, I first make main entries for the chapter, including subentries. Then I take a second pass to make main entries for the secondary concepts. Often this involves copying a whole block of previously entered headings and flipping main headings with subentries and otherwise changing these entries into the proper form. I phrase the entries at the keyboard and frequently edit them throughout the entry process. I write notes to myself in the index enclosed in asterisks (\*) as a reminder to check problems during the editing process.

I enter cross-references at the same time that I write entries.

When I find in a later chapter that some topic needs to be gathered together in its own main entry, I search for the word or phrase and gather the entries into a group. If it's a large group, I'll print it and mark the ones I want to use in a new heading. Usually, though, I read through the entries onscreen and copy and edit one record at a time to add to the new main entry.

### Editing

While writing entries, I constantly make changes to both main entries and subentries. I frequently change the main entry for all attached subheadings using CINDEX's propagate changes feature. I also select and edit any entry that is visible on the screen, search for repeated words or phrases, and edit for consistency one record at a time. Or, I gather records into a group to modify without accidentally making changes to any other part of the index.

I always check to see how any changes affect an entry's position in the index. It is usually sufficient to inspect the changed entries onscreen and verify that they fit in with the existing entries. **CINDEX's labeling feature allows me to change the color of a group of entries, which makes it easy to find and visually inspect new or modified entries.**

I make all editing changes in CINDEX instead of the final formatted file so that I can use the corrected file for a new edition of the same book or for continuing journal indexes from year to year, using the previous year's (or years') entries as a basis for the new index.

For the final edit, I print the index, read it for sense, and make changes as I go.

If I double-posted entries, I check both locations (cross-checking) to ensure that I have included the same locators at both places. Finding and grouping are very helpful in this procedure.

If I make a large number of changes to the index while editing the first third or half, I reprint the remaining unedited index so that I will be reading the modified entries.

In the final stages of the edit, I spell-check the index using CINDEX's built-in spell checkers. Next I verify cross-references. If there are just a few mismatched references, I'll make corrections by selecting the offending reference from the verify screen. If there are several pages (because I've made references to subentries or because I imported a lot of cross-references from a related file, especially previous years' journal indexes), I'll print the list of offending cross-references for checking.

I search for any asterisks (\*) that I use to mark notes to myself in the index file and delete them. If there are any symbols or diacritics, I make sure they are going to appear in the final index file as desired.

The last step is to save the index in the format required by the publisher. CINDEX has a selection of common typesetting (formatting) codes, or it's easy to make your own code file.
