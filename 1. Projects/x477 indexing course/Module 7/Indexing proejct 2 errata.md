* Need to -   **Include the authors of the article in the index but** **only on the page or pages that the names actually appear on.**  go back and do this!!!! does this mean "outside the parentheses" or any citation at all? 
* **Index all author citations, including those inside the parentheses.**: but not those in the et al? 
* Go back and get the outside-parentheses as substantive discussions? 
* need to check all references that occur over a page break, sI have some that have ranges but not sure if I caught others


# L. M. Andersson's name typo'd as L. A.: 

Pearson, C. M., Andersson, L. A., & Porath, C. L. (2000). Assessing and
attacking workplace incivility. Organizational Dynamics, 123–137.
Pearson, C. M., Andersson, L. A., & Wegner, J. A. (2001). When workers
flout convention: A preliminary study of workplace incivility. Human
Relations, 54, 1387–1420.
***This is wrong - Andersson's middle initial should be M for both of these. It's correct in Andersson, L. M., & Pearson, C. M. (1999).

Pearson, C. M., Andersson, L. A., & Porath, C. L. (in press). Workplace
incivility. In P. Spector & S. Fox (Eds.), Counterproductive workplace
behavior. Washington, D.C.: American Psychological Association.

It is also probably incorrect in the above, unless the author changed their name. 

I have corrected it to L. M. in the index in all cases; please let me know if you would prefer otherwise.  

# Update to publication year
Pearson, C. M., Andersson, L. A., & Porath, C. L. (in press). Workplace
incivility. In P. Spector & S. Fox (Eds.), Counterproductive workplace
behavior. Washington, D.C.: American Psychological Association.

This has now been published, and should be 2005 with page numbers etc added (in addition to changing author initials for Andersson): 
Pearson, C. M., Andersson, L. M., & Porath, C. L. (2005). Workplace Incivility. In S. Fox, & P. Spector (Eds.), Counterproductive Work Behaviour: Investigations of Actors and Targets (pp. 177-200). Washington DC: American Psychological Association.  
http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/10893-008

[does full title need to be included??]
[also the text lists it as "forthcoming"??]


# Missing initial for Schein

Schein, E. (1990). Organizational culture. American Psychologist, February,
109–119.

Should be Schein, E. H. 
https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1990-15978-001

The other Schein citation has the correct initials. I have put it as E. H. in the index.
