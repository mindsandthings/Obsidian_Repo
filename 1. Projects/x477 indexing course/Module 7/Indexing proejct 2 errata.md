* Need to -   **Include the authors of the article in the index but** **only on the page or pages that the names actually appear on.**  go back and do this!!!! does this mean "outside the parentheses" or any citation at all? 
* **Index all author citations, including those inside the parentheses.**: but not those in the et al? 
* Go back and get the outside-parentheses as substantive discussions? 
* need to check all references that occur over a page break, sI have some that have ranges but not sure if I caught others
remember to create a combined index!!!

don't forget the see also's

standardize language (target and instigator singular vs plural)

search for all asterisks and fix
remember ot ad da note re fig, if I index the figure separately

# Errata

* L. M. Andersson's name is given with the wrong middle initial in the following citations: Pearson, Andersson, & Porath (2000); Pearson, Andersson, & Wegner (2001); Pearson, Andersson, & Porath (in press). The correct middle initial is A (see https://doi.org/10.1016/S0090-2616(00)00019-X; https://doi.org/10.1177/001872670154110; http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/10893-008). I have used L. M. in the index. 
* Pearson, Andersson, & Porath is described as forthcoming (page 407) and cited as in press. It has since been published: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/10893-008
* E. H. Schein's middle initial is correct in Schein (1992) but missing for Schein (1990). See https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.45.2.109 I have used E. H. in the index. 
* The article cited as Barsade (in press) has since been published: https://doi.org/10.2307/3094912
* One article is in the references but not cited in the text (O'Leary-Kelly, Paetzold, & Griffin, 2000b). Note that this also affects the use of "2000a" for the other O'Leary-Kelly and colleagues article.
