## Module 7: Developing Your Own Process and Style

Before beginning your second full-length indexing project, you will review the indexing processes of three experienced indexers. Notice how they approach the process and the way in which they use their software as a tool to ensure a complete and well-edited index.

An essential element of competent indexing is having a comfortable yet efficient indexing process. ==As you work to complete this module's indexing assignment, focus on what steps you are taking to ensure that all the text topics are covered in the index, that the entries have logical and thematic relationships to one another, and that the index information is easily accessible.

### Learning Objectives

-   Understand that every indexer develops her or his own approach to the indexing process

-   Appreciate the importance of having an ergonomically correct workstation

-   Apply the principles of term selection and thematic relationships, as discussed in previous modules, to build a strong index structure that contains conceptual topics
