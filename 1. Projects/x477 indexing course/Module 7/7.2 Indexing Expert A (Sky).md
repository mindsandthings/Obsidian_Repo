## 7.2 Indexing Expert A

![notepad](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565849/preview)_From the desk of ... Diane Brenner_  
Diane Brenner is a professional indexer with thirteen years of experience. She produces back-of-the-book and embedded indexes. She is co-editor with Marilyn Rowland of _Beyond Book Indexing_ (2000) and co-author, also with Marilyn, of "Indexing Art History" (in _Indexing Specialties: History_, edited by Margie Towery, 1998). She has served as treasurer of the New England Chapter of the American Society of Indexers.

### Term Entry

For back-of-the-book indexes, I work from formatted hard copy that is mailed to me or that I print from PDF files. I open SKY from an icon on my desktop. Since I've configured SKY to load my most recent index at startup, I open a new index file, set the number of subheadings, and save the file with the name of the current project. I don't worry about formatting at this stage.

My approach to term entry depends on the type of material I am indexing. For computer books, travel books, cookbooks, and other texts with linear and formulaic structures, I start indexing on page 1 and enter headings and subheadings as I go. I read far enough ahead to determine page ranges for the topics under discussion. For more thematically complex books -- such as history, biography, and philosophy -- I read the first chapter and skim the remaining ones before I start. This gives me a handle on possible themes. I mark the text only when there are a lot of personal or place names.

I tend to over-index because I find it is easier to cut than add. I enter terms into SKY's data entry grid as they occur, starting with the main topic and adding appropriate subentries. I don't worry about choosing "perfect" terms, since I am sure to alter, refine, abbreviate, or eliminate them during the editing process. I am, however, very careful when I enter names, foreign words, and scientific terms. Errors with these types of entries are hard to catch later, so I double-check them as I go. I use tabs to navigate from main to subheadings and to move down to the next main entry. I usually put a subheading with every main entry, and I don't worry about orphans. After I complete a section of text, I go back over my entries and, where needed, turn any missed subheadings into main headings.

SKY's "autocomplete" feature makes repetitive entries a breeze and helps me maintain consistency and catch errors. In the past, when I changed a term during the entry process, I sorted the index alphabetically to locate all instances of the term or I used the find-and-replace feature. Recently, however, I learned of a keystroke shortcut -- Ctrl-Alt-Enter -- that, when pressed in the edited field, propagates the change instantly throughout the index. I flag any questionable or incomplete entries (e.g., last names without first names or initials) using bold type or underlining. I sort by page number if I need to go back to the text to reread material associated with specific entries.

I frequently use SKY's drag-and-drop feature or its copy command, especially when I'm indexing computer and travel books in which certain terms are repeated frequently. I also use these tools for acronyms and other cross-references. I enter _see_ and _see also_ references as I go. SKY warns you if these entries are not worded properly, and I make needed changes immediately. Since most of my books have strict length requirements, I regularly check the developing index in the preview pane and keep an eye on the record count at the bottom of the screen. I also use SKY's "statistics" tool to check line counts and other details. SKY saves my work automatically.

### Editing

As I noted above, I do minor editing as I go along, fixing egregious spelling errors and modifying some terms. Before I begin major editing, I copy the file and edit using the copy. This is a bit of extra insurance since SKY has a "snapshot" feature that allows you to return to an earlier version of the index; however, I find it useful to keep a copy of my original over-indexed file in case, as has happened, an editor unexpectedly asks me to add to an index.

I run the spell checker and apply SKY's "remove duplicate entries" feature. After sorting alphabetically, I skim the index to get a handle on how much editing needs to be done, identify problem areas, and decide on my cutting strategy. I might write notes during this process and/or flag questionable entries. Then I run SKY's "error scan" utility to check for improperly worded or circular cross references, orphan subheadings, improperly formed entries, and entries with more than five locators, and I make any corrections. After that, I apply the client's formatting specifications. I choose the sort method, whether I want alphabetic separators or initial capitals, and formatting preferences for locators and cross-references. I might also need to specify type and font size and locator formats for journal and multi-volume indexes.

Then I go through the index very slowly. I check for thoroughness and consistency in meaning and grammar, and make needed cuts. I use SKY's grouping feature to integrate similar concepts, eliminate redundancies, and add or subtract terms. As I review terms, I spot check for locator accuracy. I also address any flagged entries. If I have the PDF files, I might search for important terms to assure thoroughness, or I might search the Internet to fill in first names or initials. While I try to use the author's terminology as much as possible, this process helps me identify any important synonyms I missed. Then I run the error checking screens again.

Once I am satisfied that my index is acceptably complete, I export it into Word to do my final editing. I apply any required templates and idiosyncratic formatting or sort requirements and cut or add terms to achieve the desired length. I perform a routine series of searches for common errors (e.g., double periods, commas preceded by spaces, double parentheses) and run the Word spell check. Finally, I magnify the index using Word's zoom feature (usually 200 percent) and read through it one final time. I try to do this final run-through after my eyes have had a bit of a rest, but often I don't have that luxury. I save the file in whatever format the client prefers and send it electronically using FTP or e-mail.

Although I have used SKY a long time, it has many features to facilitate the indexing process that I haven't tried yet, including macro capabilities, forced sort features, and specialized formatting options. As a member of SKY's active online support group, though, I know where to go for instant and knowledgeable help.
