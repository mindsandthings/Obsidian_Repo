# Module 7 Discussion: Indexing Approach

[Return to Module 7 activities page](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/pages/module-7 "Module 7")

After you have finished your second full length index please reflect on the approach to indexing that you are developing. Are you aware of the steps taken during the writing of the index? What parts of the indexing process do you find to be the most effortless? What parts do you find to be most challenging? What would be most helpful to master these challenging issues? How was indexing a professional, or nonuniversity scholarly, text different from working with the textbook text of Module 5?
