## 7.1 The Individuality of the Indexing Process

It has often been said that given the same text, three competent indexers will write three equally excellent but slightly different indexes. Indexing is a form of writing, and just as individual writers develop their own styles, indexers evolve their own approaches to the indexing process and style. Of course, high-quality indexes, even those with stylistic differences, all have complete coverage of the text topics, easily accessible information, and a strong index structure. Bob Richardson's perspective on the individual indexing process is an accurate and affectionate portrayal of this process:

![notepad](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565849/preview)"In the world of commercial publishing, indexing is a profession that still affords the increasingly rare opportunity to be both independent and creative. When the indexer starts to work, she/he is alone with the text and with her own skill, insight, experience, and depth of understanding. It is one of the last truly professional experiences to be entirely responsible for the quality of one's work on one's own terms. Of course there are publishers' guidelines and house standards, but in the final cut it's the indexer, all alone with the book (often late in the night), who brings forth this delicately balanced, complex tapestry called an index. And at its best, it is very, very satisfying . . ."

_Robert J. Richardson's professional background includes a BsEE in Electrical Engineering and a master's degree in Library Science. Bob has over twenty-five years' experience as an electrical engineer and an information specialist with Raytheon. Bob has been a freelance indexer, working in the physical sciences, since the early 1990s._

In Module 5 you were introduced to The Berkeley Method of Indexing. While it is my belief that it is a particularly efficient approach to index, there is no indexing "law" that requires you to follow it. Whatever indexing approach you do end up developing should be one that best fits your personal style.

For example, some indexers may prefer to "mark their page proofs" (write preliminary notes and/or entries) or, if they prefer to work from the screen instead of page proofs, they may highlight text or write notes in the .pdf. There is absolutely nothing incorrect about either practice, but there is also absolutely no doubt that both practices take more time than not marking, highlighting, or making notes and will increase the time you spend indexing. And remember, increased indexing time equals less per hour income. So it is important for you to understand that every decision you make, related to your indexing methodology, will either increase or decrease how much you make per hour, and likely your annual income.

That said, it is equally important for you to accurately assess how those same indexing decisions may impact the quality of your index. Increasing your speed, by sacrificing quality, is not a good tradeoff as the long-term outcome will be less and less repeat work from editors who are dissatisfied with an inferior index done in haste. Your goal is to be as _time-efficient as possible without sacrificing indexing quality._ You should be prepared to continually access how your indexing methodology impacts your index quality and adjust as needed.

In order to expose you to other indexing approaches, in the following topics, you will be introduced to three experienced indexers who, in their own words, describe their individual indexing process. As you review their comments, note that they may differ in how they approach some of the indexing tasks. Every indexer, just as these three indexers have successfully done, must fashion a personal indexing process that is efficient, complete, and comfortable to use. Though it can be helpful to be exposed to another indexer's methodology, remember that your goal is to develop a methodology that will allow you to write the best index you can while still making a living wage. Realistically this will take time and practice, but consider that it takes less time to develop good habits than it does to break bad habits. This course is an opportunity to start trying things out, find out what works best for you, and form good indexing habits that will serve you well throughout your career.

For those of you who are curious about which of the featured indexers follow a similar indexing process as The Berkeley Method, Do Mi Stauber's indexing approach, described in Topic 7.4 of this module, is quite comparable. And in Module 8.4, where you'll find three more explanations by indexers on their own indexing approach, Lucie Haskins' Â "macro and micro" method (within each text chapter instead of having to backtracking through the entire text), is also a similar and equally efficient approach. You'll notice that almost all of the indexers self-describe themselves as "editing as they go along" as per the Example 2 indexing methodology described in Module 5. It is only Do Mi and Lucie's approaches that are similar to the Example 3 concurrent term selection and editing process. Once again, I emphasize that all of these indexers' indexing process can result in equally high-quality indexes, it is the efficiency of their indexing processes that are different. Remember, _indexing efficiency results in a higher annual income._

You may wonder why we have divided the indexer explanations into two different modules instead of having them all in this module. The reason for this is the Module 8 explanations are focused on how the indexer uses the features of CINDEX, MACREX, or SKY. Learning to index can be overwhelming due to having to learn rules, conventions, software, and methodologies seemingly all at once. So, in an effort to facilitate the learning process, we have "chunked" the information in this way. Taking things step-by-step, as individual learning blocks, has proven to be the most successful way to train new indexers. So don't get discouraged even though there is a lot to learn -- you'll get there!
