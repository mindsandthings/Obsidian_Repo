Many of you will find that past work and/or voluntary experience can be transferred to the business of indexing. Review your own work and/or volunteer history, and then list three experiences which may have prepared you to build an indexing career. For example, do you have experience negotiating contracts? Or do you have marketing or cold call experience? Are you comfortable working without supervision and meeting deadlines? Thinking about your work and/or volunteer history, and understanding the depth of knowledge and skills you have developed, will help you to prepare to build a freelance indexing business.

1. I have met deadlines and worked without or with minimal supervision, during graduate school, as a data manager, and in volunteer work.    
2. I have a wide variety of writing experience (academic writing, essays, technical support documents) as well as some editing experience, which will help me communicate more effectively with authors and editors.   
3. My writing, data management, and tech-related work have all involved a level of detail orientation similar to that involved in constructing indexes. This level of detail orientation is also helpful when doing complex, unfamiliar tasks for the first time, such as setting up a business.
