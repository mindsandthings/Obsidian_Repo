Many of you will find that past work and/or voluntary experience can be transferred to the business of indexing. Review your own work and/or volunteer history, and then list three experiences which may have prepared you to build an indexing career. For example, do you have experience negotiating contracts? Or do you have marketing or cold call experience? Are you comfortable working without supervision and meeting deadlines?
