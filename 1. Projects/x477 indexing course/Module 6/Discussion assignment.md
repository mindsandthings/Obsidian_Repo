Many of you will find that past work and/or voluntary experience can be transferred to the business of indexing. Review your own work and/or volunteer history, and then list three experiences which may have prepared you to build an indexing career. For example, do you have experience negotiating contracts? Or do you have marketing or cold call experience? Are you comfortable working without supervision and meeting deadlines? Thinking about your work and/or volunteer history, and understanding the depth of knowledge and skills you have developed, will help you to prepare to build a freelance indexing business.

1. I have substantial experience working without supervision and meeting deadlines, both during graduate school and while working as a data manager. I have been writing from home for a number of years, and have developed routines that help me stay on task without needing external supervision. 
2. I have a wide variety of writing experience, including academic writing and essays for lay audiences, and also nonfiction editing experience. This helps me better understand authorial goals, perspectives, and anxieties, which will help me both market myself to, and communicate effectively with, both authors and editors. 
3. My writing, data management, and tech-related work have all required a level of detail orientation similar to that required to write and proof an index. This level of detail orientation is also helpful when doing complex, unfamiliar tasks for the first time, such as setting up a business.
