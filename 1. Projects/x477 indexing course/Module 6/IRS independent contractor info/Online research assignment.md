Independent contractors 


1. A business does not have behavioral control over an independent contractor: the company can specify the work to be produced (the index and its format) but can't specify when, where, or how an independent contractor does the work. For example, they can specify a style guide a finished index must comply with, but they cannot prohibit an independent contractor from working on the index at 4 a.m. at home while wearing pajamas and eating peanut butter from a jar with a spoon. 
2. A business does not have financial control over an independent contractor. For example, they can't prevent an independent contractor from advertising their services to other businesses or authors. 
3. An independent contractor has the possibility of incurring a loss. For example, if an indexer's home office and equipment is destroyed in a catastrophic event and not insured, the indexer takes the loss, not the business whose index they were working on.  
4. Independent contractors are hired for a specific project or period, while employees can also be hired for a relationship that will continue indefinitely. 


1.  [Behavioral](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/behavioral-control "Behavioral Control"): Does the company control or have the right to control what the worker does and how the worker does his or her job?
2.  [Financial](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/financial-control "Financial Control"): Are the business aspects of the worker’s job controlled by the payer? (these include things like how worker is paid, whether expenses are reimbursed, who provides tools/supplies, etc.)
3.  [Type of Relationship](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/type-of-relationship "Type of Relationship"): Are there written contracts or employee type benefits (i.e. pension plan, insurance, vacation pay, etc.)? Will the relationship continue and is the work performed a key aspect of the business?
