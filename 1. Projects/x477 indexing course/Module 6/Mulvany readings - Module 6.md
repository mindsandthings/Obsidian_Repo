Edit: 
1. Evaluate main headings. Do they make sense, are they clear and concise, are they worded in the way readers will look them up, are they consistent, are there any strings of >5 locators.   
2. Evaluate subheadings for clarify and conciseness. Do they make sense, are they worded in a way readers will likely look up, are they necessary. Typical candidates for editing are the single subheading under a main entry and the group of subheadings that all have the same page number. 
3. Cross-references. Verify each cross-reference; ensure each one leads directly there. If they send you elsewhere in the index to only one or two locators, double-post instead. 
4. Double-posting: verify that they are mirror images of each other. 

Copyedit and proofread: 
1. Alphabetize correctly and check publisher's style guide
2. Spelling
3. Accuracy of reference locators, including appear in ascending numeric order, roman then arabic
4. Parallel construction: consistent grammatical format
5. Punctuation: check in accordance with the publisher's style guide. 
6. Capitalization
7. Format of the index (indention levels)
8. Cross-reference format and placement
9. Special typography (titles of works usually in italics, etc)
10. QUery resolution (e.g. inconsistent spellings of someone's name) - don't leave till end, contact editor immediately
11. INtroductory note - special customs, portions of text not indexed. Make as succinct as possible. 
12. Submmission format

Index length:
Editor shouldprovide # pages available, approximate characters per line, and number of columns per page. 

Accuracy-checking: look up 10% of entries at random; if 1-2 inaccurate are discovered, check another 10%; if no additional inaccuracies are found, the first group is anomalous, but if any are found, check the entire index. 

Tips to reduce the length of an index:
* Determine the percent reduction / # of lines needed to eliminate
* Indented-style: eliminate sub-subheadings
* Subheadings followed by only 1 page number can be eliminated and their locators pulled up to the main heading they modify
* Look at rephrasing turnover lines to shorten them
* If additional deletion is needed, can delete See also's to obviously related topics, but retain if at all possible. 
* Don't consolidate page numbers if they're separate topics. 
* Afterward, check changed entries for alphabetization and re-confirm all cross references.
