## 6.11 Delivering the Index

These days, the single-column, single-spaced index is almost always delivered to the client via e-mail attachment of an RTF file, or increasingly as a Word file. There may be some clients who have special coding that they want included in the file. You may notice a publisher guideline on delivering the index on a disk via overnight delivery. Such an instruction just indicates that the publisher guidelines havenâ€™t been updated to reflect the current email attachment delivery practice.

If you need to submit a revised index for whatever reason, be sure to use a different file name by adding the date or 'revised' or 'version x.' That way there will be less possibility of the editor confusing the files and having the wrong version published.
