Independent contractors 


The company can specify the work to be produced (the index and its format) but can't specify how I produce it. For example, they can specify a style guide the finished work must comply with, but they cannot prohibit me from working on the index at 4 a.m. while wearing pajamas and eating peanut butter from a jar with a spoon. 

Similarly, they can't specify my work process. For example, the number of processes I do or don't make through the material to be indexed is up to me, not to the company.
