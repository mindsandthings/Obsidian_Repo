Instructions are as follows:

-   Indexes are to use letter-by-letter sorting.
-   First names should be spelled out.
-   Follow the instructions in CINDEX, MACREX, and SKY to correctly insert the necessary diacritics.
-   Check the names using a reference such as _Webster's New Biographical Dictionary_ or _New Oxford Dictionary of English_, or online sources such as The National Library of Australia [Trove (Links to an external site.)](http://trove.nla.gov.au/), [The Library of Congress (Links to an external site.)](http://www.loc.gov/), and the [Virtual International Authority File (VIAF) (Links to an external site.)](http://viaf.org/) from OCLC, which links directly to the national catalogs of many nations. As part of the assignment, please indicate which sources you used and why you elected to use them over another source.
-   Create two files for _each_ index: one from the indexing program (CDX, MBK) and one .rtf file.
-   You will be turning in six separate files. Be sure to name each .rtf file by indicating the software used, your name, and the course number, like so: "your name X477 CINDEX exercise3.rtf". Then attach the six files to your assignment submission.

[Submit Exercise 3 here](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/assignments/26460020 "Indexing Exercise 3")
==add:
I used VIAF (the American entries) because it allowed me to see how consistent a particular usage was across nations. When the name in the exercise didn't clearly come up in VIAF (for example Sun Ch'üan) I googled to attempt to determine who was being referred to (and in that case found Encyclopaedia Britannica listing Sun Ch'üan as the Wade-Giles spelling of Sun Quan).  

I modified the VIAF results in some instances:
1. Omitting the "Lady" from Grizel Baillie, per Chicago Style
2. For Sun Ch'üan, using the Wade-Giles spelling as given, rather than going with VIAF's Sun Quan, per Chicago style
3. Omitting the title "Sultan of the Turks" under Chicago 16.37
4. Omitted the title "Doctor" from von Lamont

There are a couple things I would verify with the client, if this were a real job:
1. Rodolfo Amedeo Lanciani's middle name is spelled differently in the given entry than in VIAF (Amadeo in the entry, Amedeo in VIAF). If it were "Amadeo" in the text, I would note to the client that it appeared to be a typo. 
2. If it were not clear from the text who Sun Ch'üan is, I would confirm with them. 





Please share some of the challenges you found in completing Exercise 3 and answer the following questions:

1.  Was it difficult to identify the correct sorting order of names? How easy or difficult did you find it to insert the diacritics using the indexing software?

2.  Please share some of the Web sources, in addition to the recommended ones, you used to identify the surnames and sorting order of the names. Which sources did you find to be the most helpful?
3.  If you were able to find all of the needed information in the recommended websites, which sources did you find to be the most helpful?
