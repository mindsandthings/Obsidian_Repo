Instructions are as follows:

-   Indexes are to use letter-by-letter sorting.
-   First names should be spelled out.
-   Follow the instructions in CINDEX, MACREX, and SKY to correctly insert the necessary diacritics.
-   Check the names using a reference such as _Webster's New Biographical Dictionary_ or _New Oxford Dictionary of English_, or online sources such as The National Library of Australia [Trove (Links to an external site.)](http://trove.nla.gov.au/), [The Library of Congress (Links to an external site.)](http://www.loc.gov/), and the [Virtual International Authority File (VIAF) (Links to an external site.)](http://viaf.org/) from OCLC, which links directly to the national catalogs of many nations. As part of the assignment, please indicate which sources you used and why you elected to use them over another source.
-   Create two files for _each_ index: one from the indexing program (CDX, MBK) and one .rtf file.
-   You will be turning in six separate files. Be sure to name each .rtf file by indicating the software used, your name, and the course number, like so: "your name X477 CINDEX exercise3.rtf". Then attach the six files to your assignment submission.

[Submit Exercise 3 here](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/assignments/26460020 "Indexing Exercise 3")
add:
I used VIAF because it allowed me to see how consistent a particular usage was across nations, including the US and the nation of origin. When the name in the exercise didn't clearly come up in VIAF (for example Sun Ch'üan) I googled to attempt to gather nationality and time period.  

I'm assuming that the names given reflect their usage in the text, so I have used VIAF to support decisions about inversion, alphabetization, and cross-references rather than decisions about what elements to use vs omit (for example, I have retained the "Arcadio" in José Arcadio Limón). VIAF was also less reliable about Asian names, using a comma between family name and given name as though they were always initially given in Western format ("Sun, Yat-sen"; "Soka, Choguan"). Since those names were given in traditional format here, per Chicago style I have not inserted a comma. 

There are three entries I believe to contain typos. If this were a real job, I would verify with the client.  
1. Julien Offroy de La Mettrie ==google?
2. Rodolfo Amedeo Lanciani's middle name is spelled "Amadeo" in the assignment but "Amedeo" (with an e) in VIAF and other sources. I believe "Amadeo" is a typo, and have gone with "Amedeo" in the index. ==google?
3. Alfonso Quiñónez y Molina: The "y" does not appear in official sources. "Alfonso Quiñónez y Molina" gets 4 hits on google; "Alfonso Quiñónez Molina" gets 12,200 hits on google. I believe the "y" is  incorrect, and have gone with "Quiñónez Molina" in the index. 





Please share some of the challenges you found in completing Exercise 3 and answer the following questions:

1.  Was it difficult to identify the correct sorting order of names? How easy or difficult did you find it to insert the diacritics using the indexing software?

2.  Please share some of the Web sources, in addition to the recommended ones, you used to identify the surnames and sorting order of the names. Which sources did you find to be the most helpful?
3.  If you were able to find all of the needed information in the recommended websites, which sources did you find to be the most helpful?
