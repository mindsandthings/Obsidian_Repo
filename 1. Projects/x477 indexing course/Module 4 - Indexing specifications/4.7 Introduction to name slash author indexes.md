## 4.7 Introduction to Name/Author Indexes

_Portions originally published as "A Rose by Any Other Name,"_ Psychology of Sociology Indexing _(Information Today, 2002), by Sylvia Coates. Reprinted with permission of the author._

Name/author indexes initially appear to be a simple matter of listing the name or author citations in the text. But you must consider numerous issues when constructing this kind of index. Unfortunately, while there are many copyediting and proofing style guides, none of them, with the exception of Chicago_,_ discusses or makes recommendations for indexes.

Some publishers have their own indexing style guides, while others leave it to individual editors to instruct indexers on the required documentation. Still other presses will ask the indexer to use her or his "best judgment" for all formatting decisions. This reality places an enormous burden on the indexer to maneuver through the often complex issues of indexing specifications. This is especially true for creating name and author indexes.

"Name index" and "author citation index" are often used as interchangeable terms, but they are, in fact, different. A name index includes all names found in the text. An author index, on the other hand, is made up of only the authors cited in the text.

Let's take, for example, a text that covers the history of Henry VIII of England. If the editor has asked for an author index, the names included in the index would be the names of authors who have written about the reign of Henry VIII and are cited during the discussion. All other names, including "Henry VIII," would be included in the subject index. However, if the editor has asked for a name index, then all names, authors, and any other named individuals would be included in the name index. Therefore, it is important to clarify with the editor exactly what is being requested -- an author or a name index.

Name/author indexes, unlike subject indexes, do not contain subheadings, regardless of the number of page references. Also, the vast majority of editors who request name/author indexes specify that first initials, instead of spelled out names, be used in the index.

![notepad](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565849/preview)In my experience of indexing psychology books, I've found author indexes are common requests. But there may be occasions when the editor wants a name index. Also, psychology books may have numerous instances of organizations cited as authors, and some editors may expect that these organizations be included as author citations in the index. It's prudent to check with your client regarding this issue.
