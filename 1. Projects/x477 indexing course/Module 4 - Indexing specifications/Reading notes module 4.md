Noeline Bridge (2002)'s six patterns of name problems:
1. Order in which to enter names
2. Length or brevity of names
3. One-word names
4. Distinguishing between names that are similar
5. Names that change
6. Spelling of transliterated names

The American Library Association's Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (2002) is a primary reference source for personal names.

One of the most comprehensive sources of reference information is Hazel Bell's Indexing Biographies (2004); chapter 15 addresses printed reference erence works, and the appendix prepared by Noeline Bridge discusses Internet resources. Noeline Bridge's article "Verifying Personal Names on the Web" (2003) includes useful online sources, some of which are cited below.

## Personal names
It is very bad form to have a surname standing alone as an entry, even if the author wrote it like that. 

In the United States the primary authority for entry format of names is the Library of Congress catalog (http://catalog.loc.gov/). If the name cannot be located there, library brary catalogers are apt to look up how the name is handled in The New Encyclopaedia Britannica (http://www.britannica.com), Academic American Encyclopedia (1990), and The Encyclopedia Americana (1990). If the name is entered the same way in all three of these sources, then that is the form used. If the form varies in these sources, the form in The New Encyclopaedia dia Britannica generally takes precedence. Another useful resource is the Columbia Encyclopedia (2000), also made available online by Columbia University's Project Bartleby (http://www.bartleby.com/65/). For general purposes another reference choice is Merriam-Webster's Biographical Dictionary (1995). The Librarians' Index to the Internet (http:// lii.org) has a "People" section that lists biographical dictionary Web sites. There are also many specialized references for different fields, such as the Who's Who series, the New Catholic Encyclopedia (2003), Encyclopaedia dia Judaica (1972), and The Oxford Classical Dictionary (Hornblower and Spawforth, 2003), to name a few. The Getty Research Institute provides the Union List of Artist Names (1994) online at: http://www.getty.edu/ research/conducting_research/vocabularies/ulan/. The Web sites of the Canadian and American indexing societies (see appendix B) also contain useful lists of online resources.

==Ask for the bibliography and clarify that you want it for reference, in order to get names from it; it need not be typeset. 

## Pseudonyms
Pen names, or to be less well-known after disgrace. If the text does not mention the real name, the indexer need not provide a reference to it (e.g., don't mention Samuel Clemens if the author doesn't). 

It may be helpful to add the pseudonym in parentheses after a real name in some cases (pseudonym: Amanda Cross) so readers know they've found the right reference. 

### Names that change
The indexer must decide whether to provide a cross-reference from an earlier name to the current one. The text should be helpful. Don't track down people's genealogical roots. 

In historical or genealogical works indexers may include a womari s maiden name in parentheses and provide a cross-reference to her married name: 

Agee, Victoria (Powers) 
Powers, Victoria. See Agee, Victoria

==[START HERE]

###  Compound names
Names that are composed of three or more name elements, sometimes with the last two joined by a hyphen, are compound names. 

Do note that a distinction is made between a compound surname and a surname that includes articles or prepositions. 

If there is a preferred or commonly known form of a compound name, it should be alphabetized under the preferred element. 

If the element preceding ing the last surname element is usually presented as an initial, this is an indication that the abbreviated element should not be used for alphabetizing.

When a compound surname is hyphenated, the name is alphabetized under the first element.

1. Look to the text
2. Check the reference sources mentioned earlier
3. If the person's language is English or one of the Scandinavian languages, enter under the last part of the name (AACR2)

With married women's names, sometimes it's a maiden name + husband's surname, and the husbands surname is the recommended element for entry, but sometimes the women swaps the two, in which case still enter the name under the final element

Use the first element of the compound if the surname is Czech, French, Hungarian, Italian, or Spanish (AACR2 22.5C5).

### Names with "Saint"
With "Saint/St." the question is whether to abbreviate "St." as spelled out, a quirk that has become common practice, but Mulvany recommends otherwise as it does not suit the user's needs. 

### Christian saints
Enter under a different element of the name; see The New Catholic Encylopedia (2003) as a reference. 

### Names with "Mac," "Mc," or "M'"
Chicago recommends letter by letter, as they appear, with contractions filed as given. 

When names that sound alike may be spelled differently, a reference from one to the other may be necessary, for example "fford see also Ford" (Booth and Piggott).

### Titles in names
If two entries are identical, a title can be used effectively to distinguish between the two. 

Smith, John
Smith, John (Capt.)

Some style guides require clerical titles be retained and others drop them. If retained, use the highest ranking title. 

Booth and Piggott: for Dame, Sir, Lord, and Lady, place the title in front of the forename: Maddocks, Lady Jane. When the wife of a knight or baronet is given the title "Lady," place it after the forename: Hunt, Mary, Lady. But if the woman is the daughter of a duke, duchess, marquess, marchioness, earl, or countess, place the title before the forename. If the individual has a title of honor but doesn't use it, omit the title. 

Booth and Piggott (1988) reommend:
the current edition of Who's Who
Valentine Heywood's British Titles (1951)

Hazel K. Bell (2004, 88) recommends Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History tory of the Peerage, Baronetage, and Knightage (n.d.) and Debrett's People of Today (n.d.). David Lee's article (r99r), "Coping with a Title: The Indexer and the British Aristocracy," is also recommended.

AACR2 provides suggestions for handling names of persons who acquire quire new titles or disclaim titles (22.6B3). The Chicago Manual of Style recommends, ommends, "Princes and princesses are usually indexed under their given names. Duke, earls, and the like are indexed under the title" (2003, 18.38). Furthermore, it is suggested that "Lord," "Lady," "Sir," and "Dame" not be included in the index entry unless the title is necessary for identification. If they are used in the index, these titles are ignored in alphabetizing.

### Names followed by abbreviations
PhD or MD: not retained in index. If Jr, Sr, III, retained but place after the forename. 

Kennel names: this is complicated. 

### Names with only a forename
A name that does not include a surname can be indexed under the given name. Include modifying phrases to distinguish from other same ones, e.g. 

Charles II, King of France
Charles II, King of Great Britain

### Roman names
AACR2 recommends that a Roman living before AD 476 be entered under der the part of the name that is most commonly used (22.9): 

Cicero, Marcus Tullius 

If the text is unclear or there is any doubt regarding the element to use for entry, the recommendation is to enter the name in uninverted order: 

Martianus Capella

### Obscure names

Sometimes a text makes reference to an individual by only a forename or a surname. If such references are indexable and the full name cannot be ascertained, the name is entered as given in the text and further identified fied by a qualifying phrase: Sarah (Lady Jane's handmaid)

## Names with particles
See more detailed reference sources when you have more than a handful of such names.

### General rules
If a surname contains articles or prepositions or a combination of the two, the portion of the name most commonly used should be the basis for alphabetizing. Look to the use in the text, then if needed refer to a biographical dictionary. 

Afrikaans: enter under the prefix (Du Plessis, Menan)

Also see the helpful information provided by Cynthia Bertelsen in Issues in Cataloging Non-Western Materials: Special Problems with African Language guage Materials (1996).

American and English: enter under the prefix (De Peyster, Abraham)

Dutch: enter under the prefix if the prefix is "ver"; otherwise, enter under the name following the prefix (Brink, Berhard ten; Ver Boven, Daisy)

French:  If the prefix in a French name consists of an article or a contraction of an article and a preposition, the prefix should be used for alphabetizing. If the prefix is a preposition, the part of the name following the preposition tion should be used. 

Aubigne, Theodore Agrippa d' 
Du Bos, Charles 
La Fontaine, Jean de 
Toulouse-Lautrec, Henri de 

In the case of a compound French surname, AACR2 recommends that the name be entered under the first element (22.5C5).

### German
Enter German names under the prefix when the prefix consists of an article or a contraction of an article and a preposition. Otherwise, enter under the name following the prefix. 

Am Thym, August 
Beethoven, Ludwig van 
Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von 
Richthofen, Manfred von 
Zur Linde, Otto

### Hungarian
Many indexing guides (The Chicago Manual of Style 2003, 18.77) direct that Hungarian names be presented with the surname first, followed by a forename. The name is entered in the index in the same form, with a comma inserted after the surname. Thus, the text reference for Molnar Ferenc is cited in the index as Molnar, Ferenc

Section 22.15B2 of AACR2 advises, "Include the enclitic né attached to the names of some Hungarian married women." Additionally, in the case of a compound Hungarian surname, AACR2 recommends that the name be entered under the first element (22.5C5).

### Italian
Modern itallian names are entered under the prfix (e.g., De Martini). For medieval names, determine whether the prefix is part of the name (de, de', degli, dei, de li are rarely part of the surname). For compound names, enter under the first element. 

### Portuguese
Do not alphabetize the prefix of Portuguese names; enter it under the element following the prefix. 

### Romanian

Use the prefix for alphabetizing, except for "de", in which case you should use the following element.

### Scandinavian
If the prefix is of Scandinavian, German, or Dutch origin, alphabetize under the name following the prefix. If the prefix is the Dutch de or is of other origin, however, enter the name under the prefix.

### Spanish
If an article is the only element in the prefix of a Spanish name, it should be used for alphabetizing: Las Heras, Manuel Antonio 

Other names are entered on the element following the prefix. Figueroa, Francisco de In the case of a compound Spanish surname, AACR2 recommends that the name be entered under the first element (22.5C5). Delfina Molina y Vedia de Bastianini is entered as Molina y Vedia de Bastianini, Delfina

When a double family name is used and joined with a y, alphabetize under the first element. 

## Non-European names
Cross-references to alternative forms of a name should be provided when the author has used them in the text. It is not the indexer's job to impose a consistent transliteration system on the index when such consistency is lacking in the text.

For more information about various transliteration schemes see "Languages guages Usually Transliterated (or Romanized)" in The Chicago Manual of Style (2003, 10.89-129), Wellisch (1995,421-429), and ALA-LC Romanization ization Tables.

### Arabic
Geography is important: many Islamic names are derived from Arabic but the geography is relevant. 

Modern Arabic names should be inverted. Last names beginning with al- or el- should have the al- or el- at the start, but ignored for alphabetizing (al-Jamal under J). 

Prefixes that indicate relationships, like Abd, Abu, Bin, and Ibn, should not be transposed and should be alphabetized. 

Lacking guidance from the text, the indexer may turn to AACR2 (22.22), The Encyclopaedia of Islam (Gibb 1960), or Concise Encyclopedia of Islam (Gibb and Kramers 2001). Online resources that may be helpful ful include Columbia University Library's Middle East and Jewish Studies ies Web site (http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/indiv/mideast/cuvlm/) and the Middle East Virtual Library (http://ssgdoc.bibliothek.uni-halle. de/vlib/html/).

### Burmese

Surnames are not used in Burmese. If a Western name precedes the Burmese name, move it to the end and use the Burmese name for the entry element. 

Terms of address are often included in a name, especially "U, and are retained in the index listing. Be careful to distinguish terms of address from the same words used in a name. 

### Chinese
Chinese names are usually presented with the surname first; in the index, present them as given, without inversion and without comma. If it's been Westernized (given name then surname), invert in the index. 

Pinyin romanization is used today, but if some books also contain Wade-Giles, cross-references from one format to the other may be helpful. 

### Hebrew
For Jews in Palestine since 1880 and Israel since 1948, names are generally treated like western names. Hebrew names of pre-early-19th century jews are generally always forname followed by patronymic or epithet or both, and are indexed by forename: Akiba ben Joseph

### Indian
Modern Indian names generally appear with the surname last and are inverted in the index. Exceptions in Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu do not contain surnames; enter under the given names. (Often the given names are preceded by a place name, sometimes by the father's given name, and sometimes by a caste name). Persons living before the middle of the nineteenth century should be entered under the first element of their personal name (AACR2 22.25A1). 

### Indonesian
Javan names consist only of a personal name and should be indexed in that manner. Other indonesian names frequently consiste of >1 element and are often entered under the last eleement of the name. There are many exceptions. See AACR2 (22.26C-22.26F) for further discussion. They may also include titles and honorific words in the text. 

### Japanese
If in Western format in the text, invert with comma. If in traditional format, index uninverted, without comma. 

### Malay
Enter under the first element of the name unless the person uses another element as a surname: 
A. Samad Said
A.L. Bunggan
Rejab F.I. 

### Russian
Russian names are forename, patronymic, and family name: Ivan Petrovich Smirnov is indexed as Smirnov, Ivan Petrovich. However, he would be addresses as forename and patronymic but not family: Ivan Petrovich. Make an effort to ascertain the family name. 

### Thai
Use the forename as the entry element because most people are known by and addressed by that name. e.g., enter Dhanit Yupho as Dhanit Yupho, no comma or inversion. Se AACR2 for titles. 

### Vietnamese
Usually composed of three parts, with the surname first, but people are generally referred to by their fornames. General Vo Nguyen Giap is referred to as General Giap, but entered in teh index as Vo Nguyen Giap. Use cross-references. 

Many Cambodian and Laotian names follow the same patterns.
