## 4.8 Name/Author Indexes for Specific Text Types

Name/author indexes are typically required by scholarly and textbook publishers and are seldom found in either documentation or trade book text. Regardless of the kind of press, it is always necessary to clarify the required format with the editor. Never make assumptions regarding the index specifications, because you could end up with an incomplete or incorrectly structured index and an upset client.

Before we begin this discussion it may be informative to review the [_Author Citations and the Indexer_](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565961/download?wrap=1 "Author citations and the indexer article.pdf")

article which reviews the decision making process of including author citations in the index.

### Scholarly Books for University Presses

The next step in writing a name/author index is to establish the required format. University presses typically use Chicago as a style guide, and they usually specify that only names that appear in the body of the text are to be included in the index. Names that appear inside parentheses within the text are excluded from both name/author and subject indexes.

Also excluded from the name/author index, as well as from a combined (subject and author) index, are names that appear in footnotes, endnotes, and references. One important caveat to this rule is to include individuals who are discussed _at length_ in either footnotes or endnotes, not simply cited or mentioned in passing. However, the usual footnote rule of excluding "continued discussion" still applies. In other words, if a discussion in the footnote is simply an extension of the same page text discussion, there is no need to include a footnote page citation in addition to the regular page reference.

![notepad](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565849/preview)Again, there can be exceptions. Recently, a university press editor requested that I not only list all author citations within the body of the text -- including those in parentheses -- but also the authors listed in the references. This particular index was for a psychology text, and the author had requested this format, citing the tenure issue**\***Â as the reason. While the editor admitted that the author's request went against "her Chicago grain," she was willing to comply with it.

**\*** The criteria for tenure includes having a number of cited publications, so untenured faculty members have a vested interest in being listed in the index as often as possible. Excluding citations found within the parentheses would diminish the number of times an author might be listed in the index. Even tenured faculty, as a result of academia's "publish or perish" culture, will have an interest in being listed.

Multiple author citations are often incompletely cited in the text. For example, there may be numerous authors of a cited title, but only the first or perhaps first two authors will be listed in the text. The remaining authors are cited as _et al._ authors. In other words, the citation may read "Jones, Smith et al." instead of "Jones, Smith, Doe, and Young." In a case like that, university presses do not require that the names of the _et al._ authors "Doe" and "Young" be included in the index. So, for a university press client, the author citations of "Jones" and "Smith" would be listed in the index but not "Doe" or "Young." A professional text publisher (non-university presses) may or may not require the _et al._ authors to be included in the index. Always check with the editor regarding this issue.**\*** The criteria for tenure includes having a number of cited publications, so untenured faculty members have a vested interest in being listed in the index as often as possible. Excluding citations found within the parentheses would diminish the number of times an author might be listed in the index. Even tenured faculty, as a result of academia's "publish or perish" culture, will have an interest in being listed.

The page reference format should be the same as that for the subject index specifications. This is regardless of either the type of text or press.

![Canada flag](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565969/preview)Canadian university press indexes generally consist of names and subjects combined. Author names may be indexed only if there is some discussion of the individuals or their work. On rare occasions some of the legal titles may have two indexes: a subject index and an index of cases.

### Scholarly Books for Non-university Presses

Scholarly books for non-university presses use a variety of style guides. These presses might follow Chicago, APA, or even a style guide developed in-house. (Note, however, that the APA does not include indexing specifications.)

If the style guide used is Chicago, the press will generally follow the same index specifications as a university press. Many presses that do not follow Chicagorequire that author citations inside parentheses be included in the index. Names from footnotes and endnotes are excluded from the index just as for university presses.

![notepad](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565849/preview)Though I have had the occasional request from a non-university scholarly press to include names from the references, generally they are excluded from the index.

  
Page references for these presses are most often all-inclusive, also known as unsquashed (i.e., 110-112 and not 110-12). This is particularly true of the presses that follow style guides other than Chicago_._ But again, there are always exceptions, and it's imperative to check with the editor.The treatment for _et al._ author citations is handled in either of two ways. Some presses will follow the university press practice of excluding these names from the index. However, others require that all of the _et al._ author citations be included in the name/author index, which means that you'll have to check all _et al._ citations in the references to identify and include every author in the index. It's extra work that should be considered in your financial negotiations.

### Textbooks

The format requirements for textbooks often follow Chicago_._ But it's not unusual for textbook editors at presses following Chicago to specify that authors from within parentheses be included in the index.

![notepad](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565849/preview)I've also had requests to include names from the references, though again, this is not a common requirement. Psychology textbooks often require name/author indexes as well as subject indexes. These books may be either for high school students or for undergraduate college students.
