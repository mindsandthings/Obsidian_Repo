## Module 4: Indexing Specifications

A professional indexer is expected to understand and anticipate the requirements of clients. Different clients have different requirements for indexing specifications and formats, depending on the kind of book and the needs of the publisher.

In this module, you will be introduced to information on the different formats for name/author, scripture, poem, and locorum (classical citation) indexes. Emphasis will be on the indexing specifications made by university, professional book, textbook, and tradebook presses. In addition, you will be given material on the use of diacritics (accent marks) and will use indexing software to insert diacritics into provided indexes.
