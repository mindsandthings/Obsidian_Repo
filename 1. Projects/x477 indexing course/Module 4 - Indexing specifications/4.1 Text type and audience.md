## 4.1 Text Type and Audience

Before we discuss text type and the audience, I'd like to introduce Bob Richardson's insightful perspective on the relationship between an indexer and the audience. It is a worthy consideration when approaching the process of indexing.

> "Remember, please, that the indexer is the reader's ombudsman. After the text has been set and the production schedule fixed, only the indexer is left to represent the reader's interests. The indexer is the pilot who helps the reader navigate the uncharted sea of the text. In a 900-page book, this is not trivial."

_Bob has been a freelance indexer, working in the physical sciences, since the early 1990s. The remainder of this commentary is adapted from the "Getting It Right" workshop by Sylvia Coates_.

### Considering Type of Text

An important aspect of term selection is consideration of the audience -- the readers who will be using the index. It's important to select terms by using appropriate language and wording that readers will be most likely to look up when searching the index.

So how does an indexer anticipate who the readers are going to be, the information they are most likely to look up, and the language they will most likely use to search for that information? An easy method is to first consider the type of text you will be indexing. Five major divisions of text are

-   Scholarly (Note: In Australia "academic" is used instead of scholarly.)
-   Textbook
-   Trade book
-   Documentation
-   Journals

Scholarly text can be further divided into books printed by university presses and books printed by non-university presses, but in terms of determining audience, these two subdivisions can be treated in the same way.

![Australia flag](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565761/preview)Academic texts are produced by both university and non-university presses; however, many university presses produce large numbers of non-academic textsâ€“textbooks and trade titles as well.

Note that, unless specifically stated otherwise, the following information applies to Australian, Canadian, and U.S. publications.

### Questions to Ask Regarding Audience

Each of the five major categories of text has a different reading audience, and the authors (who are also audiences you need to consider) have different agendas that need to be reflected in the index. Here are some general questions you should ask yourself regarding text type and audience:

1.  What is the _purpose_ (or function) of the text?
2.  Who will the _readers_ (or audience) be for this text?
3.  What is the _author's agenda_?
4.  How do the above answers affect the _indexing approach_?
5.  What are the typical _indexing specifications_ for this kind of text? (More questions to ask regarding indexing specifications will be outlined in Topic 4.3.)
6.  What is the _production time_? Production time is defined as the time line during which the text manuscript is copyedited, revised, proofed, designed, and otherwise prepared for publication. This time line does not include the amount of time it takes for the author to write the original manuscript.

In the next topic, we'll apply these questions to the four major text categories in order to determine the audience and what the index must provide to those readers.
