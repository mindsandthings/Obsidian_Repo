## 4.2 Determining Your Audience

_Adapted from the "Getting It Right" workshop by Sylvia Coates_

You'll need a general understanding of the audience for each of the major text types in order to tailor your index to the needs of those readers. The basic characteristics of each type of text and its readership are outlined below. You can also view this information in an [abbreviated, tabular format](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/pages/module-4-table "Module 4 Table").

### Scholarly Text

(Both university press and non-university press professional books)

1.  **Purpose:** This sort of text is part of the academic "publish or perish" culture. Often, it is organized to begin with a general hypothesis followed by studies, or a series of studies, or arguments that are presented to either support or disprove the hypothesis. This kind of text can be either the work of one or two authors collaborating, or multiple author articles all organized under the same subject. The subject level for this text is upper division college, graduate, or professional.
2.  **Audience:** The readers for this kind of text will be upper division or graduate students, and professional colleagues. Because these readers will be familiar with the subject matter, it is important to include in the index appropriate discipline terminology as well as any new terms coined by the author. Term selection must be very conceptual and include professional jargon. Readers will often use the text as reference material, and the index must allow them to use the text in that capacity. It's advisable for indexers of this kind of material to have a background in the discipline and a familiarity with its vocabulary.
3.  **Author's agenda:** The author's agenda is to participate in the academic "publish or perish" culture appropriate for professional development and advancement. Publishing is necessary for these authors, who are often university faculty members, to attain tenure. Therefore, the authors tend to be very concerned that the index accurately reflects the tone and arguments laid out in the text.
4.  **Indexing approach:** Due to the complex nature of this kind of text, the index will include very conceptual information and professional jargon.
5.  **Indexing specifications:** University presses generally follow Chicago recommendations for the index. Most presses require: run-in formats, letter-by-letter sorting, that only proper nouns be capitalized, Chicago press page reference format, and that _see_ and _see also_ cross-references be capitalized and in italics.
    
    Non-university presses, which publish professional books, do not normally follow Chicago recommendations for the index. This is particularly the case for the treatment of author citations, page reference format, and often-required word-by-word sorting. Indexing specifications are specific to each individual press, and indexers are often provided with an indexing style guideline.
    
    ![Australia flag](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565761/preview)Both university and non-university presses follow their own individual house style, which usually includes word-by-word sorting.
    
    ![Canada flag](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565969/preview)Generally, university presses use Chicago, modified by the specific press as needed. There aren’t as many university presses as are found in the U.S., and they tend to follow the same specifications, except that some have a preference for Hart’s rules format for page references.
    
      
    
6.  **Production time:** For a university press, book production is typically twelve months. The indexing schedule of university press indexes commonly allows three to four weeks between the time the page proofs or PDF files are delivered to the indexer, and the date that the index is due to the editor.
    
    ![Canada flag](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565969/preview)The typical schedule for university press books is around eight months. The time allowed for indexing is between three and four weeks, which is similar to that at U.S. presses.
    
      
    For a non-university or professional book press, the production time line can range from three to nine months. The indexing due date may range from one to two weeks after delivery of the page proofs.

### Textbooks

1.  **Purpose:** This category includes textbooks for K-12 education as well as undergraduate college texts. The function of this text is to be an educational aid in classroom teaching, so the material is instructional in nature. In these texts, main headings and subheadings clearly indicate the subjects being discussed. Terminology is clearly defined in the material, and often these books will have a glossary listing the pertinent vocabulary terms. While glossaries themselves are seldom included in the index, the glossary terms, as listed and discussed in the text, will be included in the index.
2.  **Audience:** The readers for this kind of text are students, teachers, and professional colleagues. The index must contain terminology appropriate for readers at a novice level as well as readers who have a professional-level knowledge.
3.  **Author's agenda:** The author's agenda is to provide instructional material for classroom use and student study.
4.  **Indexing approach:** Students will probably be using the index to answer reference and assignment questions, so the index needs to provide easy access to information through clearly defined terms. As such, it is important for the index terms to reflect the main topics of discussion throughout the text, as well as the glossary terms.
5.  **Indexing specifications:** Textbooks typically follow Chicago specifications, including indented format and letter-by-letter sorting.
6.  **Production time:** Production typically takes from three to nine months, depending on the press and the demands of the specific book publishing schedule. The indexing time line may vary depending on the size of the text and complexity of the project. Textbooks can be anywhere from 200 pages to very large projects of 500 to 1,000 pages. Page proofs are often sent to the indexer in batches of several chapters at a time over a period of several months. Indexes are typically due to the editor two weeks after the delivery of the last page proofs to the indexer.
    
    ![Canada flag](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565969/preview)Often textbooks are a Canadianized version of a U.S. book, which may shorten the production time. However, the index often has to be completely redone and the due date may be two weeks after the delivery of the last page proofs to the indexer.
    

### Trade Books

1.  **Purpose:** These books can be informational, motivational, or for entertainment purposes. Self-help, inspirational, humorous, and instructional books are all included in this category.
2.  **Audience:** The readers for this type of text will be general interest members of the public. Most of these readers will have no special background knowledge of the material. General and common use terminology is appropriate in the index. Indexes should be easy to use because readers will most often be trying to access information that they recall reading in the text. Include multiple access points for the same material throughout the index to facilitate an easy search.
3.  **Author's agenda:** The author's agenda for these kinds of books will vary. It may be to instruct, to inspire, to help or encourage, or simply to entertain.
4.  **Indexing approach:** When indexing these kinds of books, consider the author's agenda and make sure that the index allows the reader to access information on the author's message. This kind of text requires an easy-to-use index that includes both author-specific and general-use terms. Names will be particularly important to include for biographies or autobiographies.
5.  **Indexing specifications:** The specifications may or may not follow Chicago, depending on press specifications.
6.  **Production time:** Trade book press production runs between three and six months. Indexing due dates may range between one and two weeks following the delivery of the page proofs to the indexer.

### Documentation

1.  **Purpose:** This category includes computer software manuals, how-to texts, and instructional types of material. Material produced by corporations for employee training, benefits, retirement programs, and reports for stockholders also fall into this category. This kind of text is informational and instructional in nature.
2.  **Audience:** The readers are interested in instructional information. The index must allow readers to access the instructional, statistical, or specification information in the material.
3.  **Author's agenda:** The author's agenda can be either to inform/instruct (i.e., software manuals), or to influence or send a message (i.e., corporate material).
4.  **Indexing approach:** Special care must be given to include both expert- and novice-level terminology in the index. The index must be easy to use and include multiple access points for the same material.
5.  **Indexing specifications:** These indexes normally have indented format, as well as additional specifications as per publisher requirements.
6.  **Production time:** Production is typically very rapid -- three months or less. Accordingly, indexing due dates are very tight, often just a week or less, and must be strictly adhered to.

### Journals

1.  **Purpose:** This category is typically for reporting on research studies to professional colleagues or reporting on papers presented at professional conferences. Material is produced by higher education organizations, by professional associations, and by both academic and non-academic organizations. This kind of text is informational, may be instructional, and is also used for research dissemination.
2.  **Audience:** The readers will be professional colleagues and/or organization stakeholders.
3.  **Author’s agenda:** The author’s agenda is to inform stakeholders and report on research or projects of interest to the industry, higher education, or organization.
4.  **Indexing approach:** Because the readers will be either professional colleagues or knowledgeable stakeholders, care should be given to use discipline language and/or jargon. Journals are typically made up of multi-authored articles, and it is important to consolidate differing terminology used by individual authors in the index.
    
    There are two approaches to term selection for journals. The first is to select the most appropriate terminology from the text and use See cross-references, as appropriate, to guide the reader to the term used in the index. This approach is used for standalone journals and even for a cumulative annual index of quarterly or monthly journals.
    
    The second way is to use a controlled vocabulary (thesaurus) for selecting index terms. A controlled vocabulary is a restricted and thematically organized list (generally extremely large, with tens of thousands of terms) that the indexer must use to select index entries. Such a controlled vocabulary will be provided by the client to the indexer and must be followed during the term selection process. It is important to note that not all journal projects will require using a controlled vocabulary; whether the indexer will be using a controlled vocabulary will be specified by the client. One such controlled vocabulary tool is the MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) put out by the National Institutes of Medicine in the U.S. The [MeSH (Links to an external site.)](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/) is an enormous thesaurus of terms (25,588 in 2010, plus over 172,000 crosses, plus 190,000 supplementary concepts), and new terms are added every year. Common terms are needed because researchers and policy makers need to be able to do literature searches. The Library and Archives Canada Web site presents the [Government of Canada Controlled Vocabulary Registry (Links to an external site.)](http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/government/controlled-vocabularies/007004-6000-e.html), which lists the most commonly used controlled vocabularies by both Canadian and U.S. publishers. Controlled vocabularies are discussed in greater depth in Module 10.
    
5.  **Index specifications:** Journal indexing specifications do vary from press to press. There may be a specific style for article titles and other entries. Some journal presses will require that all author citations, parenthetical and otherwise, be included in the index, while other journal specifications may exclude author citations. So, in the case of journal indexing, it is of particular importance that all index specifications be clarified with the client. And, should the journal require that a controlled vocabulary be used for the index, that information will also be included as part of the specifications.
6.  **Production time:** Production times vary, but they are much shorter than those for books and may be as little as a couple of weeks or up to 5 months per journal, depending on the publisher and type of journal. There may be times when the production timeline requires that the index use dummy page numbers to index the journal and then substitute the final page numbers within a day or two as the final pagination becomes available. Cindex, Macrex, and SKY all have features that allow an indexer to index first by using dummy numbers and then replacing them with the final page number. This is a relatively quick and easy procedure and one more example of how important an indexing software tool can be.
