## 10.4 Database Indexing

Much of today’s online information is stored in databases, structured collections of records stored in a computer. Think of Amazon.com. All of their information on available products, as well as cumulations of customer activity is kept in a huge database and portions of that database are displayed when a user accesses a particular website page.

The following example is part of the script (captured by clicking on "View" and then "Source" on the toolbar) that displays the pricing for a particular book on Amazon.com. The details of what is happening here aren’t important, just the idea that there are dozens, if not hundreds, of calls to a large database to supply information for just a single page.

function bxgy\_update\_price() {    
   var priceBlock = goN2U.getElement("bxgy\_price\_button\_block");    
   var listPrice = goN2U.getElement("bxgy\_lp");    
   var buyingPrice = goN2U.getElement("bxgy\_bp");    
   var listPriceT = goN2U.getElement("bxgy\_lpt");    
   var buyingPriceT = goN2U.getElement("bxgy\_bpt");    
   var bxgyMap = goN2U.getElement("bxgy\_map");

   priceBlock.className = "bxgyPriceBlock" + (isXChecked+isYChecked+isZChecked) + "Asin";

   if (listPrice && listPriceT) {      
      var listPriceValue = listPrices\[0\]\*isXChecked + listPrices\[1\]\*isYChecked + listPrices\[2\]\*isZChecked;      
      listPriceValueStr = bxgy\_format\_number(listPriceValue);      
      listPrice.innerHTML = listPrice.innerHTML.replace(/(\[\\d\\.,\]+)/,listPriceValueStr);          
      listPriceT.innerHTML = bxgyLPTexts\[isXChecked+isYChecked+isZChecked\];}

Simple databases consist of tables with rows and columns, where each column contains a specific type of information and each row contains the complete information about a specific item. Below is an example of a simple database, created in Microsoft Access, which I use to track information on the indexes I have completed.

More complex databases (called relational databases) include multiple inter-related tables.

In addition to online information, many large databases are available for internal use only within a particular company. These databases may contain customer information or, of particular interest to indexers, documents or product information. (Depending on the company, they may have hundreds or thousands of products.)

Database indexing is used to create index values that are stored in a database along with other information. The material indexed might be in the database itself, such as a product database, or might be external to the database, as in an online index for a print journal.

Mary Wendt, a graduate of the UC Berkeley indexing course, has been a full-time freelance indexer since September 2005. Specializing in the humanities and social sciences, she currently provides database- and book-indexing services to a variety of private and university clients. Before going freelance, she managed a corporate library where her duties included database indexing and abstract writing.

Mary Wendt has this to say about database indexing:

Database indexing involves the indexing of many different forms of materials. Some of these are encyclopedias, journals, newspapers, or collections of documents (primary, corporate, and organization). The goal is to provide electronic access to collections of documents beyond simple full-text searching.

Unlike back-of-book indexing where the indexer works alone, database indexing usually involves multiple indexers working on a project. In addition, the materials within a database may be indexed over a long period. Because of the collaborative and ongoing nature of database indexing, a database indexer must follow detailed guidelines and use a controlled vocabulary to maintain consistency.

However, just as in back-of-book indexing, a database indexer will need to make term selection decisions based on the material at hand and its context. In addition, the CV will require modifications as new material is added to the database or as language develops within a field.

A database indexer is usually paid by the article or document. For some projects, such as thesaurus development, an hourly rate may be used.

The indexing may be done onsite or offsite, depending on the requirements of the particular project, but the indexer is often creating values within the database itself. In this case, arrangements for accessing the database must be worked out in advance with the client, as there are often significant security issues to be dealt with.
