Now that you are finished with the course, do you feel ready to begin indexing professionally? If not, what additional information would you like to have been exposed to during the course? If you have chosen not to pursue indexing, was this course helpful in determining your decision? What factors have led you to feel that indexing is not something youâ€™d like to pursue?

What did you feel was the most valuable information in the course? What was the least helpful?

How did you first learn of indexing? Was it from a friend, reading about it, or from another source? How did you learn about this course?

You will not be graded on the content of your answers but only for completing this discussion assignment.
