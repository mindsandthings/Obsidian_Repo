## 9.1 Embedded Indexing Using Word

When an index is "embedded" in an electronic text, index "markers" are coded into the text, and each marker is mapped to an index main heading. The index is generated at the end of the publishing process, when the text and its pagination are finalized. Embedded indexes can be created for books as well as for websites. To read more about embedded indexing and compare it to the process you've been learning so far, read this article by Lucie Haskins, a summary of working with embedded indexingÂ [_Jumping on the embedded indexing wagon--or should I?_](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565957/download?wrap=1 "Jumping on the embedded indexing bandwagon by Lucie Haskins.pdf")

In this topic, Jan Wright, an indexing professional, describes her process of embedded indexing in Word. First Jan examines the specifications particular to embedded indexing; then she goes through the steps of creating an embedded index in Word.

Please note that CINDEX and SKY can also be used to write embedded indexes for Word documents, but the approach Jan describes below is to embed entries directly into a Word document.

### Embedded Indexing

#### Specifications

The first step in any embedded process is a long discussion with the client. Not only do you need to know the due dates and the style issues, but both of you must be clear on several points:

-   Which software tool or tools are going to be used, and in what order?

-   Is the index going to be mutated from a print version to an online display, and, if so, how will that happen?

-   Is the piece going to be translated?

-   What fonts or typefaces are being used in the files? Make sure you have them installed.

-   How you will pass files back and forth with the client?

-   Will you need the pictures? Sending the pictures if they are linked to the files means a lot of transfer time. If you can work without the pictures (this really depends on the subject matter), you can save the client and yourself some download time.

-   How will the client ensure you have all the files at the same time for compiling the index and editing?

#### The Process

Once you have those matters clear, you can start work. Make sure you have a zip program, such as WinZip, to compress the files or uncompress them when they arrive. At times, it really helps to have a website download service, such as [IBackup![](data:image/svg+xml;base64,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)Links to an external site.](https://www.ibackup.com/index.html), so you and your client can post files outside of e-mail. One or two files can quickly overload your e-mail server.

You should open and check each file that you receive to make sure it does actually open in your software. Duplicate all the files, and store a copy.

Then, if you are more comfortable reading and thinking and marking on printed copies, print the book out. If you can handle working onscreen, you can either work directly on the files in your software, or you can set up a laptop or two-monitor system so you can "flip" forward or back electronically as needed.

Build a small test index to be sure you can predict how your index will look. Include a set of entries like the one below.

![embedded indexing example](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565721/preview)

Once you are satisfied that you can code everything correctly in your program for the desired result, start inserting codes in the pages.

You will usually find that you must think about these issues:

-   **Index markers.** Where will you place your index markers? Often, writers need to rework text in the files, and they find it really hard to work around entries stuck in the middle of sentences. Likewise, translators hate translating entries in the middle of paragraphs. They like to swipe and replace text. So you may want to put your entries all at the beginning of paragraphs, or all at the end. It's your choice. But writers love it when you clump them -- it makes it much easier when they face rework.

-   **Page ranges.** Do we really need to page range for two pages, or should we just do three and above? It's a lot of extra work to page range. You may want to minimize it not only for your work overhead, but also because it simplifies the compiling for the client. Word and some other programs can actually crash when there are too many page ranges for them to process.

-   **Sorting.** Most programs do not handle letter-by-letter sorting, so work around the need for that. Look at your sorting of symbols and numbers, as well. It probably won't be pretty. Most programs do not sort prepositions or hide words from the sort. Rewrite your entries so that they always sort on the most important word. Simplify.

-   **Cross references.** Most programs do not understand that the "See" in a _see_ reference is special. Some do, but many think it is just a word beginning with an S. If you are stuck with a stupid program that will not sort it correctly, try putting all your _see_ references in parentheses. Parens always sort to the top of a list of subheads. This is also a classy way to handle files that will be translated, as the _see_ will float to the top regardless of language.

-   **Punctuation.** Some programs think a comma divides your main heads from your subheads, some think it's a colon, some a semicolon. If your program is confused, rewrite the entry to eliminate the problem punctuation.

-   **Subheads.** Some programs will not let you have more than one locator per subhead. You have to then write a longer index with more subheads.

Remember that in most projects, the compiled index is a snapshot of the entries. That means that when you compile, you see the entries sorted as they are at that moment in the files. If you change pagination, edit an entry, or delete a paragraph, the static compiled index does not reflect those changes. After you compile, don't edit the index text itself; instead, go back and change the entry codes so that the compile comes out right every time. And remember to compile as the last step after you make all of your changes.

Editing is the hardest phase of indexing in embedded work. Allow a lot of time for this stage. I often will work with my screen split so I can see files with entries on the top and the compiled index below, and work through my edits. Or again, side-by-side screens work well; you can display the compiled index and then use your main machine for making the corrections.

Keep recompiling to check your edits -- problems happen that you just would not believe, so check each edit or each small group of edits with a compile.

Then, when you are sure it is perfect, send everything back to the client.
