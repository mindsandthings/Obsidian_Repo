## 9.4 A Quick Look at Indexing in FrameMaker

In the last topic, Cynthia Berman explained her indexing process. Now Cynthia will walk you through examples of indexing in FrameMaker.

### Introduction

FrameMaker has a well-developed indexing tool for entering embedded index entries. In addition, there are plug-in programs, such as IXgen, that turbo-charge FrameMaker's indexing capacity.

It's important to remember that the tool and the environment (the source files) are different. In FrameMaker, you index directly in the source files, and FrameMaker will keep track of page numbers for you. This is one of the attractions of embedded indexing, especially in the software industry. Because you will be working in the source files, you will need to stay in close communication with your contact person to make sure that only one person is writing to a source file at one time.

You will need to feel comfortable with basic operations in FrameMaker, which are remarkably similar to basic operations in other tools. And, of course, you'll need to learn how to use the indexing features. They are straightforward and easy to use.

Remember that good indexing is good indexing whether you are using FrameMaker or dedicated indexing software. The approaches you learn in class will apply in FrameMaker and other tools.

### Marker Box

You enter the index entries directly in the source files using the dialog box, as shown below.

![You enter the index entries directly in the source files using the dialog box, as shown here](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565743/preview)

Notice the syntax of the entry:

-   The main entry is the word _subentries_.
-   The colon (:) is a separator character, in this case separating the main entry from the subentry.
-   The subentry is _orphaned_.
-   The semicolon (;) separates two distinct entries. Using the semicolon between entries lets you enter multiple index entries in the box. In the example, I double-posted an entry. The Marker box is limited to 255 characters for each entry. I did not leave a space after the semicolon; however, you may leave a space if you prefer.
-   The second entry in the box is _orphaned subentries_. It is a main entry with no subentries.
-   To record the entry, you must click New Marker or Edit Marker. Otherwise, your changes will vanish into the ethers.

### Finding Markers in the Text

A sans serif "T" in the text represents a marker. Notice the T-markers in the figure below. In this example, they are all index markers.

![A sans serif T in the text represents a marker](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565891/preview)

However, you cannot always assume that all T-markers are index markers. They can also be other marker types, such as conditional text or hypertext. The T-markers in the next figure are in a Table of Contents and are hypertext markers that link to the chapters.

![The T-markers shown here are in a Table of Contents and are hypertext markers that link to the chapters](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565929/preview)

If you are in doubt about a T-marker, open the Marker Box and then highlight the marker. The Marker Type field will display the type of marker, and the Marker Text box will display the text or code. If you have coded an index entry as Hypertext instead of Index, simply choose Index from the drop-down list and click Edit Marker. This is a common mistake in the beginning.

### Special Building Blocks

FrameMaker uses a series of special building blocks for marking options like page number suppression and page ranges. Some of these building blocks and their uses are listed here.

<table><caption>Building Blocks for Marking Options</caption><tbody><tr><th scope="col">Building Block</th><th scope="col">Description</th><th scope="col">Sample Index Tag</th><th scope="col">Sample Index Entry</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">&lt;$nopage&gt;</th><td>Suppresses a page number, typically in a cross-reference</td><td>&lt;$nopage&gt;Canis lupus</td><td><span>Canis lupus</span></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">&lt;$startrange&gt;...&lt;$endrange&gt;</th><td>Defines a page range</td><td>&lt;$startrange&gt;wolves:maternal instincts of<br>...<br>&lt;$endrange&gt;wolves:maternal instincts of</td><td><span>wolves<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; maternal instincts of, 44-48</span></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">&lt;Emphasis&gt;...&lt;Default Para Font&gt;</th><td>Sets the font to italic and then resets it to the text font</td><td>&lt;$nopage&gt;Canis lupus. &lt;Emphasis&gt;See &lt;Default Para Font&gt;wolves</td><td><span>Canis lupus.

### Conditional Text

Conditional text is text that has been defined in FrameMaker to have a specific appearance. It can be hidden or revealed, depending on the Show/Hide setting.

Each document or delivery mode in a source file is decorated differently on the screen. For example:

-   Red and overlined is for text that pertains only to the base product.
-   Blue and underlined is for text that pertains to a vertical product. (In a vertical product, some of the text from the main, base publication is pulled for a different use.)
-   Black without overlining or underlining is for text that pertains to both the base and vertical products.

Conditional text is how single-source documentation is produced in FrameMaker. It is a very powerful (and colorful) feature.

Just as you can have content coded for multiple conditions, you can have index entries coded for multiple conditions. In the previous example, a feature that pertains only to the vertical product should appear in the index for the vertical product manual, not the base product manual.

When you index material with conditional text, it is usually a good idea to index with all conditions showing. If you are using page ranges, be sure that the page ranges begin and end in the same condition. It's a good idea to avoid page ranges in conditional text because they often get broken during the inevitable last-minute editing/updating cycle. When you are embedding the index markers, remember:

-   Embed common markers in common text (usually black and not decorated).
-   Embed markers for specific conditions in that condition.

After all the markers are embedded, you are ready to generate and edit the index. Some people do a very quick "all conditions showing" edit and then generate and edit for each condition.

### Conditional Text Example

The next figure shows three conditions: black, blue, and red.

![conditional markers that show when you do an all conditions showing edit](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565845/preview)

And the figure below is a sample index generated from these entries.

![sample text generated from conditional markers](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565947/preview)

Below, the red condition has been hidden. When the index is regenerated, the three "red" entries will be suppressed.

![blue conditional markers, red is hidden](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565857/preview)

And the next figure shows the index that was generated when the red condition was hidden.

### Generating the Index

In FrameMaker, entering the index text and generating the index are two separate steps. When you generate the index, you tell FrameMaker to compile the markers into an index. Before you generate the index, it is a good idea to review the index settings on the FrameMaker Reference Pages. You also need to understand how the FrameMaker book file works. Those topics are beyond the scope of this overview.

It is worth noting that you can generate an index for an individual file or for the entire document. Generating an index for a document that contains multiple files requires a book file.

### Editing the Index

You can edit a FrameMaker index by editing entries in the marker. A better, faster way is to use the IXgen plug-in for FrameMaker, as seen in this [IXgen screen shot](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/pages/ixgenscreen "I Xgen Screen").

IXgen presents the entire index as a FrameMaker table that can be edited. The table has full search-and-replace capabilities. After the table has been edited, you apply the edits to the original entries. Then, you can regenerate the index and begin another edit cycle.

Using IXgen reduces the mechanical overhead of editing an index by about two-thirds. It lets me concentrate on editing the content, not updating marker boxes.
