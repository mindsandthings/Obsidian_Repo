## 9.11 E-books, A New Frontier for Indexers

This is Sylvia again -- and I’d like to introduce you to e-books, which are one of the most dynamic innovations currently evolving in today’s publishing industry and will certainly have a huge impact on future of indexers and indexing.  An e-book can be known by many names, including electronic book, ebook, and digital book. E-books are book-length documents or publications in digital form, accessed (or read) using computers or other electronic devices such as a Kindle or smartphones.  E-books can be created from either an existing printed book or as original digital material.

Michael S. Hart, in 1971 while at the University of Illinois, created the first e-book out of the United States Declaration of Independence. Later that same year, he started _Project Gutenberg_, a volunteer effort to save books in digital form. It is the oldest digital library and, as of 2011, currently claims over 36,000 e-books. The collection is made of public domain texts for which copyright has expired, allowing free use of the material.  _Project_ Gutenberg has evolved internationally, and there are now affiliated groups in Australia, Europe, Canada, and Asia.

Group volunteers scan public domain texts using software like OCR (optical character recognition). Using OCR software does result in a certain number of text errors and, as a result, new volunteer e-book quality control efforts have developed.

Distributed Proofreaders (DP or PGDP) volunteers, who proofread drafts of the e-books created by _Project Gutenberg_, is one of those quality control efforts.  DP was founded in 2000 by Charles Franks, and DP e-text contributions currently make up half of the _Project Gutenberg_ digital library. Along with DP similar efforts have evolved in Europe and Canada. 

Distributed Proofreaders Europe, started in 2004, is hosted by Project Rastko, and focuses on European cultural material including non-English texts.  Distributed Proofreaders Canada was launched in 2007 to support Project Gutenberg Canada.  All of these organizations adhere to copyright laws, though the Canadian "life plus 50" copyright law allows works to be preserved as e-books sooner in Canada than in other countries. 

In addition to the projects converting previously printed books into e-books, there are many new works being created as digital material. This trend, along with the efforts to convert existing printed books, means an entire new market with serious implications for indexers.

While the mental process of indexing remains similar regardless of medium, there are some unique problems related to indexing e-books. First of all, the lack of e-book compatibility is a problem. Currently, there are numerous formats used for e-books that are not all compatible with one another (think—PC versus Mac platforms), which means that indexers must take into account these different formats when indexing this material. Also, a set standard for e-book indexes has yet to be developed.  In addition, indexing tools are still in a state of development to accommodate this new indexing niche.  And last of all, the e-book publishing industry will have to be convinced that indexes are a necessity in e-books. These are just some of the challenges related to e-books facing indexers.

Jan Wright, who wrote the embedded Word curriculum and Exercise 5, has given us permission to view a video she created which discusses some of the e-book issues facing indexers.
