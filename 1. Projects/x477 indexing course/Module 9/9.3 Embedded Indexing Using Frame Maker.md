## 9.3 Embedded Indexing Using FrameMaker

![notepad](https://onlinelearning.berkeley.edu/courses/1939224/files/233565849/preview)_From the desk of ... Cynthia F. Berman_  
Cynthia F. Berman is a technical writer, editor, indexer, and content manager. She specializes in embedded indexing of computer and technology content. Her tools of choice for embedded indexing are Adobe FrameMaker and IXgen. Cynthia began indexing computer manuals in the early 1990s. She has indexed computer content delivered as printed manuals, PDF files, and online help. She has also written indexing style guides for clients and taught indexing workshops. In this topic, she goes through her process of writing an embedded index in FrameMaker.

### Creating an Embedded Index

#### Background

Embedding index markers in FrameMaker source files differs from creating a stand-alone index using dedicated indexing software such as MACREX, CINDEX, or SKY. The main differences between embedded and dedicated indexing are:

-   Embedded index tag content is entered directly into the source files. This means that the writer and the indexer have to schedule time for the indexer to work in each individual file (creating the tags) and all the files in the book (compiling and editing the full index). The writer and the indexer cannot work in the same file at the same time.

-   Embedded indexes must be compiled to be viewed.

#### Writing the Index

Because I typically have to share files with the writer, I ask for a PDF file of the entire book (or help topics). That way, I have a draft that I can use to provide context and a somewhat accurate table of contents.

Before I start indexing, I ask the writer to tell me about the reader. I want to have an idea of who the reader is and what he or she is trying to do and why.

Then, I take a little time to familiarize myself with the writer's style and writing model. Often, software companies use writing models such as Information Mapping or other task-based models, which make indexing much easier. Even if the company does not use a task-based model, I create task-based indexes. The reason is that the reader goes to the index to find the information needed to complete a task. Computer manuals are typically not read for pleasure.

Usually, chapters or help topics have repeating elements, such as process overviews, procedures, background concepts, definitions, examples, cross-references, and warnings. These elements often follow a general structure that begins with an introduction (the chapter's metatopic), followed by a use-case, business scenario, or process overview. Next are a series of sections that address individual elements of the process. Each section typically includes one or more procedures and the other repeating elements. If the writer has used a task-based writing model, each type of information will be segregated. If the writer has not used a task-based writing model, the information may be a bit jumbled together, but it should still be there.

Because I am creating a task-based index, each index entry should answer one of the following questions:

-   What does the reader need to do? (processes, procedures)
-   What does the reader need to know in order to do it? (concepts, definitions, warnings, examples)

Now I have my direction. I find all the procedures, and I create index entries for them. Hopefully, the procedures are titled with procedure headings, but sometimes they are not. I mark the explicit procedures as well as those that are implied. Sometimes in tandem, sometimes in a separate pass, I mark the other elements that explain the task. The clearer the writing model, the faster the indexing goes.

As I progress through the book or help topic, I add cross-references as needed. I also keep a list of questions and comments for the writer.

### Editing

As I finish each chapter, I compile and edit the index for that chapter. I only do a light edit at this stage, such as fixing broken page ranges, checking the spelling, and splitting overly long subentry lists. I also compare the index to the table of contents for the chapter to make sure I didn't miss anything. I print my final version of each chapter index and keep it as a reference for subsequent chapters. This is especially important when I do not have access to the entire book.

When I compile the full index, I expand my editing to include the following steps:

1.  Consolidate entries and subentries
2.  Edit wording of entries to make them concise and consistent
3.  Break long subentry lists into shorter lists
4.  Check for parallel construction, such as use of gerunds and nouns, use of singular or plural nouns, and parallel topics and wording
5.  Check spelling again
6.  Verify that cross-references link to the right topics
7.  Verify that topics that should be double-posted are double-posted

Luckily, the IXgen plug-in makes editing in FrameMaker a breeze. The first four items on the list can be done in an IXgen editing table in about one-third the time it takes to do the editing using FrameMaker alone.

The last two things I do before I send the files back to the writer are back up everything again and spell check the index again.
