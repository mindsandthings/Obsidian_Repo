# Linked Data and Music (Kelly 2015)

[I don't understand this article at all. There are no examples given. The author summarizes other articles, but doesn't explain why they're problems or solutions. It introduces many terms without defining them. I don't have any understanding of how any of this could be used, and I don't see an attempt to either put forth ideas or build on them. I also don't see any connection between the material of the article and anyone's work.]

# Visual Indexes (Russell & Dearnley, 2017)

Visual indexes exist.

Lots of small widely varied issues

"The art historian Erwin Panofsky (1955) developed a method to analyse images combining both their objective and interpretive aspects. Panofsky distinguished three levels of subject matter or meaning, which he called pre-iconographical description (objects or events), iconographical analysis (themes), and iconographical interpretation (meaning)."

". Shatford considered that an image may be both ‘of’ something and ‘about’ something. She defined four subject facets: • who (objects and beings) • what (activities, events and emotions) • where (place) • when (time). Each facet has three different aspects: the ‘specific of’, the ‘generic of’ and the ‘about’. The ‘aboutness’ of an image tends to represent a more subjective analysis of the image."

"[In positivism,] Indexers are cautioned against interpretation and directed to index objectively. This prevalent paradigm effectively limits indexers’ conceptualization of the subject and the image content they index to objective subjects. Equally, in the tradition of librarianship there is a clear tendency to specificity and avoiding ambiguity (Svenonius, 2000: 76, 108, 187–8). The positivist"

"The distribution of subject terms by facets is shown in Table 2 and Figure 4. The facet G1, the kind of person or thing, had the greatest number of subjects (82). The specific facets of ‘where?’ (S3) and ‘who?’ (S1) were the next largest, with 43 and 40 respectively. While one indexer mentioned four subjects relating to the abstract ‘what?’ (A2), he indicated he probably would not use them when assigning final subject headings. The ‘who?’ facets (S1, G1) with a total of"


[what is missing here: discussion of the social context in which the images were / will be shared]

[I don't yet have experience with users' purposes for accessing and sharing historical images and how those might change over time, so I think that made it harder for me to focus on level of description]
