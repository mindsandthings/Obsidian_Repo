# Linked Data and Music (Kelly 2015)

[I don't understand this article at all. There are no examples given. The author summarizes other articles, but doesn't explain why they're problems or solutions. It introduces many terms without defining them. I don't have any understanding of how any of this could be used, and I don't see an attempt to either put forth ideas or build on them. I also don't see any connection between the material of the article and anyone's work.]
