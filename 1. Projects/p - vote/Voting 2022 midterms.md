To work out:

Alameda County Prop D - I'm not sure I have opinions, probably yes? 

District Attorney - Terry Wiley vs Pamela Price - Price is the more progressive one

Bart Director - Ames vs Nishihira - I am leaning toward the incumbent

Easy Bay Regional Park District Director, Ward 3 - Dennis Waespi vs Daphne Lin vs Gina M. Lewis - probably Waespi but wait to hear back
