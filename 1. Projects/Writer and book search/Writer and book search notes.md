1. Writer and book search: look for substacks, blogs, etc.

3. Learning new ways to do stuff:
-- try reading through a book and summarizing what happened in each category after each scene or chapter 
-- color-coding different categories that show up so I can see it from a higher level
-- picking out the threads. Give yourself a set of questions for each chapter: what happened with character development, worldbuilding, plot? And if nothing happened you don't have to answer it. 
-- try also same with nonfiction, to look for structures.
