### 1. Check publisher's stylesheet and set up index

-   Alphabetization: letter-by-letter or word-by-word
-   Capitalization: initial letter of common noun capitalized or not
-   Locators: elided or full page range (124-26 or 124-126)
-   Notes: form of notes (126n7)
-   Illustrations, tables, and figures: form of locators
-   Cross-reference format and placement
-   Format of index: run-in style, indented style

Determine page range. 

[Macrex] Set up a folder for the client with defaults stored in that folder. 

### 2. Start indexing

Remember:
* Over-index; it's easier to cut than add
* Write notes about alternate wordings, double-posting decisions, topic relationships, and queries
	* Cindex: enclose in asterisks
* Avoid repeating the text. Point to it instead. 
* Avoid indexing what the reader doesn't already know ("ten usability heuristics")
* Check that phrasing clearly conveys the meaning. 
* Ensure the same info is listed, and accessible to the reader, at multiple access points

Process: 
* [Try] Read the first chapter and skim the remaining ones
* Make a metatopic entry; keep metatopic firmly in mind
* Identify each section's main topic(s), using who/what/where/why/when/under what circumstances; look for ways to break down if necessary for the convenience of the reader (esp using why/when/under what circumstances)
* Go back and find the smaller topics within the section, adding to the main topic and as their own main headings if relevant
* Double-check locators as I go
* Double-check names as I go
* Enter xrefs as I go

Propagate changes (Sky: Ctrl-Alt-Enter, )

If paper: make tick marks, one per index entry, on a word in the text that signifies that entry


Notes:
"mrbfr": "more before this page",  if I've decided to start picking something up and I think there are earlier references to it
"fer": find earlier refs
"xpost"
"reword?"
"dp" (double-post)
In Sky, start with !! so I can group on notes. 




### While You're Indexing

Once you have started, pay attention to structural issues that may develop in your index.

-   Coverage of both general and specific topics
-   Metatopic overload (Are you lumping too much under the overall subject of the book?)
-   Completeness and comprehensiveness of main headings
-   Multiple access points for the same term
-   Cross-references to move users around the index

#### Main Heading Issues

-   Broad main headings with too many subheadings: break them down into more-specific main headings.
-   Closely related main headings: combine main headings into one main heading.
-   Main headings needing distinctions in meaning: use more than one main heading, not one general heading for all.
-   Wording: use nouns, adjectives + nouns, gerunds, or noun phrases.

#### Subheading Issues

-   Subheadings that have too many locators: break out a subheading into a main heading and link it to the original main heading with a cross-reference.
-   Combine or delete subheadings if there are too many subheadings for the number of pages.
-   Wording: make your wording concise, using keyword access.
-   Sub-subheadings: avoid these if possible, but use with biography, medical, and legal materials.

#### Cross-Reference Issues

Cross-references must match the main heading exactly. Add any additional cross-references that are needed. Avoid the following:

-   Blind references
-   Circular cross references
-   Convoluted references leading to another _See_ references rather than directly to a main heading

#### Double-Posting Issues

Double-posting refers to the use of the same term or concept in different positions in the index (as main heading, as subheading, as acronym). These double-postings must be consistent. A thorough double-postings check also provides a way to look at the index in a different way. Use group mode on main headings and other concepts to find all instances of them within the index. Check these types of headings for consistent page numbers:

-   Direct flipping of main headings and subheadings
-   Subheading as a separate main heading
-   Foreign language terms and translations of foreign language terms
-   Acronyms/abbreviations and full form of name
-   Synonyms with few page numbers

#### General Editorial Issues to Keep an Eye On as You Go

While you're indexing, use the spell-check feature, and keep the following problem areas in mind:

-   Consistency in hyphenated words
-   Name-place organization starting with the same word
-   Proper names: check as you go
-   Inappropriate use of boldface or italic font
-   Parentheses and quotation mark sets
-   Spaces in wrong places
-   Consistency in spelling and capitalization
-   Locators that are obviously wrong -- large numbers, individual locators that should be combined in a page range (79, 79-81, 80)

### When You've Completed the Index Structure

When you are ready for the final edit and proofing process, allow some time for editorial distance. Start fresh in the morning or after lunch. You will need to counteract the "glaze-over factor" that comes from being involved with the material for several days or weeks. Separate pass-throughs for editing and proofreading are helpful, so you don't have to look for everything in one pass. Below is a suggested list of issues to concentrate on in separate passes.

-   Undifferentiated page numbers and synonymous main headings
-   Locators that are obviously wrong
-   Main headings with lots of subheadings and wording of subheadings
-   Double-postings of concepts, synonyms, and abbreviations/acronyms
-   Cross-reference accuracy


Don't index back matter for this course
Verify locators for all double-posts [have a way to mark as double posts]
Don't overindex - you don't need a bunch of subheadings all referring to the same page

If you are going to have an entry for West Nile Virus,  then you should provide access points to all the relevant discussion, either through subentries or cross references. One option would be to include broad-strokes subentries that cover the sections of the text. Another option would be to include the subentries here, and then cross references to other main entries (such as “symptoms” and “testing”) that cover the other sections.



### 3. Editing
* Before major editing, make a backup of the file
* Run spellchecker
* Check for orphan locators after a heading that has subheadings
* [Sky] Run "error scan" utility (improperly worded or circular cross references, orphan subheadings, improperly formed entries, and entries with more than five locators)
* Check for thoroughness and consistency in meaning and grammar
* [Sky] Use grouping feature to integrate similar concepts, eliminate redundancies, and add or subtract terms
* Check locator accuracy when reviewing terms
* Address flagged entries
* Possibly search for important terms to ensure thoroughness
* [Sky] Run error checking again
* Edit RTF:
	* Any required templates or formatting
	* Check for double periods, commas preceded by spaces, double parentheses
	* Run Word spell check
* Read through one final time

When I'm being thorough, I like to do what Do Mi explains in her book on 'cross checking'. Group on every entry with subheadings to make sure it's consistently double posted. That takes me a VERY long time (hours).

Validate cross-references
Verify locator formation
check subheading wording for collocation, differentiation, information scent and clarity; should review subheadings for parallel construction; and ensure that all subheadings reveal a clear relationship to the heading. 
 

use a special marker, produced with a keyword, to identify double-posted entries that have been cross-checked

-   Look back through the text for missed topics, using a "checkback" list kept during the entering process

-   Delete unnecessary subheadings

-   Create subheadings for entries with too many locators

-   Consolidate subheadings within entries

-   Use group mode to view and check double-posted entries

-   Check the alphabetical order for strange entries in which I may need to force the sort

-   Research queries

-   Address any concerns I had during editing, recorded in notes in the index or my word processor setup file (On more complex books, this may involve deconstructing and rebuilding large entries.)

-   Examine each line for errors

-   Group on initialisms (for example, on acronyms) by searching for two capital letters together using a macro, and check that they are either double-posted or cross-referenced

-   Have MACREX check cross-reference accuracy

-   Search my note marker to be sure I have addressed and deleted all notes
