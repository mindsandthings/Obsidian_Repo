2) Help me find another biofeedback device to test out. I'd like you to look into the different stress and brain wearables on the market and make a table with the following info about each one:  

## Is it available for consumers to purchase? (check this first; if not you can skip that device)

## What mental or physical state(s) does the feedback direct you towards? In particular, differentiating between relaxation and focus. 
  
## Do they have an app ecosystem? Can their app do more than one thing?  

## What is their return policy?

## What does the device actually sense? (if they don't make it obvious, don't go digging, just report that it's not obvious)  
  
## Without delving into the science, what feeling do you get from the site? Substantive or scammy?  

  
## Has anyone posted/published any interesting blog posts about it?   
  

## Would you be interested in trying it?  


#   [HeartMath emWave](https://store.heartmath.com/emwavepro/?network=g)


## Is it available for consumers to purchase? (check this first; if not you can skip that device)

Yes

## What mental or physical state(s) does the feedback direct you towards? In particular, differentiating between relaxation and focus. 

* Coherence and alignment("an optimal state in which the heart, mind and emotions are operating in-sync and balanced"). They use the phrase "high performance state."
* They also mention: reduce stress, improve sleep, restore energy, balance emotions, increase focus, tap into your intuition. 

## Do they have an app ecosystem? Can their app do more than one thing?  

- It's difficult to tell, but I don't think so. It measures pulse and HRV, and has some games. 
- I could not find other apps. 

## What is their return policy?

- "If you are not completely satisfied, you may return your product within 60 days for a full refund, less the shipping and handling fees. Does not apply to training programs, on-line programs, maintenance fees or any subscription services. Returned products must be in original packaging, including all original parts."
- It also has a 1-year return policy for manufacturer defect. 

## What does the device actually sense? (if they don't make it obvious, don't go digging, just report that it's not obvious)  

HRV and pulse. 
  
## Without delving into the science, what feeling do you get from the site? Substantive or scammy?

## Is it available for consumers to purchase? (check this first; if not you can skip that device)

- For rent. Notable: their subscription plans involve remote monitoring and are eligible for FSA reimbursement, according to their website. Apparently some folks' insurance also covers it (see eligibility assessment: https://www.getlief.com/assistant_page). However, you can purchase it as a consumer regardless. 
- Looks like rental is $49/month and coaching is $50/month, plus $8.95 shipping. Their website references other coaching plans, as well as the ability to not use a coaching plan, but it's unclear how to order that from the website. 

## What mental or physical state(s) does the feedback direct you towards? In particular, differentiating between relaxation and focus. 

- "overcome stress and worry"

## Do they have an app ecosystem? Can their app do more than one thing?  

- "Under Menu > Train, you can access different uses for your Lief device, such as listening to your heart beat (Heart Beat mode), and engaging in slow, deep, diaphragmatic breathing (Paced Breathing mode). Some users like to access those modes to help center them during meditation, to help them fall asleep, etc. However, the core exercise specifically designed to increase your HRV, and the main objective of the Lief program, is the Downtime Dose. By syncing your heart rate with your breath, Lief's Downtime Dose sends a biofeedback signal to your brain that you are safe and can relax, thus restoring your nervous system by activating the parasympathetic mode."
- Could not find other apps. 

## What is their return policy?

- No return policy. It's a rental; when you want to cancel your subscription, you send the device back. 
- 1-year warranty where they'll replace the device if there's an issue with the device. 

## What does the device actually sense? (if they don't make it obvious, don't go digging, just report that it's not obvious)  

- HRV
- "Lief initiates vibration feedback when your body dips below your target HRV range, similar to how a continuous glucose monitor device alerts a diabetic to low blood sugar. When you’re in this low HRV state, Lief automatically begins an HRV biofeedback dose (a.k.a. a Downtime). As you breathe with Lief’s vibrations, your Lief monitors your HRV biomarker rise, then automatically ends the autodose when your HRV is back above the target range. As a result of this simple, continuous feedback loop, your body spends less and less time in the low HRV zone, and your average HRV increases over time, enabling your nervous system to respond more calmly in all situations."

Substantive
  
## Has anyone posted/published any interesting blog posts about it?   

I could not find any. 

## Would you be interested in trying it?  

Sure, although I'm not sure whether we can hook up more than one account to it.

# [Muse 2 (different from Muse S Gen 2)](https://choosemuse.com/muse-2/)
## Is it available for consumers to purchase? (check this first; if not you can skip that device)

Yes
## What mental or physical state(s) does the feedback direct you towards? In particular, differentiating between relaxation and focus. 

Mind: Real-time brainwave feedback (EEG) teaches you the art of focus.
Heart: Tune into your heart rate to optimize performance.
Body: Discover how your meditation posture can bring you physical relaxation.
Breath: Learn how to use your breath to find calm and fight stress.

Also, sleep tracking. 

## Do they have an app ecosystem? Can their app do more than one thing?  

After each session, you’ll see how you did through a series of graphs and charts in the Muse meditation app.  Muse will show you how your brain, heart, breath, and body did from moment to moment through simple, easy to understand graphs and charts.

Some stuff on github:

## What is their return policy?

If you purchase it from their website (not a third party vendor like Amazon), you can return it if you use it for no more than 20 days from delivery and they get it within 30 days of delivery. 

## What does the device actually sense? (if they don't make it obvious, don't go digging, just report that it's not obvious)  

  Muse’s 7 finely calibrated EEG brain sensors – 2 on the forehead, 2 behind the ears plus 3 reference sensors – detect and measure the activity of your brain.
Muse 2 has added PPG and pulse oximetry breath and heart sensors that are located on the front, righthand side of the forehead. Gyroscope and accelerometer body sensors are found behind the ears.

# [FocusCalm](https://focuscalm.com/)

## Is it available for consumers to purchase? (check this first; if not you can skip that device)

Yes

## What mental or physical state(s) does the feedback direct you towards? In particular, differentiating between relaxation and focus. 

Calming and stress reduction

## Do they have an app ecosystem? Can their app do more than one thing?  

it combines guided meditation with neurofeedback games and executive function (memory, sustained attention, pattern recognition, decision making, etc.) training. FocusCalm combines these exercises to first teach a user to relax, then strengthen their ability to get into that relaxed state, and finally challenge their ability to use that calm state during active tasks.

## What is their return policy?

FocusCalm has a 30 day money back guarantee for the headband. If you purchased a lifetime subscription, this will be refunded along with the price of the headband. 
[you initiate the app refund through google or apple though]

## What does the device actually sense? (if they don't make it obvious, don't go digging, just report that it's not obvious)  

EEG. Does not do heart rate or motion/sleep tracking. 

## Without delving into the science, what feeling do you get from the site? Substantive or scammy?  

Substantive, maybe more so than others given that they seem to be aware they have competitors.

However: they say they have research under review and have published white papers, but they don't link to any of it, which makes me skeptical. 

## Has anyone posted/published any interesting blog posts about it?   

I could not find any. 

## Would you be interested in trying it?  

Potentially! They want a separately purchased account for each user (on top of the band purchase), although they have monthly options available as well as yearly and lifetime. 

    
#   [BrainLink Pro](https://neurosky.com/)

Their website isn't loading properly, their Amazon link is dead, and their blog hasn't been updated in a couple years. I suspect they are defunct, but I can still look into them if you would like. 



# Additional

The report should include the following devices, plus any others you can find with a quick search.
Things you should skip:  

-   Electrical brain stimulation devices because I'm still too scared to try those, but if you happen on any that use sound or light stimulation I'd be interested in that too
-   Anything with the word "Arduino" on the site anywhere (unless totally optional)
