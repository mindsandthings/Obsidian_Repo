For my weekly time request, I'd like to ask you to work on two things. You can do them anytime you want and if the take more than 2 hours, continue them next week or count them toward a future week's time. There's no rush.  

  

1) Please check whether I can safely iron the creases out of the purple curtain I have hanging from my closet shelf, facing my computer. If desired you can answer this by experimenting on the blue or the green curtain, which are folded up on top of it. They are expendable.  

  

2) Help me find another biofeedback device to test out. I'd like you to look into the different stress and brain wearables on the market and make a table with the following info about each one:  

-   Is it available for consumers to purchase? (check this first; if not you can skip that device)
-   What mental or physical state(s) does the feedback direct you towards? In particular, differentiating between relaxation and focus.Â 
-   Do they have an app ecosystem? Can their app do more than one thing?  
    
-   What is their return policy?
-   What does the device actually sense? (if they don't make it obvious, don't go digging, just report that it's not obvious)  
    
-   Without delving into the science, what feeling do you get from the site? Substantive or scammy?  
    
-   Has anyone posted/published any interesting blog posts about it?  
    
-   Would you be interested in trying it?  
    

The report should include the following devices, plus any others you can find with a quick search.

-   [HeartMath emWave](https://store.heartmath.com/emwavepro/?network=g)
-   [Mendi](https://www.mendi.io/)
-   [Leif](https://getlief.com/)
-   Muse 2 (different from Muse S Gen 2)
-   FocusCalm
-   [BrainLink Pro](https://neurosky.com/)

Things you should skip:  

-   Electrical brain stimulation devices because I'm still too scared to try those, but if you happen on any that use sound or light stimulation I'd be interested in that too
-   Anything with the word "Arduino" on the site anywhere (unless totally optional)
