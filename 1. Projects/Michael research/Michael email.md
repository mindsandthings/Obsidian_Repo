2) Help me find another biofeedback device to test out. I'd like you to look into the different stress and brain wearables on the market and make a table with the following info about each one:  

-   Is it available for consumers to purchase? (check this first; if not you can skip that device)
-   What mental or physical state(s) does the feedback direct you towards? In particular, differentiating between relaxation and focus. 
-   Do they have an app ecosystem? Can their app do more than one thing?  
-   What is their return policy?
-   What does the device actually sense? (if they don't make it obvious, don't go digging, just report that it's not obvious)  
-   Without delving into the science, what feeling do you get from the site? Substantive or scammy?  
-   Has anyone posted/published any interesting blog posts about it?   
-   Would you be interested in trying it?  
    


##   [HeartMath emWave](https://store.heartmath.com/emwavepro/?network=g)

-   Available for consumer purchase? Yes
-   What mental or physical state(s) does the feedback direct you towards? In particular, differentiating between relaxation and focus.
	- Coherence and alignment("an optimal state in which the heart, mind and emotions are operating in-sync and balanced"). They use the phrase "high performance state." 
	- They also mention: reduce stress, improve sleep, restore energy, balance emotions, increase focus, tap into your intuition. 
-   Do they have an app ecosystem? Can their app do more than one thing?  
	- It's difficult to tell, but I don't think so. It measures pulse and HRV, and has some games. 
	- I could not find other apps. 
-   What is their return policy?
	- "If you are not completely satisfied, you may return your product within 60 days for a full refund, less the shipping and handling fees. Does not apply to training programs, on-line programs, maintenance fees or any subscription services. Returned products must be in original packaging, including all original parts."
	- It also has a 1-year return policy for manufacturer defect. 
-   What does the device actually sense? (if they don't make it obvious, don't go digging, just report that it's not obvious)  
	- HRV and pulse. 
-   Without delving into the science, what feeling do you get from the site? Substantive or scammy?
	- Substantive. 
-   Has anyone posted/published any interesting blog posts about it?   
	- https://mentalhealthdaily.com/2015/03/17/emwave2-review-the-best-biofeedback-tool-for-anxiety-stress-performance/

-   Would you be interested in trying it?  
	- If you get it, I'll try it!

##   [Mendi](https://www.mendi.io/)

-   Is it available for consumers to purchase? (check this first; if not you can skip that device)
-   What mental or physical state(s) does the feedback direct you towards? In particular, differentiating between relaxation and focus. 
	- "train your brain to enhance its functioning, for instance, improve focus, control mood, regulate stress level and create better sleep patterns"
-   Do they have an app ecosystem? Can their app do more than one thing?  
	- "provides you with live, visual feedback based on your brain activity measured by the Mendi headset while you play a brain training mobile game."
	- no other apps
-   What is their return policy?
	- "Try Mendi for 30 days with 100% money-back guarantee"
-   What does the device actually sense? (if they don't make it obvious, don't go digging, just report that it's not obvious)  
	- "uses advanced functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure blood flow and oxygenation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)."
-   Without delving into the science, what feeling do you get from the site? Substantive or scammy?  
-   Has anyone posted/published any interesting blog posts about it?
	- Good thorough review of a pre-release version: https://the-gadgeteer.com/2020/04/15/mendi-brain-training-device-review
-   Would you be interested in trying it?  
	- Sure
	

##   [Leif](https://getlief.com/)


-   Is it available for consumers to purchase? (check this first; if not you can skip that device)
	- For rent. Notable: their subscription plans involve remote monitoring and is eligible for FSA reimbursement, according to their website. Apparently some folks' insurance also covers it (see eligibility assessment: https://www.getlief.com/assistant_page). However, you can purchase it as a consumer regardless. 
	- Looks like rental is $49/month and coaching is $50/month, plus $8.95 shipping. 
-   What mental or physical state(s) does the feedback direct you towards? In particular, differentiating between relaxation and focus. 
	- "overcome stress and worry"
-   Do they have an app ecosystem? Can their app do more than one thing?  
	- "Under Menu > Train, you can access different uses for your Lief device, such as listening to your heart beat (Heart Beat mode), and engaging in slow, deep, diaphragmatic breathing (Paced Breathing mode). Some users like to access those modes to help center them during meditation, to help them fall asleep, etc. However, the core exercise specifically designed to increase your HRV, and the main objective of the Lief program, is the Downtime Dose. By syncing your heart rate with your breath, Lief's Downtime Dose sends a biofeedback signal to your brain that you are safe and can relax, thus restoring your nervous system by activating the parasympathetic mode."
	- Could not find other apps. 
-   What is their return policy?
	- No return policy. It's a rental; when you want to cancel your subscription, you send the device back. 
	- 1-year warranty where they'll replace the device if there's an issue with the device. 
-   What does the device actually sense? (if they don't make it obvious, don't go digging, just report that it's not obvious)  
	- HRV
	- "Lief initiates vibration feedback when your body dips below your target HRV range, similar to how a continuous glucose monitor device alerts a diabetic to low blood sugar. When you’re in this low HRV state, Lief automatically begins an HRV biofeedback dose (a.k.a. a Downtime). As you breathe with Lief’s vibrations, your Lief monitors your HRV biomarker rise, then automatically ends the autodose when your HRV is back above the target range. As a result of this simple, continuous feedback loop, your body spends less and less time in the low HRV zone, and your average HRV increases over time, enabling your nervous system to respond more calmly in all situations."
-   Without delving into the science, what feeling do you get from the site? Substantive or scammy?  
	- Substantive
-   Has anyone posted/published any interesting blog posts about it? 
	- I could not find any. 
-   Would you be interested in trying it?  
	- sure, although I'm not sure whether we can hook up more than one account to it

    ## Additional
    The report should include the following devices, plus any others you can find with a quick search.
Things you should skip:  

-   Electrical brain stimulation devices because I'm still too scared to try those, but if you happen on any that use sound or light stimulation I'd be interested in that too
-   Anything with the word "Arduino" on the site anywhere (unless totally optional)
-
