High-nitrogen slow-release fertilizer

Potting soil may be used for growing bamboo. However, a mixture of peat moss and perlite with potting soil (⅓ each) is the best practice.


Diluted liquid houseplant fertilizer (I like this organic plant food), aquarium water, and other forms of fertilizer and nutrients for houseplants may also be suitable.

A dose of slow-release fertilizer at the beginning of the growing season is a good way to provide a steady supply. You can use a balanced fertilizer such as 16-16-16, or a high nitrogen (N) fertilizer such as 30-10-10. The high nitrogen option discourages flowering, which weakens many bamboo species

Avoid seaweed-based fertilizes

When you pull a root bound bamboo out of its container, the roots will basically retain the shape of the pot. Begin by sawing off the bottom inch or so of the root ball, where the roots are turning back on themselves. You may need to do the same around the sides, or you can simply cut through the ball and break it into 3 or 4 chunks.

It’s a messy process, but the ends will justify the means. When you’re finished you’ll have more bamboo plants than when you started, and they’ll be happier. They might take a couple months to bounce back, but then you’ll have a flourishing garden, maybe even a few extra bamboo plants for your friends.
