if we put stuff in the backyard, have to keep Karl out of it
herbs - keep in containers so I can move inside? 

do we want space in back yard?

# Wood 
The classic material to build your beds is wood. You can use boards, 4×4s, railroad ties—anything you can get your hands on. If you can buy cedar, your beds will last much longer, as cedar rots very slowly compared to other woods. If you’re using boards from a hardware store, try using L-shaped brackets to attach the boards together. They’re much stronger and more stable than nailing boards together. Better yet, use posts driven into the ground and attach your boards to the posts. The options here really are endless, as long as you make sure you construct something sturdy.


WHAT TYPE OF WOOD IS SAFE FOR GARDENING? There’s a lot of debate about the right type of wood to use in the garden. The two best types of wood are untreated cedar and redwood, but both of these can be hard to find and pricey. Your next best bets are hemlock, fir, or pine, but they don’t last as long. Still, they’re more accessible and cheaper, meaning replacing them will cost you less over the years.

NO pressure-treated or CCA-treated wood. 

Concrete blocks are stable and cheap.

Bricks are great but are brittle and can break/chip

Most metal raised beds are sold as raised bed garden kits. There’s nothing wrong with grabbing a kit if you don’t have the materials or the desire to build your own. They’re often lightweight and gorgeous, adding some real sparkle to the garden. The only things to consider with a metal bed is if they’ve been coated properly to avoid leaching, and if they are painted a lighter color on the outside to avoid heat retention.

Corrugated, Aluzinc-coated metal beds from Birdie’s Garden Products is my go-to raised bed these days. 

# Constructing the Bed 
A good rule of thumb on sizing raised beds is to build beds no wider than 4 feet on any side. This is because your arm only has about a 2-foot reach, so a 4-foot bed is easily accessible from any side at any time. If you’re setting up more than one raised bed, be careful to leave enough room between beds. The last thing you want to do is squeeze them so closely together that you can’t work in between beds. I recommend 20 to 24 inches between beds as a minimum. This allows you to get in there and prune, harvest, or water without any issues.

Lining the bottom of your beds with landscape fabric prevents all but the most ambitious weeds from growing. Lining Your Beds You have a few options for lining the bottom of your beds. The method you choose depends on the problem that you most anticipate having. If your space is prone to gnarly weeds, then laying down a heavy landscape fabric will suffocate them while still allowing enough air and water through without affecting the drainage of your bed. If you’d rather not use any plastic, laying down old newspaper and topping off with old cardboard will do a good job too. However, after enough time, cardboard will rot and weeds may start penetrating your bed. If you struggle more with burrowing pests than weeds, consider hardware cloth instead. It’s deceptively named, as it’s actually a heavy-duty wire mesh and not a fabric. As you might imagine, it’s impossible for larger pests to burrow through this mesh, but weeds have an easy time penetrating the large holes. The ultimate solution is to line the bottom with both, but this usually isn’t necessary. It’s just the safest option if you want no problems at all in your bed.
