Photos in Royal Ann folder in Google Drive (my folder not Allie's).

Front lawn front strip (October): in sun from before 9am-1pm (didn't start photos earlier but I'd expect it to be in sun as soon as the sun clears the houses across the street). Half-in-shadow on the driveway side at 2pm; at 5, fully dark. 
Front lawn side strip (street side half, past bend, October): in sun from before 9am to 2pm; mostly in shadow by 4pm. 

Back yard back strip, October: 
-- 9am: right three panels in sun; in shadow at 12pm though grassy area in sun. 
-- 10am: right four panels in sun; in shadow at 12pm though grassy area in sun.

The sunniest area is the where the bricks and grass meet next to the grill. 


Back yard back strip, September:
-- 9am: right 5 panels in sun; shade has started encroaching from fence at 12 and covered by 1:30. Main grassy area still in sun at 3 but shadowed by 4. 

The sunniest area is just house-side of the meter thing.
