# Aug 2022 areas of focus

Take at least one new class each year; do time-limited classes so it's easier to leave (unless it's a group of people).

Keep track of your learning progress and celebrate the progression from one level to the next.

Make sure my decisions about what to learn and what to invest in and take into account implementation barriers for later work.

Watch nonfiction about what you're writing about. Or even a random nonfiction unrelated book.

For a learner, it's all related because everythign is a learning process.

A lot of learners like to be on the cutting edge, on the frontier of something.

Often, learners feel doign more research is an indulgence we can't afford - but it's essential.

If you don't know what you should write yet, learning isn't procrastinationâ€”it's essential.

Being able to assimilate quickly (including others' mindsets) is a key attribute of Learner. Asset: that feeling of reality you get when doign research.

If you're a high learner, it can be valuable to learn about different genres.

Learning generates energy for you.

I am trying to expand my knowledge with the ASI indexing course. But...I need to make sure not to drop learning while doing market research. I'll read the Mulvany book. I think learning more about writing would be helpful too, except I have no idea what to read.

I'm feeling overwhelmed by options and unfocused, without a clear path forward or momentum.
