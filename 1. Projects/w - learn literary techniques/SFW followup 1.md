Resources for learning more about patterns:
- Emotional wound thesauri and all the other ones (Angela Ackerman and Becca Pugilisi). 
- Ackerman and Pugilisi's website, [onestopforwriters.com](http://onestopforwriters.com)
- [plotsforauthors.com](http://plotsforauthors.com). Has breakdowns of different tropes (not a cheap resource and probably just 1 or 2 that will be helpful). She has a couple that have like 10 tropes or something - look at the samples of those rather than buying one.
- Jen Barnes' talk [Writing For Your Id](https://www.rwa.org/Online/Online/Store/StoreLayouts/Item_Detail.aspx?iProductCode=AUDIO18WTYI&Category=RECORDINGS) 
- Jen Barnes has another talk, about fandoms (couldn't find the talk, but here's her [article about it](https://crimereads.com/the-psychology-of-fandom/), and here's [her TedX talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22yoaiLYb7M)
- [Secrets of Story by Matt Bird](https://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Story-Innovative-Perfecting-Captivating-ebook/dp/B01N7HV0CT)

When editing: 
- (Advice from Susan) Look for things like when you see somebody doing what you want to do, dig into how they did it, or why it struck me. See what they did in one scene that struck me and analyze it in the context of the book - what went into making it happen. 
- (My thoughts) Come up with some examples of effects that I want to create. For example, Tamsyn Muir producing an effect by focusing on putting on the dog's booties instead of the eldritch horror, but still managing to make it interesting.
