-   Takeaways
    

-   Muir is very good at writing fresh and coming up with unusual but still-effective turns of phrase. I envy her that, and it strikes me as something that’s very difficult to get good at. It’s partly vocabulary (she used two words in here that I hadn’t encountered before—placket and thuddering) but I suspect it’s also partly just that when she reaches for a word to represent a concept, she has a broader reach than I do, or is better at not getting stuck on the first appropriate word that comes to mind. I guess I could try to consciously generate more synonyms before settling on a word, and see if that helps. 
    
-   Extensive, tight braiding. The parts of her work that stand out in my memory are the big long yellow passages, but those don’t make up the bulk of the work. 

-   Lots and lots of power words and backloading
    
-   Lots and lots of mood-themed and character-themed word choices. 
    
-   I find it very easy to use anaphora, anadiplosis, epistrophe, etc, and was surprised she used those so little. 
    
-   I should probably try to get better at assonance
    
-   The multiple-sources-of-tension thing is something I could try to get better at.
