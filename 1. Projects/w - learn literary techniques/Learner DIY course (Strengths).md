Anyone who's high Learner (and by high, I mean probably anywhere in your top half of Strengths), think about this for a second.

I said something out loud to a group of Learners the other day and it kinda made me have an epiphany. We were discussing how we want to reach competency in a particular arena, and how it's so much easier to do that (reach competency) when you know which skills you need and when someone has curated a journey for you.

So many of us who are Learners naturally create a sort of rubric for ourselves about what we need to learn in order to reach competency (especially if you're Learner/Developer and also have a teaching background or any training in pedagogy). So we have a sense for how skill progression happens and we naturally think about reaching competency.

But think about the process of "becoming an author" or "being a good writer" or "running a good business."

When do I know I've reached competence in those tasks? How do I know I know enough? How do I guide or curate my own journey?

Many of us don't. We take every class that comes along because we like learning, but we don't have as refined a sense of whether or not the class is progressing us in a direction. We aren't as clear on whether I know enough about, let's say, advertising. Or newsletters. Or marketing. Let alone the actual journey to author competence.

Add in the complication that, because there is so much to learn, we often focus more heavily on taking classes than on praxis (especially if the classes themselves don't push us toward taking action on the information, or we're taking so many, we're not able to act on any of the information.

I want to propose an alternative, just as an experiment.

What if you devised a program for yourself? A syllabus? (Or you worked with a collective group of people to help find one.) Like, "I'm going to make this the year of newsletters" or "I'm going to do a year of mastering this ad system" or "this will be my craft year" or "I'm going to throw everything I can into going wide."

Something with an end goal.

Here are the steps I would go through to get to that place. (And yes, you can do this process even if you're not a Learner, but since this came up in the Learner discussion, I felt like Learners especially would benefit from this.)

1. Decide what you'd like to do. (Is the goal to "learn everything I can"? Or is the goal to "see an increase in growth" or is the goal to "double my newsletter size"? Or whatever your primary goal is.)

2. Commit to a deep dive focus on that thing in a way that will keep you from taking on other classes or tangents. (This might include making a commitment to another person or it might mean unfollowing some sources of constant input that are always distracting you from your goal.)

3. Think of all the potential skills you might need to develop in order to meet this goal (and you can ask a coach or a friend to help with this as well). Think outside the author box. Don't just go looking for people who are teaching this to authors, but look outside the community.

4. Ask a friend or friend group or high Input person (or group of high Input people) to give you as many ideas as possible about what you could do to, for instance, get better at newsletters.

5. Think not only of the theoretical (or not only of the practical). Make sure your intentions include skills that could be helpful in addition to information specifically about this focus.

6. Collect everything together, look at the dates of class offerings (reach out if you have to ask for future dates of classes from teachers who are reachable), and start to put things in order based on when they're being offered and when you have available time.

7. Devise a test of the information (homework) each time you learn a new skill. Make sure there's not only time to put the information into practice, but also to evaluate your progress and potentially ask for help if you need it.

8. Before you begin, assess yourself (I always use a 1 to 10 scale) in each of the skill areas that you're looking to improve on. Put that information in a binder or a notebook or folder where you'll always be able to refer to it.

9. Evaluate at intervals how you've been progressing and ask if there's anything that needs to change.

(Set up coaching with Elli or Nikki or Becca if you want help devising the schedule. Or Krystal, who is our marketing expert if your area of focus is marketing. This would also be a great way to use your microcoaching session if you're struggling to come up with something to discuss this month. It would also be a good thing to check in with, over the course of the year, in either coaching or microcoaching.)

Let's do one as an example.

I want to learn about newsletters. This is going to be the year I double-down on newsletters. I commit to setting up a syllabus and following it, with regular tests for praxis and evaluation, to get better at this, to the best of my ability.

Potential skills: mailing list maintenance, automation and follow-up sequences, content generation, reader journeys, copywriting, hooks, lead generation, graphics, selling, mindset.

Do I have any blocks to skill development that I need to address first? Do I maybe need to include therapy or mindset coaching alongside my development? (Becca horning in here: All the correct theory in the world can't overcome a limiting mindset or a trauma response.) This is an area I think a lot of us need to address, by the way. Some of us are afraid of selling because it will bring attention to us and attention is dangerous. (Therapy territory.) Some of us are afraid of selling because we've been taught we're only allowed to ask for what we want if we know the answer is yes. Therapy will help with that. Some of us need realignment about taking on debt or making good investments of our money. It's potentially worth doing a session with me if you think you're in this arena.

If my blocks are relatively safe (I mean, we all have issues, but... can I progress safely? Then let's go.)...

Now it's time to ask everyone I know where they get their information about newsletters. And I want an exhaustive list here because I might not choose all of them. Obviously, there are some that we will naturally gravitate toward because we know a lot of people who have loved them (and there's a possibility that we've already taken the course in the past, so I might include "revisit my favorite newsletter classes of days yore" on the list). I would also consider going super wide in addition to deep, here. I would look on Clubhouse for (reputable--make sure of course that they're not scammers) recommendations outside of the author industry, or look at Teachable or one of the other course platforms for people who are teaching classes outside the author sphere. (Again, due diligence is important before spending money. Quickly QTP anyone promising results that seem too good to be true. They probably are.)

Ok, I've got the list of absolutely every newsletter class or book that I can find. Now comes the curation part. (Some of us may have already been curating along the way, but if we haven't yet, this is the time to curate.) Anything that seems like it might be repetitive information to something I already have on the list or have already taken, I probably want to cut those because I want to make sure I always make time for the praxis and evaluation.

Now I want to look at the other skills. Do I have a class that will specifically teach me about something like automation? Do I need to go to a reputable coach to get more intentional development there? I might have periods where I take classes, and then periods where I read books and periods where I get coaching. But I want to make sure to build in time to execute and evaluate when I'm doing the "what am I going to take and when."

I might go to specific teachers and find out when they're teaching their next class, and then build the rest of my syllabus around those classes. Or I might go in order of importance through the skills I think I need to acquire (or the skills an expert has told me I need to acquire). However I set my time up, I want to make sure to make time for the execution and evaluation. (And I may need to meet with friends or with my mastermind group or with a coach or another writer when I do the evaluation.)

Now comes the pre-learning evaluation. I want to pull out all those skills I was planning to learn about and assess my current state in each of those skills. Use whatever scale works best for you but because I like school so much, I often use a grading scale. With pluses and minuses. Some people use a 1 to 10 ladder, which I'm also a fan of, but make sure you delineate what each number means so you can come back at the end of the time period and give yourself the same evaluative edge you did before.

(Also, be prepared, through the process, to realize you don't know as much as you thought you did at the beginning, and to potentially re-evaluate where you really were when you started. Also valid. That's in line with the competencies scale I talked about in the intuitive book.)

Then, of course, comes the practice. The execution, the evaluation, the learning. And at the end, I want to evaluate myself against my beginning scores and see how I did. I also want to make sure to put down any necessary metrics. (How many people are on my newsletter, where are the places they're coming in, how are they converting, etc.)

As often as possible, throughout the time I'm committing (let's say a whole year, in this case), I want to take opportunities only related to getting better at newsletters. I remember a seven-figure author saying to me once that with the sheer number of people on her newsletter, a 40% conversion would be worth six figures of income over a 20% conversion. So it was in her best interest to try getting that newsletter conversion / open-rate higher, because the volume was so high. Maybe that's not where I am, but I want us to think not just about broad skills acquisition, but also about what those skills can mean to the platform. If I got significantly better at one thing for the next six months, would it be better than trying to get a little better at ten things?

I think so. Again. I'm a fan of small progress in the most impactful direction.

What would make the biggest difference to your platform? Newsletter? Ads? Craft? Something else? Maybe you need some microcoaching or coaching around this. I get that. But I do think it's worth asking the question.

If you think about all the potential areas you could do learning in this industry right now, you'll get overwhelmed, because it is overwhelming. Some of you may need to take a break from Strengths for awhile because your mindset work has been significant enough, it's time to focus elsewhere. (Plus, we have a lot of people who stay at the $10 or $25 level of the Patreon so they can get the content, topical calls, and/or microcoaching, but then focus on learning in other areas. I think this is perfect.)

And, of course, if you are interested in doing more intentional development on your Strengths in the upcoming months, we're going to start opening the intensives again here in about a week, so watch for that. So some of us are in a place in our Strengths development journey that we need to intentionally double down on the mindset places that are holding us back or keeping us in a place of fear. We're here to help with that.

But some of us are itching to see forward competence motion in one specific area, and this is just my reminder to double-down on it. If you're a Learner or a Developer, get deep into that Strength and focus on the competence journey. Here's the [link to the Secret Menu page](http://betterfasteracademy.com/secretmenu) so you can register for the new intensives when they come out. (We will also announce them here.)

As always, ask questions if you have them, or tell me what you're thinking. My brain is going to be percolating on this for awhile so I imagine this won't be the last time we talk about it.
