2. Update Maria
3. After I know from Judy what to do about the acrhives, email Jim about the list: 

https://lists.pnwasi.org/mailman/private/indexing-pnw_lists.pnwasi.org/

This is the link to login to the list as an administrator:  [https://lists.pnwasi.org/mailman/admin/indexing-pnw_lists.pnwasi.org](https://lists.pnwasi.org/mailman/admin/indexing-pnw_lists.pnwasi.org)
The List Administrator Password is:  PnwAdm219

1.  Timeframe: early January
    
2.  Set up the Google Group and learn to use it. I went ahead and grabbed [indexing-pnw@googlegroups.com](mailto:indexing-pnw@googlegroups.com), although we can easily change the group name or the group email address if desired. I'll walk through the steps for common tasks and once I'm feeling confident we can set up a Zoom call and I can train you. 
	1. Set up krakenreaders as a "fake" test group, with the same settings as the regular group
	2. Set up the regular group with everything but the description
	3. Make a note to add the description
	4. Figure out how to handle when people sign up but don't put their name—
3. Draft an automatic welcome message. 
4. Plan replacement page for mailman. Contact Jim to replace it? 
5. 
6.  Update everyone:

1.  Coordinate with Maria so she has updated info to include in new member emails.
2.  Update the website's "Contact Us" and "Join the PNW listserv" pages (I can do this when we're ready, or Sam can).
3.  Send an email to the current list telling folks that the list is migrating and that they'll receive an email notifying them they've been added (maybe I can draft this and you can edit it, or vice versa?)  
    

1.  Transfer the list. This will involve cutting-and-pasting names and email addresses from the current list into a text file and reformatting them so that when I paste them into Google Groups' direct add box, it adds them correctly. I can do the cutting/pasting/reformatting. If you have time, it would be great if you could look it over when I'm done and doublecheck that I pasted the right name in next to each email address.  
2. archive any new 2022 emails after Nov 20 to existing google doc; share with Judy, Sam, and Wanda (read-only)
    
3.  Do something to the old mailing list so people can't send to it anymore (and ideally get a bounce message saying "hey, use the other list").  
	1. find out waht this is
	2. figure out what to do about archives
	3. Edit the old signup page: I poked around in the admin interface and we can actually edit that page directly to remove the signup option and add a link to the Google Group (under "Edit the public HTML pages and text files" -> "General list information page").
	    


# Her reply

As I said, I thought I talked with Maria in the past about people who need to be removed, but I never got that information on a regular basis and, to be honest, I forgot about it.  My mind goes to the list when someone requests to join whereas Maria’s perspective is focused on new ASI members and removing people who are no longer members.  After we get the listserv set up with current list members, we don’t need to worry about adding people because they request to be added themselves after Maria sends them the info about it and we just approve the request.  But perhaps whoever is managing the listserv just needs to email Maria at the beginning of each month to ask if anyone needs to be removed or whenever she tends to update her list.  Or maybe once every six months would be OK because Maria’s list is a moving target and some people don’t renew on time, but then renew later. 

Whew,, all these lists are making my head spin.  Maybe we should call them:  Sam’s list, the listserv list, and Maria’s membership list.

We might need to call the guy who set up the listserv to let him know we are migrating it and to see whether its possible to keep the initial page that could have information about the migration to Google Groups.  I know how to add text to the sign up page because I had to add some to make sure that people understood that they needed to be ASI members to join.  However, people continued to request to join even though they weren’t members.  We can ask his advice. 


Were you at the Board meeting?  Judy knows that you will be helping with the listserv, but I’m not sure I mentioned to her that we were thinking about migrating it.  Do you know if that was part of the conversation at the Board meeting?  I will recheck the minutes.
