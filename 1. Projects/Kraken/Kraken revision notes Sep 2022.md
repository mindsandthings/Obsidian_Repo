# Plot threads
## Ghost girl/history/wars
~~Translation spell should give you the appropriate vernacular

are En's family musicians and water dwellers? 

Aimee would have the translation spell, meaning she'd hear the butterflies and later hear what Chrys is saying to Bellflower. She also needs to be able to hear the ghost girlâ€”think about how to play this so that Amaryllis still has the bulk of the spell. 


## Favor debt
~~should blood play a role in the favor tokens? yes

## General
~~more focus on Summerstart festival, show it throughout

## caterpillars/army/manuals
work out so that Aimee knows how to transfer the army, and make it clear in the ghost girl appearance that that's what they're going to do â€” since lily needs to know it's a possibility


## Kraken
Where to put the flip / gravity stuff? Do need to address it - it's why some areas are down/flooded and others up/unflooded, right near the surface - maybe Madison and Aimee go through it on their way out of the vaults. 


## Heist
Bellflower needs to leave some supplies for Hyacinth and a note
She should leave water, antibiotic ointment, a mirror and bandages definitely
And antibiotics if she has them like penicillin or something generic like that
Unless heâ€™s allergic ðŸ¤”
she'd leave a note with it saying "don't use this if you're allergic" also with instructions for put it on don't eat it
Abs I says a mirror so he can apply ointment and wrap his head without guessing
Oh and steri strips
Which are strips that are sticky that can hold together a laceration without stitches
And maybe food. Like a protein shake or granola bar or something to make sure his blood sugar stays up
a blanket


### Lily's golf cart
Chrys knew Bellflower went on a horse - she'd notice the extra golf cart. Maybe she assumes Aimee and Madison arrived separately? Maybe I can make Aimee and Madison crowd into a one-person transit thing? Or maybe there isn't an extra golf cart, and Lily took a horse but had to tether it at the edge of the crater. If so, Bellflower should remember that Aimee mentioned wanting to avoid her internship supervisor.

### Location
How does Lily select the location for the harvester worm tunnel portal? Can you get the next stop's location from the quarry? If so, why wouldn't B have that already? ==Also, where the hell is the kid ghost girl's tour appearance? Need to write that in. 

In the vaults, Flyer needs to say "meet you at the high ground by the [thing]"

Madison and Lily: they have a specific portal preprogrammed to open up back here, so why not just wait? Or: they don't and were hoping for a random one. Or: they're planning to go around starside to a known route to the top (super dangerous if I want Flyer to need the butterflies for this! but Lily has kraken poison). Maybe Bellflower has got repellent for whatever will attack them starside? And Flyer didn't


Lily has the coordinates of the tunneling expedition, and knows that it was filled in with concrete [graystone slurry]; she's hoping to find an easier, closer way there, but needs to know where the high ground is (the inner edge of the harvester nest). She gets that from the ghost girl's appearances and matches it to the map she has that the ghost girl's ancestors gave to the invaders, which included significant features but not waterlines. 

After the invaders moved the kraken, the ghost girl and En tunneled through from the harvester nest to the vault area. 

That was still open, however the hallway to the vault and the hatchery was blocked off with concrete. 

Lily also knows 
They had to tunnel down to get heavy equipment to the stars. There are smaller passages from star-side back through the basement to the surfaces; Lily plans to go out the harvester worm nest to one of these. She already tried to go in but the passages are trapped to heck and back and there are tons of them; it's unclear which she'd need to take. 






### Timeline
Timeline! For kraken poisoning! At least a few days earlier, for the caterpillars
Nail down dates for Lily bringing the device through, and Lily poisoning the kraken. 


### Components
Do I want to make the components iron/magnetite/something like that? 




----------
# Secondary characters
## Chrys
Bring back thread about her obsession with Madison; make sure it shows up in B's relations to her

## Lily
Her characterization is uneven. Work on this. 

change Lily to Spider Lily? 


### What does Lily tell Madison
Madison needs to know enough about the vault key to figure out she can use it to open the vault. Lily was planning to use her to get through the field, which is especially bad for talented faeries. 

So Lily tells her they're after a treasure the Courts have locked up that will provide an unlimited power source, and that the Courts are using it to prevent competitors. Lily has not told Madison she's working for the magic schools. 


# Bellflower

## Autonomy
need to get in a story about B's magic school classmates somewhere

The Bellflower-autonomy-Courts thread needs to connect with the Bellflower-autonomy-Lily thread. 

## Hyacinth/portal project
Feels undeveloped
-- how does B feel about the prospect of having portals for short-range travel??? she'd find the lowered effort appealing, but miss the journey. 

## Ghost girl
-- was Flyer responsible for ensuring the invader died? or would he have died anyway?affects B's thoughts about her in the final scene. 
-- B needs to also be worried about the manual hurting whoever gets it!!!
-- I dropped the "B wants to solve the ghost girl mystery with the wisdom of age" thread. Do I want to take it back up?

# Aimee
give Aimee an employee ID tattoo
play up butterflies being mental static / tinnitus reduction for Aimee

## FPA
what does FPA say about talents / prohibited talents? 

## Bellflower
When does B tell Aimee she's going to tell Chrys? Before the fight? After the fight? On the way out? This is also the point that B learns that Chrys tried to intimidate her. 

Turn it back to a rabbit? 

## Madison
I'd like to do a better job of the Aimee-Madison dynamic

  # FPA  

Faerie Court Holdings, Inc., the IP holder for both the parks and the children's series

Series based on aesthetics of CourtÂ   

Aimee focused on series because she knows she can't afford to go see the Courts

Aimee also follows the official Court instagrams.Â 

The early books - the good ones - all went out of print

How does Aimee know Madison might be a fan?Â 


FPANYR:

-- luxurious descriptions of clothing - a very visual, knowledgeable writer, and a highly skilled illustrator and cover artist

-- slightly stilted dialogue and cheesy plot but great voice actors. high action, lots of fights and fashion. usually highlighting one or more aspects that are basically attractions. also Court famous animals.Â 

-- chapter books

-- main 2 princesses, but also (not real) "cousins" from other realms

-- early books high quality, one person's project. later got more popular and by committee but a few were still really good, and descriptions remained amazing

-- reflect moral lessons of faerie culture - favor debt balance, wars, ecosystem management, spellworkers and exploitation, magic talents and exploitation, very advanced consent culture (ask before touching anyone - prohibited talents), taboos against creche mining, the dangers of neuromagic, demons, dangers of looting, vegetarianism
however it does not address prohibited talents directly, only by metaphor

-- need to settle on some princess names

--
