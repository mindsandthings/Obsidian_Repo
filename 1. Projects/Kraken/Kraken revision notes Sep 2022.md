#### What does Lily tell Madison
Madison needs to know enough about the vault key to figure out she can use it to open the vault. Lily was planning to use her to get through the field, which is especially bad for talented faeries. 

So Lily tells her they're after a treasure the Courts have locked up that will provide an unlimited power source, and that the Courts are using it to prevent competitors. Lily has not told Madison she's working for the magic schools.

Do I want to make the components iron/magnetite/something like that? 

Turn it back to a rabbit? 

Nail down dates for Lily bringing the device through, and Lily poisoning the kraken. 

what does FPA say about talents / prohibited talents? 

give Aimee an employee ID tattoo

should blood play a role in the favor tokens? 

I'd like to do a better job of the Aimee-Madison dynamic


-- do I need to add back in arcs for the secondary characters? (yes)
-- I dropped the "B wants to solve the ghost girl mystery with the wisdom of age" thread. Do I want to take it back up?
-- more focus on Summerstart festival, show it throughout
-- can I get the reception scene to do more, backstory-wise?


-- Hyacinth and the portal project still feel underdeveloped
-- so do B's thoughts on them while she's in the basements
-- maybe make a list of continuity touchstones? The summer start festival, Aimee's faeriesonas/humansonas, something for Bellflower? 
testing this note
Bellflower is aware that her mother was targeting Aimee and other interns, and should worry about them
-- was Flyer responsible for ensuring the invader died? or would he have died anyway?affects B's thoughts about her in the final scene. 
-- how does B feel about the prospect of having portals for short-range travel??? she'd find the lowered effort appealing, but miss the journey. 
-- B on the people with prohibited talents: she wasn't going to think of them as *her* people, but....
-- B needs to also be worried about the manual hurting whoever gets it!!!
-- What does B think about Hyacinth and his relation to his job? work this in earlier. 


play up butterflies being mental static / tinnitus reduction for Aimee

Chrys knew Bellflower went on a horse - she'd notice the extra golf cart. Maybe she assumes Aimee and Madison arrived separately? Maybe I can make Aimee and Madison crowd into a one-person transit thing? Or maybe there isn't an extra golf cart, and Lily took a horse but had to tether it at the edge of the crater. If so, Bellflower should remember that Aimee mentioned wanting to avoid her internship supervisor.

need to get in a story about B's magic school classmates somewhere

The Bellflower-autonomy-Courts thread needs to connect with the Bellflower-autonomy-Lily thread. 

Madison and Lily: they have a specific portal preprogrammed to open up back here, so why not just wait? Or: they don't and were hoping for a random one. Or: they're planning to go around starside to a known route to the top (super dangerous if I want Flyer to need the butterflies for this! but Lily has kraken poison). Maybe Bellflower has got repellent for whatever will attack them starside? And Flyer didn't

change Lily to Spider Lily? 

**Where is the thread about Chrys suspecting Madison? 

Lily characterization uneven

Faerie Court Holdings, Inc., the IP holder for both the parks and the children's series

  

Series based on aesthetics of Court 

  

Aimee focused on series because she knows she can't afford to go see the Courts

  

Aimee also follows the official Court instagrams. 

  

The early books - the good ones - all went out of print

  

How does Aimee know Madison might be a fan? 

  

FPANYR:

-- luxurious descriptions of clothing - a very visual, knowledgeable writer, and a highly skilled illustrator and cover artist

-- slightly stilted dialogue and cheesy plot but great voice actors. high action, lots of fights and fashion. usually highlighting one or more aspects that are basically attractions. also Court famous animals. 

-- chapter books

-- main 2 princesses, but also (not real) "cousins" from other realms

-- early books high quality, one person's project. later got more popular and by committee but a few were still really good, and descriptions remained amazing

-- reflect moral lessons of faerie culture - favor debt balance, wars, ecosystem management, spellworkers and exploitation, magic talents and exploitation, very advanced consent culture (ask before touching anyone - prohibited talents), taboos against creche mining, the dangers of neuromagic, demons, dangers of looting, vegetarianism

-- need to settle on some princess names

--
