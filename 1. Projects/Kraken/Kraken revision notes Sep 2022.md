-- do I need to add back in arcs for the secondary characters? (yes)
-- I dropped the "B wants to solve the ghost girl mystery with the wisdom of age" thread. Do I want to take it back up?
-- more focus on Summerstart festival, show it throughout
-- can I get the reception scene to do more, backstory-wise?
-- Hyacinth and the portal project still feel underdeveloped
-- so do B's thoughts on them while she's in the basements
-- maybe make a list of continuity touchstones? The summer start festival, Aimee's faeriesonas/humansonas, something for Bellflower? 
testing this note
Bellflower is aware that her mother was targeting Aimee and other interns, and should worry about them

Chrys knew Bellflower went on a horse - she'd notice the extra golf cart. Maybe she assumes Aimee and Madison arrived separately? Maybe I can make Aimee and Madison crowd into a one-person transit thing? Or maybe there isn't an extra golf cart, and Lily took a horse but had to tether it at the edge of the crater. If so, Bellflower should remember that Aimee mentioned wanting to avoid her internship supervisor.

need to get in a story about B's magic school classmates somewhere

The Bellflower-autonomy-Courts thread needs to connect with the Bellflower-autonomy-Lily thread. 

Madison and Lily: they have a specific portal preprogrammed to open up back here, so why not just wait? Or: they don't and were hoping for a random one. Or: they're planning to go around starside to a known route to the top (super dangerous if I want Flyer to need the butterflies for this! but Lily has kraken poison). Maybe Bellflower has got repellent for whatever will attack them starside? And Flyer didn't
