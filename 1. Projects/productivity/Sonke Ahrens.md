Sonke Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes:

"Whenever you read something, make notes about the content. Write down what you don't want to forget or think you might use in your own thinking or writing. Keep it very short, be extremely selective, and use your own words."

Make permanent notes by reviewing that info and developing ideas, arguments, and discussions. Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else (full sentences, dislclose courses, make references, try to be as precise, clear, and brief as possible). 

When writing, look for chains of notes that have developed.
