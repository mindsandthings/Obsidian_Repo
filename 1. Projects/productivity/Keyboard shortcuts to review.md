`⌘ + ↵`: Open the file in a new pane.
`⌥ + ↵`: Reveal the file in Finder.
`ctrl + ↵`: Append the content to the selected note.
-   Add `filename` or `title` to your search query, to display only files and no aliases, folders, or headings. For example, `o obsidian filename` will display only notes that have the `obsidian` in their filename.
-   Similarly, you can also filter for starred or recent files by adding `starred` or `recent` to your query.
-   When browsing a folder, you also have the ⌥ion to create a new note _in that folder_. Will use the template note defined in the [workflow configuration](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-obsidian/blob/main/docs/Workflow%20Configuration.md#New-Note-Creation) `template_note_path`.
Headings are displayed as part of the search. 
ol to browse links of current note, or use up-return on any search result to browse its links
After major updates of the Obsidian documentation, this Alfred workflow needs to recreate its index of the Obsidian documentation. You can do so by selecting the respective option when typing keyword oupdate. (Index recreation can take a few seconds depending on your internet connection. You will be notified when it is done.)

***appending to notes not working

obsidian://open?vault=Regular&file=daily%2F2022-09-05

## Obsidian-alfred
**Works to append to a single prespecified note, but not to a daily note. 

Open a daily note in a vault: od (@technicalpickles, @luckman212)

    You can also customize your Hotkey to open your daily note.

Create or open tomorrow's daily note: otmr
Adding/appending text to an inbox note: oi (@LouisInFlow)

    You can also customize your Hotkey to directly append clipboard contents to the inbox note.
    Open inbox note with oii or customize your Hotkey to open inbox note.
    Turn on/off notifications when adding text to inbox note with onotify

Adding/appending text to daily note: odi

    You must run the od command first (once per day) before using odi
