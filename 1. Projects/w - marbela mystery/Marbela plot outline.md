Cyrus's blobfish grandfather, Cyrano, grew up good friends with Octavia and Mr. Shramply. All three were interested in puzzles. When Mr. Shramply moved away after elementary school, Cyrano and Octavia kept up their friendship—but cooked up an apparent enemyship because Octavia's family disliked blobfish, who are poor. When they realized it served as a great publicity for both their careers (Octavia's puzzles, Cyrano's photography), they kept it going, with Cyrano serving as the heel. Mayor Myrtle knew of the enemyship but didn't know it was an act. Cyrus knows of the friendship, and feels devoted to Octavia's memory. 

Another shrimp (Shrimposter) representing a rival puzzle contest posed as an adult Mr. Shramply in order to reestablish a friendship with Cyrano and Octavia so he could sabotage their businesses. It was partially successful...until the real Mr. Shramply showed up and exposed him to Cyrano. 

Mr. Shramply didn't want the Shrimposter exposed because he was Mr. Shramply's brother; it would be a scandal for the family. Unfortunately, at that point the Shrimposter had blackmail material on Octavia, who had once been arrested for possession. Out of love for Octavia, Cyrano and Mr. Shramply decided not to expose the Shrimposter and risk revealing Octavia's secret. So they made out SHrimposter's sabotage to be part of the rivalry and done by Cyrano, and Mr. Shramply—who was moving back to town—took the shrimposter's place. 

So they just threatened him with exposure instead. He wanted to avoid a scandal as much as Mr. Shramply and bailed. Mr. Shramply has not seen him in many years, but knows that he keeps up with the puzzle news, and suspected info about the mural would draw him back if he thought he might be exposed—and now that Octavia is dead, the risks of exposure to her are gone, and he's quite old and dying, so the risks to him are minimal. But he thought his brother would paint over the mural, not steal it. So he hired Lifi and gave her the suggestion for what to research. 

Cyrus thinks Octavia's descendant faked her will because he found Octavia's diary about Shrimposter doing awful things. He believes that having Mr. Shramply run the museum is awful—but Mr. Shramply is too powerful to be challenged. Mr. Shramply is quite sad as he would like to have Cyrus as a nephew. 

Mademoiselle Lifi did research for the mural at the library. It depicts Ocean Depths' history, and accurately shows both the role of sharks and octopuses...and Cyrus's grandfather...and the Shrimposter. Consequently, she's convinced the real Mr. Shramply is the imposter. 

Shrimposter was there last night and stole the mural, and has been in the crowd today, hiding beneath the starfish's top hat. He always likes to stick around the see the chaotic results of his actions. 

Meanwhile, Aria discovered that her cousin Paisley was dating a hammerhead shark, and since Aria is a meter maid, she started following Paisley and ticketing her car every time she spent the night at the shark's place. Paisley is upset about this but can't tell anyone without them finding out.
