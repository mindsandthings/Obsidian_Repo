Bring in the five senses when showing setting. 

Book One: sleuth and recurrent characters. 

# Creating the sleuth
* Do your research and include job-oriented details and references to immerse the reader in this unique environment.

Your protagonist should be in a situation that brings her into contact with many people, or else her social circle must provide the same purpose. If she has a job, she is able to get time off to investigate the crime while still running errands and doing chores like the rest of us.

She may look for the best in people, but she questions her assumptions when obvious clues fly in her face.


- [ ] #task Also establish the sleuth’s short and long term goals. What does she want now? How about five years ahead? Maybe her short-term goal is to become financially independent.

Give her a concrete symbol of her ultimate dream. 

- [ ] #task Give her a personal reason for wanting to solve the murder. What's at stake if the crime isn't solved? Create two threads, one for the crime scene and one for your sleuth as a person.

- [ ] #task She needs to have some hang-ups at the start that can be overcome throughout the course of a series. This is the overall character arc. For each title, this person also needs to come to an insight about herself by the end of the book.

- [ ] #task To get inside your sleuth’s head, draw her Life Space. Start with a circle and write her name in it. Then add cartoon-like bubbles around her head. Inside of these bubbles, put her concerns at any given moment in time. What’s on her mind right now? This will provide insight into your character’s interests.

# Subplots
- [ ] #task Come up with a related subplot
Just like friends in real life, people come and go as subjects for subplots. These characters help to showcase our protagonist’s life as she responds to the situation. Here are some suggestions that you might use in your story: 
__Romance__ 
Between man and woman 
Old flame returns to town 
Love triangle 
Between secondary characters 
**Family** 
Sibling who always gets in trouble 
Sick child, rebellious child, competitive child 
Father/son issues, Mother/daughter issues 
Holidays or Celebrations can cause tensions to rise 
**Work** 
Bad boss 
Mean co-worker 
Competition for promotion 
Project deadline 
Housing/Neighbor Issues 
Financial Issues

# Suspects (six to eight)
## Establish the crime scene
Who?
Where?
What? Knowledge, means, and opportunity. 
Why?
When? 
How does the killer get away? 

Make it clear in story blurb that it doesn't contain a murder mystery. 

Marbela: Is the art stolen, or destroyed? What is the wall a wall of - the puzzle museum? 

## How can you avoid police involvement? 


## Create the suspects
Give everyone a motive and connection and assign everyone a secret. 

## Choose the villain
Give your bad guy his own personal agenda. Why is this goal important to him? What is he doing to attain this objective? How do his actions affect the other characters? While you can hint at the villain’s motives, the real reasons behind the murder aren’t revealed until the final confrontation. 
* Allow him to care about something to show his humanity. i.e. He may think nothing about bumping off the opposition, but he loves his dog. 
* Have a “good” villain as well as a “bad” villain, i.e. an official who obstructs the heroine’s efforts. The stronger the villain, the more stalwart the heroine must be to defeat him. 
* The villain may have a twisted view of the universe. In other words, he doesn’t see himself as being evil. His cause is just in his mind. This will only come to light during his confession at the end.
* Trick the reader now and then by having two villains. For example, one could be guilty of the first murder, and a different person could be guilty of the second one. Just when the heroine thinks she’s safe because the bad guy is behind bars, she finds another clue that makes her realize there’s a different killer out there. A secondary climactic scene occurs.

## Establish their motives
Here are some possible negative motivators for your murderer. Remember in a cozy, you want a personal motive for the crime. And while all suspects may seem guilty, the true motivating factor isn’t revealed until the end. 
* Protect a secret, i.e. baby given up for adoption 
* Preserve reputation 
* Protection of a loved one 
* Clear an obstacle to a goal 
* Fear of discovery; Remove threat of exposure 
* Hidden identity 
* Greed 
* Jealousy/Envy 
* Love turned to Hate 
* Revenge 
* Having an affair 
* End source of blackmail 
* Filed for divorce/planning to leave spouse 
* Get rid of rival for loved one, promotion, or award 
* Covering up past or current misdeeds 
* Got fired or about to be fired

## Link your suspects
Next you’ll want to link your suspects to each other. Here’s an example of how this works: 
1. Alice is resentful of Dara, her boss, because Dara denied her a job promotion. 
2. Dara is murdered. Did Alice kill her out of spite? Or does she have a stronger reason? 
3. Alice is secretly having an affair with Brent, who is Dara’s business partner. If Dara had found out, she would have fired Alice. This gives Alice a credible motive to eliminate Dara. Or maybe Dara had already discovered Alice’s liaison with Brent. 
4. But it also gives Brent a motive, because Dara thought Brent cared for her. If she found out about his affair with Alice, Dara might have revealed his corrupt dealings with one of their subsidiaries. He couldn’t allow this to happen. 
5. Brent, as Dara’s successor, takes over her half of the company. Could greed have been another possible motive for him? 
6. Michael, Dara’s brother, is glad she’s taken a family secret to the grave. He doesn’t know that Dara confided in Brent. Had Dara threatened to reveal this secret before she died?

# Heightening suspense
* Put likable characters at risk
* Add a time bomb
* Give your character some down time (romantic interlude, or review the suspects) to vary teh pacing
* Add another dead body or a plot twist
* Short paragraphs, skip long expository passages

The midpoint should raise the stakes and deepen the puzzle. 

Be careful about dropping hints about future events; it can cause you to lose immediacy. 

Stay in your character's skin. 

## When should the body show up?
Either put the body up front to capture interest, or introduce the suspects faster to make the reader wonder who will die
Or if you have an engaging voice, show the sleuth in her normal life before the mystery starts
