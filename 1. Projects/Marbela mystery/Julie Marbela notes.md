How about art? Like a REALLY dramatic famous leafy sea dragon artist had a painting stolen at a gallery showing

You sent

by stealing an entire wall

Julia

Julia Hedge

Or that that’s neat too!

You sent

art theft is a good one!

Julia

Julia Hedge

I like that gives me da Vinci code vibes

You sent

maybe it was an outdoor gallery showing

👍

You sent

they hide it behind a curtain and then dramatically reveal the curtain

You sent

and the wall is gone

No one has seen or heard anything! No one has seen or heard anything! So Detective Axl Olt Holmes is called to the scene to assist!

he is a very very famous detective!
and also has no idea what he's doing
At the same time

and Marbela is like "gosh, he's going to need some help!"

Silly and slightly oblivious to his surroundings

He solves mysteries on accident most of the time

he has a magnifying glass and keeps looking at things that could not possibly be related to the crime and going "a clue!"

Julia

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Julia

I just laughed out loud

❤️

Julia

Julia Hedge

Whenever he holds the magnifying glass up to his face it has a mustache drawn on it

His kids did it and they think it’s hilarious

Marbela is like "oh dear, who do I know who does know how to solve mysteries. who is incisive and insightful"

Julia

Julia Hedge

Or maybe the student did it and she thinks it’s hilarious

You sent

and then she thinks of Marble's student'

You sent

Maybe every time he holds it to his face she could have drawn something siffferent

Julia

Julia Hedge

Like a cigar

You sent

they all think he's doing it on purpose to be as funny as he is famous

You sent

but he has no idea

Julia

😂😂😂

Julia

Not a CLUE

Julia

Julia Hedge

Literally 😂💀

You sent

hahahaha

Julia

Julia Hedge

Long Eyelashes one time

You sent

yes

Marbela sees he has no idea what he's doing, and so she goes to recruit the kindergarten student to help follow him around and make sure he doesn't miss anything. but then he starts treating the kindergarten student like an assistant and handing them the glass to hold

You sent

they've just come from art class and have a full package of underwater sharpies

Julia

YES

Julia

Julia Hedge

perfect hahahaha

I feel like Axolotls don’t have good eyesight anyway 😂

Julia

🤣🤣

Julia

Open photo

Julia

They’re basically blind lmao

Julia

Julia Hedge

OOOH

You sent

well that's why he needs an eyeglass

Julia

he could have narcolepsy bc he’s nocturnal and fall asleep in random places

Julia

Julia Hedge

Like on top of real life clues and that’s why he solves mysteries by accident bc people find him near the clues and they assume he solves the mystery

You sent

we can also come up with suspects

You sent

hahaha

You sent

but it's really them noticing the clues and figuring it out

Julia

Yepppp

Julia

How about an eel

Julia

Julia Hedge

As a suspect

You sent

yes

Julia

Julia Hedge

They’re kind of slippery and sneaky by nature

Myrtle has many kindergarten students!

a. Trying to be prematurely grown up. Very serious. Very studious. Probably needs to learn to relax.

b. A little hellion, always getting into things. Once Myrtle left her makeup kit out and the kid made a wall mural out of it. If this kid were kidnapped, the kidnappers would wind up paying a ransom to get the parents to take the kid back.

c.

Which sea animals would you most enjoy drawing?

a. fish

b.

b. Myrtle, the harmonica-playing manatee mayor who teaches kindergartners about civic participation

c. One of Myrtle's kindergartner students

Thinks I liked about the marbela story: her personality was really interesting and captivating.

Under the sea stuff I love so that makes me happy

I did like pictures from the Fifi story maybe we can do more pictures for marbela

I liked illustrating marbela as well maybe I can work on other characters too

I liked the length of the marbela story it kept me interested and didn’t have any down time.
