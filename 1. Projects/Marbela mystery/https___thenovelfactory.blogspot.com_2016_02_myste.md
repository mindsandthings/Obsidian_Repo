# Mystery Plot Template / Story Beats / Roadmap

In [the Novel Factory](http://www.novel-software.com/), we use a Universal Storyline template based on the Hero's Journey, and we've created a few more targeted structure templates for common genres, such as Romance and Mystery.
However, we've been asked a few times if we can develop these further and tailor them more closely to those genres.
So, we've researched and read and scoured the web and are proud to present the Mystery Plot Template!
Obviously, a template is only ever intended to be a starting point and a guide, and should not be taken as hard and fast laws. Take it, shake it up and deviate from it.
It's a tool, not a rule.
