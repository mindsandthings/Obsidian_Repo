The museum courtyard was packed. Manatees and minnows, seahorses and salmon, turtles and trumpetfish circulated among the reception tables, gossiping and chatting, occasionally glancing toward the great red curtains concealing the soon-to-be-revealed wall mural. 

At the edge of the courtyard, Marbela gathered her courage and her catering trays. Balancing the trays on six of her arms, she tippy-toed through the crowd on her other two, her twin hearts thumping with hope. This was the day that someone would try her new invention and hopefully, hopefully, give it a five-star review on Kelp.

## Who should she approach first?

a. A starfish with several top hats and an expensive-looking monocle. 
b. A hungry-looking herring art student with smears of paint on his fins. 
c. The museum's proprietor, a stuffy-looking shrimp. 
d. Myrtle, the manatee mayor, who looks busy but is usually glad to see Marbela.
e. A member of Myrtle's kindergarten class, a manatee floating off at the edge of the crowd with his nose in a book.

There: in the corner of the courtyard, someone she recognized. A manatee kindergartner floated lumpily, his nose in a book. 

Better unload some of her snacks first, though. Hungry crowds shouldn't stay hungry. 

"Spiced anemones! Mussel wraps! Mollusk patties! Free, courtesy of the mayor!" 

"Free" was the magic word. A school of herrings descended, art students from the college across the way. They flurried around her, snapping food off the trays like aspiring piranhas. 

She whipped the tray with her experimental drink out of the way just in time, tucking it beneath her mantle. 

The art students rose, leaving her other two trays bare. 

The manatee kindergartner was watching her over the edge of the book. He had a body like a cluster of comfy marshmallows and an expression of jaded boredom that rivaled a high school goth's. 

A quiver of worry rippled up Marbela's arms. He was going to be a tough customer. But she had a good product and she could do this. 

She firmed her grip on the trays and headed over. 

## Marbela has faith in her experimental drink's deliciousness, but she also knows that you have to have that interpersonal touch. How should she approach him? 

a. Connect with him. Mention where they know each other from. 

b. Empathize with him. There aren't a lot of kids here. He's probably really bored. 

c. Establish an interest in what he likes. Ask him what he's reading. 

d. Feed him. Offer him a non-experimental product first. 


# a. Connect with him. Mention where they know each other from. 

The kindergartner had his book out in front of him like a shield. His facial expression was the equivalent of saying in a deadpan monotone, "*Oh look, someone is coming to interrupt my reading. What a terribly surprising surprise.*" 

Marbela felt like her breakfast had come back to life and was wriggling around in her stomach. She always felt awful when people seemed to immediately dislike her. But she hadn't worked for a catering company for an entire two weeks without learning to hide her stomach-churning nervousness under her normal cheerful demeanor. "Hi! I think I know you from the Key of Sea concert."

His jowls drooped in a frown. Then his demeanor shifted into grudging respect. He lowered his book. "You're the videographer."

Her breakfast ceased its escape attempts. "That's me!" 

A small frown crept back on to his face. "What happened to your camera?"

"My camera? It's at home, why—oh!" She realized what he meant. "I'm not here as a videographer. I'm a catering assistant." With a practiced-in-front-of-the-mirror swoop, she brought forth the tray with her experimental drink. "I'm a food artist, too."

"A food artist." He inspected the drink close up, turning his head to view it with each eye, then skewered her with a skeptical gaze. "Where's the art?" 

"It's not in the look. It's in the taste." This was the critical moment. Once he tasted it, she knew he'd be sold. She'd workshopped this drink to heck and back, making her friend Tarquin and his bandmates try every single recipe and fill out surveys on them. 

## What's Marbela's pitch?

a. Cost. Kindergartners don't get much of an allowance. "Free sample? On the house."

b. Novelty. He looks like he exists in a state of existential boredom. "It's unforgettable. Like nothing you've had before."

c. Metaphor. Make the unfamiliar familiar. "It's like a wall mural for your tastebuds."

d. Exoticness and sophistication. "It's based on a traditional human dish that I once tasted myself."

# b. Novelty. He looks like he exists in a state of existential boredom. "It's unforgettable. Like nothing you've had before."

She tilted the tray toward him, catching the drink's surface in a cooperative glimmer of light. "The Marbelini is unforgettable. Like nothing you've had before."

Both his flippers rose in a galumphing shrug. "Sure. Why not. I haven't had my morning snack." His tone said *Adults sure think kids are gullible, huh.*

He took the drink and sipped. A series of emotions swarmed over his face, too quick for Marbela to tell apart.  

Behind her back, Marbela felt her arms knot together nervously. 

And just like that, he was back to boredom. "It's not terrible." He had the firmness of a movie critic giving a movie a solid two stars. 

Marbela's hearts drifted downward in mutual disappointment. There went her good Kelp review. "I'll get you an algae smoothie instead." She reached out to take her drink back. 

For a manatee, he moved fast. The drink was out of range before she could  grasp it. 

"I didn't say I didn't want it." He looked uncomfortable, like she'd caught him in a lie. "It isn't...bad." He glanced side to side like he was checking that no one was watching him actually enjoy something, and took a big gulp. 

The bottom of the ocean felt suddenly as warm and sunny as the surface. "I knew it!" She had known he would like it. Maybe it had taken a minute for him to figure out he liked it or maybe he was trying to look cool, but he did like it. 

The thump and screech of a microphone interrupted. Mayor Myrtle had  stepped up to a podium near the curtained wall mural. "We'll get started in just a moment. Please grab a refreshment and gather round."


## Marbela needs to get back to work. What should she say to the manatee kid first?

a. Straight-up ask him for a Kelp review. She's sure he's on board. 

b. Maybe she shouldn't be 100% sure he's on board to the tune of five stars. Ask him to help her test more recipes. 

c. Invite him to get another Marbelini after the art unveiling, so she can figure out how to politely and indirectly ask how many stars he would give her.  

# c. Invite him to get another Marbelini after the art unveiling, so she can figure out how to politely and indirectly ask how many stars he would give her.  

The catering station was about to get rushed. Marbela's boss, Paisley, would need her. No time to find out if the kid liked the Marbelini enough for five stars. 

"Come by after the mural unveiling," she told the kid. "I can make you another one."

He nodded solemnly and stuck his face back in his book. The cover read *Wikipedia Jones and the Mystery of the Mariana Trench.* Marbela wondered if it was good. She'd have to ask later. 

At the catering station, Paisley already had all eight arms full serving customers. With a sideways nod, she gestured for Marbela to pull out another tray of mollusks. 

The next few minutes were a whirlwind of customers and food. When the eddies subsided, they were down to a half-tray of mollusks and one lone mussel wrap. 

Paisley nodded her head toward Mayor Myrtle, who was adjusting the podium microphone. "She shoulda ordered more." Paisley's pink-and-blue ombre bow was askew and she was flushed a dull, tired red. "I'm going inside the museum to freshen up."

Marbela took Paisley's place and began clearing the empty trays. She was sure Mayor Myrtle had ordered as many refreshments as she thought they'd need. Who would have known that a mural unveiling would be so popular?

Mayor Myrtle cleared her throat. "I'd like to welcome you all here today—"

"This is a travesty!" A blobfish floated up out of the crowd. "What would Augusta say if she were here today?"

The mayor gave him a firm, authoritative look. "I imagine, Cyrus, that she would ask you to sit down. She made her wishes quite clear in her will—"

The blobfish bristled. To the extent that any blobfish could look angry and prickly, he did. "The will is fake!" 

Gasps from the crowd. Marbela found her arms twisting nervously together again. She'd known there was some kind of scandal over Augusta's will, but she thought it had been resolved. Some of Augusta's grandchildren were in the crowd; they must be so embarrassed that someone was making a public scene. 

"Her will was verified by her descendants," Mayor Myrtle said calmly. "Yes, Aria?"

An octopus near the front had an arm raised. "Just because my grandmother won the Ocean Depths puzzle contest against your grandmother five years running does not give you the right to show up at an event held in her honor and accuse us of faking her will!"

The blobfish bristled even further. "That is not why I'm here!"

Marbela looked around. Where was security? She thought she'd seen at least one security guard when they'd been setting up, a hammerhead shark. But she didn't see him now. 


What should Marbela do? Pick up to 2. 

a. The museum entrance is nearby. Duck inside and look for the guard. 

b. Stay at her catering station, but ask someone nearby to duck inside and look for the guard. 

c. Hold tight and let Mayor Myrtle handle things. 

d. Keep herself calm. Mix up another couple Marbelinis.
