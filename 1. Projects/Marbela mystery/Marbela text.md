# Chapter 1: The mural

The museum courtyard was packed. Manatees and minnows, seahorses and salmon, turtles and trumpetfish circulated among the reception tables, gossiping and chatting, occasionally glancing toward the great red curtains concealing the soon-to-be-revealed wall mural. 

At the edge of the courtyard, Marbela gathered her courage and her catering trays. Balancing the trays on six of her arms, she tippy-toed through the crowd on her other two, her twin hearts thumping with hope. This was the day that someone would try her new invention and hopefully, hopefully, give it a five-star review on Kelp.

### Who should she approach first?

a. A starfish with several top hats and an expensive-looking monocle. 
b. A hungry-looking herring art student with smears of paint on his fins. 
c. The museum's proprietor, a stuffy-looking shrimp. 
d. Myrtle, the manatee mayor, who looks busy but is usually glad to see Marbela.
e. A member of Myrtle's kindergarten class, a manatee floating off at the edge of the crowd with his nose in a book.  

## e. A member of Myrtle's kindergarten class, a manatee floating off at the edge of the crowd with his nose in a book.  

There: in the corner of the courtyard, someone she recognized. A manatee kindergartner floated lumpily, his nose in a book. 

Better unload some of her snacks first, though. Hungry crowds shouldn't stay hungry. 

"Spiced anemones! Mussel wraps! Mollusk patties! Free, courtesy of the mayor!" 

"Free" was the magic word. A school of herrings descended, art students from the college across the way. They flurried around her, snapping food off the trays like aspiring piranhas. 

She whipped the tray with her experimental drink out of the way just in time, tucking it beneath her mantle. 

The art students rose, leaving her other two trays bare. 

The manatee kindergartner was watching her over the edge of the book. He had a body like a cluster of comfy marshmallows and an expression of jaded boredom that rivaled a high school goth's. 

A quiver of worry rippled up Marbela's arms. He was going to be a tough customer. But she had a good product and she could do this. 

She firmed her grip on the trays and headed over. 

### Marbela has faith in her experimental drink's deliciousness, but she also knows that you have to have that interpersonal touch. How should she approach him? 

a. Connect with him. Mention where they know each other from. 

b. Empathize with him. There aren't a lot of kids here. He's probably really bored. 

c. Establish an interest in what he likes. Ask him what he's reading. 

d. Feed him. Offer him a non-experimental product first. 


## a. Connect with him. Mention where they know each other from. 

The kindergartner had his book out in front of him like a shield. His facial expression was the equivalent of saying in a deadpan monotone, "*Oh look, someone is coming to interrupt my reading. What a terribly surprising surprise.*" 

Marbela felt like her breakfast had come back to life and was wriggling around in her stomach. She always felt awful when people seemed to immediately dislike her. But she hadn't worked for a catering company for an entire two weeks without learning to hide her stomach-churning nervousness under her normal cheerful demeanor. "Hi! I think I know you from the Key of Sea concert."

His jowls drooped in a frown. Then his demeanor shifted into grudging respect. He lowered his book. "You're the videographer."

Her breakfast ceased its escape attempts. "That's me!" 

A small frown crept back on to his face. "What happened to your camera?"

"My camera? It's at home, why—oh!" She realized what he meant. "I'm not here as a videographer. I'm a catering assistant." With a practiced-in-front-of-the-mirror swoop, she brought forth the tray with her experimental drink. "I'm a food artist, too."

"A food artist." He inspected the drink close up, turning his head to view it with each eye, then skewered her with a skeptical gaze. "Where's the art?" 

"It's not in the look. It's in the taste." This was the critical moment. Once he tasted it, she knew he'd be sold. She'd workshopped this drink to heck and back, making her friend Tarquin and his bandmates try every single recipe and fill out surveys on them. 

### What's Marbela's pitch?

a. Cost. Kindergartners don't get much of an allowance. "Free sample? On the house."

b. Novelty. He looks like he exists in a state of existential boredom. "It's unforgettable. Like nothing you've had before."

c. Metaphor. Make the unfamiliar familiar. "It's like a wall mural for your tastebuds."

d. Exoticness and sophistication. "It's based on a traditional human dish that I once tasted myself."

## b. Novelty. He looks like he exists in a state of existential boredom. "It's unforgettable. Like nothing you've had before."

She tilted the tray toward him, catching the drink's surface in a cooperative glimmer of light. "The Marbelini is unforgettable. Like nothing you've had before."

Both his flippers rose in a galumphing shrug. "Sure. Why not. I haven't had my morning snack." His tone said *Adults sure think kids are gullible, huh.*

He took the drink and sipped. A series of emotions swarmed over his face, too quick for Marbela to tell apart.  

Behind her back, Marbela felt her arms knot together nervously. 

And just like that, he was back to boredom. "It's not terrible." He had the firmness of a movie critic giving a movie a solid two stars. 

Marbela's hearts drifted downward in mutual disappointment. There went her good Kelp review. "I'll get you an algae smoothie instead." She reached out to take her drink back. 

For a manatee, he moved fast. The drink was out of range before she could  grasp it. 

"I didn't say I didn't want it." He looked uncomfortable, like she'd caught him in a lie. "It isn't...bad." He glanced side to side like he was checking that no one was watching him actually enjoy something, and took a big gulp. 

The bottom of the ocean felt suddenly as warm and sunny as the surface. "I knew it!" She had known he would like it. Maybe it had taken a minute for him to figure out he liked it or maybe he was trying to look cool, but he did like it. 

The thump and screech of a microphone interrupted. Mayor Myrtle had  stepped up to a podium near the curtained wall mural. "We'll get started in just a moment. Please grab a refreshment and gather round."


### Marbela needs to get back to work. What should she say to the manatee kid first?

a. Straight-up ask him for a Kelp review. She's sure he's on board. 

b. Maybe she shouldn't be 100% sure he's on board to the tune of five stars. Ask him to help her test more recipes. 

c. Invite him to get another Marbelini after the art unveiling, so she can figure out how to politely and indirectly ask how many stars he would give her.  

## c. Invite him to get another Marbelini after the art unveiling, so she can figure out how to politely and indirectly ask how many stars he would give her.  

The catering station was about to get rushed. Marbela's boss, Paisley, would need her. No time to find out if the kid liked the Marbelini enough for five stars. 

"Come by after the mural unveiling," she told the kid. "I can make you another one."

He nodded solemnly and stuck his face back in his book. The cover read *Wikipedia Jones and the Mystery of the Mariana Trench.* Marbela wondered if it was good. She'd have to ask later. 

At the catering station, Paisley already had all eight arms full serving customers. With a sideways nod, she gestured for Marbela to pull out another tray of mollusks. 

The next few minutes were a whirlwind of customers and food. When the eddies subsided, they were down to a half-tray of mollusks and one lone mussel wrap. 

Paisley nodded her head toward Mayor Myrtle, who was adjusting the podium microphone. "She shoulda ordered more." Paisley's pink-and-blue ombre bow was askew and she was flushed a dull, tired red. "I'm going inside the museum to freshen up."

Marbela took Paisley's place and began clearing the empty trays. She was sure Mayor Myrtle had ordered as many refreshments as she thought they'd need. Who would have known that a mural unveiling would be so popular?

Mayor Myrtle cleared her throat. "I'd like to welcome you all here today—"

"This is a travesty!" A blobfish floated up out of the crowd. "What would Augusta say if she were here today?"

The mayor gave him a firm, authoritative look. "I imagine, Cyrus, that she would ask you to sit down. She made her wishes quite clear in her will—"

The blobfish bristled. To the extent that any blobfish could look angry and prickly, he did. "The will is fake!" 

Gasps from the crowd. Marbela found her arms twisting nervously together again. She'd known there was some kind of scandal over Augusta's will, but she thought it had been resolved. Some of Augusta's grandchildren were in the crowd; they must be so embarrassed that someone was making a public scene. 

"Her will was verified by her descendants," Mayor Myrtle said calmly. "Yes, Aria?"

An octopus near the front had an arm raised. "Just because my grandmother won the Ocean Depths puzzle contest against your grandmother five years running does not give you the right to show up at an event held in her honor and accuse us of faking her will!"

The blobfish bristled even further. "That is not why I'm here!"

Marbela looked around. Where was security? She thought she'd seen at least one security guard when they'd been setting up, a hammerhead shark. But she didn't see him now. 


What should Marbela do? Pick up to 2. 

a. The museum entrance is nearby. Duck inside and look for the guard. 

b. Stay at her catering station, but ask someone nearby to duck inside and look for the guard. 

c. Hold tight and let Mayor Myrtle handle things. 

d. Keep herself calm. Mix up another couple Marbelinis. 


## c. Hold tight and let Mayor Myrtle handle things. 

Maybe she should check inside the museum for the security guard. No, maybe she should ask somebody else to check. No, maybe she should stay here. She needed to watch the catering station for Paisley. 

"Cyrus." Mayor Myrtle's voice sounded like she looked: a layer of friendly soft blubber over a solid iron core. "If you don't leave off, I will tell stories about your grandfather. And believe me, I can tell a few."

"This is an outrage." Cyrus's words were strong but his voice wavered and his gaze dropped. He slumped, deflated, and bobbed back into the crowd. 

Mayor Myrtle cleared her throat. "Thanks to a generous bequeathal from Ocean Depths' famous puzzle-maker Augusta, the puzzle museum was able to commission a mural depicting Ocean Depths' history." She gestured toward a leafy sea dragon wearing her weight in costume jewelry. "Thanks to renowned painter Mademoiselle Lifi, the mural was completed in record time." 

Mademoiselle Lifi's jewelry clanked and rattled as she nodded in acknowledgment. "Thank you so very much." She looked surprisingly apprehensive, but maybe she was just anxious about getting a good reception. Marbela felt a pang of sympathy for her. 

"Mr. Shramply, the museum's proprietor—" Mayor Myrtle scanned the crowd, her gaze alighting on an elderly shrimp in an ill-fitting suit— "will now reveal the mural." 

With great ceremony and a little bit of age-related shakiness, Mr. Shramply swam up to the curtain concealing the mural and pulled the cord at its side.

The great red curtain slid slowly back. 

For a moment, Marbela thought that Mademoiselle Lifi had painted a mural of Paisley standing next to the missing security guard. Paisley's expression was wide and startled. Her bow was still askew. 

Then she moved, and Marbela realized it wasn't a mural at all. It was the inside of the museum. The wall was missing. 

Someone had stolen the wall. 

"Sacre bleu! My mural!" Mademoiselle Lifi screamed, and fell over in a dramatic faint.


### What should Marbela do? 

a. Watch Paisley. 

b. Watch the security guard.

c. Watch Mayor Myrtle. 

d. Watch Cyrus, the unhelpful blobfish who accused Augusta's descendants of faking Augusta's will. 

e. Watch Aria, Augusta's descendant who spoke out against Cyrus. 

f. Watch someone else. (The manatee kid? The school of herring art students? The museum's proprietor, a stuffy-looking shrimp? A starfish with several top hats and an expensive-looking monocle?)

g. Bring Mademoiselle Lifi a reviving drink. 

# Chapter 2: The Detective

## f. watch the stuffy-looking shrimp and g. bring Mademoiselle Lifi a reviving drink. 

Oh no! Poor Mr. Shramply. Someone had stolen his wall! Marbela felt awful for him. 

He didn't look upset, though. His gaze swept across the courtyard like he expected to find the missing wall somewhere in the crowd, munching on a mussel wrap and sipping a Marbelini. 

A buzz of confused worry sprang up among the gathered guests.

What could Marbela do? What should she do? Paisley was having an urgent, hushed conversation with Mayor Myrtle and the guard. Mr. Shramply had stepped down into the crowd and was trying to get Aria's attention. 

Everyone seemed to be ignoring Mademoiselle Lifi, who drifted, limp as seaweed, jewelry occasionally clanking in the current. 

Maybe someone should bring her a refreshing drink. 

Marbela grabbed her ingredients from their box beneath the catering station and quickly mixed a Marbelini. 

The crowd was getting loud. Marbela heard Cyrus's name at least once and Aria's twice on her way to Mademoiselle Lifi, but she was too busy avoiding spilling the Marbelini to listen. She dodged herring art students, pushed her way past the be-hatted starfish, and emerged from the crowd. 

Mademoiselle Lifi still floated, limp as before. One of her fronds was draped, seemingly accidentally but extremely artistically, above her face. Beneath the frond, her eyes were open and sharp. She was *pretending* to be passed out. 

### What should Marbela do?

a. Ignore it. Offer her the drink and express hope that she'll feel better soon.

b. Turn and follow her gaze. Try to spot what she's looking at. 

c. Say "did you see who did it?"

d. Say, "oh gosh, I'm glad you're feeling better! I thought you'd passed out."

## b. Turn and follow her gaze. Try to spot what she's looking at. 

Marbela followed Mademoiselle Lifi's gaze to Mr. Shramply, who appeared to be having an increasingly heated conversation with Aria. 

She glanced back. Mademoiselle Lifi's eyes were closed now. 

"I brought you a drink." Marbela held out the Marbelini hopefully.  

Mademoiselle Lifi cracked an eye open, then snatched the drink and took a quick gulp. "It is not alcoholic. Where is the alcohol?"

A little ripple of disappointment ran down Marbela's arms. She'd hoped for a more positive response. "It's for all ages." Plus Paisley's catering business didn't have an alcohol license. 

"Hmmph." Mademoiselle Lifi held up the glass, inspecting the contents, then inspected Marbela through the contents. "What is your part in all this? Did you steal my mural? Did you not think it was sufficiently flattering for your ancestor?"


## How does Marbela react? 

a. With bafflement. She's a caterer. Why would she steal a mural? She's not even related to Augusta, as far as she knows. 

b. With offense. She brought Lifi a drink and Lifi accused her of stealing the mural. Plus, why do people always assume all octopuses are related? 

c. With polite customer service mode. She's just the caterer, and she wasn't involved in the mural, but she hopes Lifi gets her mural back. 

d. With logic. How the heck does Lifi think she stole the mural? She doesn't own a construction service. And she doesn't even know what the mural was supposed to depict. 


> [!NOTE] Title
> I love how you created the imagery of her arms rippling with disappointment. It makes my mind feel the picture. Good job Liz

# A mixture between a and d!

"Why would I steal your mural?" Marbela was baffled. "My apartment already *has* walls."

Mademoiselle Lifi lowered the glass and squinted at Marbela, a glint in her eye like she thought she'd caught Marbela in a lie. "You could be building a second apartment."

"But there's only one of me."

With a quick flip of her fins, Mademoiselle Lifi tossed half of the Marbelini back. "Then you stole it for revenge."

This was getting more and more confusing. "I didn't steal it for revenge."

"Then why did you steal it?"

"I didn't steal it at all!" Marbela waved her arms, distressed. "I couldn't steal it! I can't steal an entire wall! I'd need a—a forklift, or something. I'm a catering assistant! I don't even own the van, it's Paisley's!" She saw the glint in Mademoiselle Lifi's eyes again and hurried to catch up. "And before you ask, Paisley didn't steal it either! And neither of us are related to Octavia."

Wait. Was that true? Marbela wasn't related to to Octavia, at least not any more than any random two octopuses were related to each other, as far as she knew. She *was* related to Paisley; they were fourth cousins. But that didn't mean Paisley couldn't be related to Octavia. 

Could Paisley have stolen the mural? 


### What does Marbela think?

a. ....maybe?

b. No, that's ridiculous. Paisley? An art thief? 

c. Possibly, but she really really hopes not. 

d. Oh man. Maybe she'd better try to check the van for evidence. 

e. Oh no. Maybe she's better try to check the van for evidence...and hide it if there is any.

f. Even if Paisley's related to Octavia, there's no reason for her to have stolen the mural.


# e. Oh no. Maybe she's better try to check the van for evidence...and hide it if there is any.

Marbela's head spun. Mademoiselle Lifi receded along with the courtyard's din, leaving Marbela alone with nothing to keep her company but the increasingly insistent thought that maybe Paisley really had stolen the mural. 

Paisley had been extra grouchy and distant recently. Marbela had thought she was just working too late and not getting enough sleep, but maybe she was mixed up in something. Like art theft. 

She'd known Paisley since they'd both been kids together. Paisley was like an older sister to her. A grumpy, reticent older sister, but still. This was awful. 

"You look unwell." The glint in Mademoiselle Lifi's eye was that of a hunter who'd spotted her prey. "Is something wrong with this 'Paisley'?"

"No!" Marbela felt her skin trying to shift colors, to give away the lie. Her stomach was complaining about the spiced anemone she'd nibbled on while setting up and her arms were twitchy. "Excuse me." She grabbed the mostly-empty Marbelini glass and fled. 

Back through the buzzing, gossiping crowd. Back to the catering station. Back to the van. 

She cracked open the back door, the sound of the latch barely audible over her hearts' tandem drumroll. 

Paisley had loaded the van that morning. Marbela had met her at the courtyard and helped her unload it. She would have noticed if there had been a stolen, mural-covered wall in there. Right?

The back of the van held two extra crates of paper goods, a first-aid kit,  and nothing else. Nothing but a few crumpled pieces of paper.  

Marbela picked one up and smoothed it out. 

It was a parking ticket dated 2am that morning. When Paisley should have been in bed, sleeping, with her van legally parked outside. 

She picked up another paper, and a third. Both parking tickets. One was from two weeks ago and one was from last week and all of them were in the middle of the night. 

A sound behind her made her jump. She turned, whipping the papers out of sight. 

"Can I have my drink now?" It was the manatee kid, looking less bored than usual. "And a snack too? They're calling in Detective Inspector Holmes and we're all supposed to stay here and it might take hours." He frowned at her. "Why are you trying to hide parking tickets behind your back?"

## What's Marbela's hasty response?

a. "What parking tickets?"

b. "They're not things kids are supposed to see!"

c. "They're not mine!"

d. "Never mind the parking tickets, they're calling in who?"

e. "They're not parking tickets."

f. "I don't want anybody to get in trouble."
