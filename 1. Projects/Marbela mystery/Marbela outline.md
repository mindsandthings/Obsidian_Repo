# Chapter 1
At the opening of a mural at the Augusta Puzzle Museum, the mural and the wall that it's on are found missing.

## Scene 1
Marbela tries to get a kindergartner to try her invention, the Marbelini, and review it on Kelp. 

Goal: get someone to try her invention, the Marbellini
Motivation: impress someone and get a good Kelp review
Conflict: no one is interested
Stakes: her employer will think it was a waste of money

How the story moves forward: Marbela approaches a starfish (which is too busy and important), an unhelpful blobfish who doesn't like it at all, and a school of fish, but each one isn't interested. Finally, one of Myrtle's precocious students (who is reading a mystery book) says he'll give it a try, but she'll have to bribe him with other food. He does and is surprised that it's good even though it looks awful. She asks him to review her on Kelp but he's not old enough to have a phone...but he's willing to ask his brother to post a review for him, for a price. The price is that Marbela has to make something interesting happen. Then the ceremony is starting. Myrtle gives a speech about the August puzzle museum and the art program and the artist (a local grad) and the artist's portrayal of historical events surrounding Augusta's role in town history...and pulls back the curtain...and the wall is missing. The student says okay, that's a start.


Marbela's reaction:
a. Defensive: I didn't do it!
b. Shock: oh no! why would someone do that to the museum?? 
c. Worried and sympathetic: poor artist! I'd better make sure he's okay. 
d. Problem-solving: oh gosh. we have to find it!
