**Writing
Cozy story structure – Murder and Merlot**
Target 40,000 words first draft.
**Pre-writing.**
I want to write the back cover blurb – this is a high level view of the story and set-up. Just a few sentences to describe the story.
For a simple outline for the story. I have to know

- who the sleuth is
- who the sidekicks and friends are
- who the victim is, or the first victim, but this is a short mystery so not a lot of room for more than 2 murder investigations.
- potential motives for the killing.
- murder methods/weapons etc from brainstorming sessions.
- The setting and story world.

**WHO is the Sleuth?**

|     |     |

Her boyfriend Daniel was very supportive and used to come and stay every weekend at first, until things become difficult and she was working full-time in the deli and not on her career as a journalist.<br>He left her to start a relationship with her friend and flatmate Emma, so Lottie lost her boyfriend and her friend just when she needed them.<br>Her friends in Kingsmede have become her extended family rather than the grandparents and mother. She loves them but they decided to walk away when she needed help. |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Who is the first victim? | Simon Fraser |
| Does the heroine know the victim – this gives her a reason to get involved and care about why this murder happened | Lottie is making the buffet at the wine festival held at his luxurious estate. She knows the Fitzpatrick family but it was the wine growers society who organised the food. |
| Let heroine see interaction between victim and suspect before the murder. | Simon is arguing with Roger Fitzpatrick before the award ceremony begins. He is the father of her pal Amy who has come back from France for a few weeks over the summer. Amy drags him away and Margot drags Simon away. |

| Is there any special knowledge required which will lead them to the killer? Who has the means to carry this out. Who had access to the victim at the time of the murder? Means. Motive. Opportunity, | Since Lottie was the one who made the food she becomes the prime suspect for the peanut contamination.<br>But none of her food has nuts – the plate was deliberely tampered with.<br>But if she did not do it, who did?<br>Who served the trays of canapes?<br>Who had access? Staff. Customers. Guests. Anyone who came through the kitchen. |

**STORY STRUCTURE**
Any cozy mystery book has obligatory scenes and a recognisable story structure, just as romance fiction.
Readers expect to see a traditional pattern of events, clues and reveals, setbacks and dead ends, leading to a climax final confrontation between the sleuth and the real killer.
I start by breaking the storyline down into 4 Acts.
Then each Act has 3 chapters, so I start with an outline broken down into 12 chapers. Each chapter is a sequence of scenes.
By the end of the project, I know that this could completely change, but it is somewhere to start.
Right now, at this point in story development, all I have is:

- an idea for the start of the story and the story situation/setting
- who my sleuth is
- who her friends are,
- who the first victim is, the means of death

Now I am going to dive into the beginning of the book and let the characters reveal more about themselves and the crime.
**Act One**
**Characters and world building.**

- Introduction of the main characters.
- Start with the sleuth to tell the reader that this is the person they are going to identify with. Let the reader know in the first scene/first chapter who the main character is and why they should care what happens to them.
- HOOK the reader in the first paragraph by hinting at a turning point or crisis in her life. Start with action or dialogue to draw the readers into the story.
- Bring in secondary characters.
- SHOW that she is skilled and has talents and strengths and can handle herself.
- Scene where future victim interacts with suspect – or show the body.
- Introduce the crime/murder and the cast of characters.
- Let the readers know that these people are all harbouring secrets.
- Introduce One Witness and One suspect.
- THEN put those likeable characters at risk. Make the Stakes REAL for the sleuth – what does she stand to lose if she does not find the killer?

So this sequence of scenes has to do a lot of heavy lifting.
This is my first draft so I am not worried about making each word perfect. This is getting the story down and the characters onto the page, acting and reacting and revealing more about themselves.
By the end of Act One, I should have clear signposts about where this story is going and how I am going to get there.
Tomorrow I shall be working on the publishing and marketing tasks. See you then!
Now back to the writing.

Until then – have a great day! Nina
