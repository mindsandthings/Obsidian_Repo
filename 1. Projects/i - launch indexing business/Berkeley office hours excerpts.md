Sylvia Coates : Jennifer, the completion rate for the old USDA  
course was 27%. And most of the graduate couldn't index and didn't become  
working indexers. I just learned a few weeks ago from the head of the ASI  
course committee that the ASI course has an 11% completion rate. The  
Berkeley course completion rate has been between 80-90% for years.

Sylvia Coates : The truth is that a natural thematic thinker,  
which is rare in adults, is going to have an easier time learning to  
index. It will always be easier for them. But people who are aware of the  
thematic vs. classification thinking process can train themselves to be  
very competent indexers.

Sylvia Coates: The Macrex interface is just awful but the reason we include it in the course is  
because once you master the learning curve it allows indexers to index faster than on either Cindex or  
SKY.

Sylvia Coates: That said, I considering indexing to be a dream job for about 28 years and it is only  
recently that my priorities have started to change.

Deborah Evans-Cantrell: Fred, I just completed the first indexing project (in module 5) and was wondering about grading. Is there an average of how students generally do on  each of the three indexing projects as they progress in their skill level? I’m sure it all depends on the student, so it may be a tough one to answer.  
Fred Leise: In my experience, most students get better as they progress through the  course, but some find the final index problematic and come a cropper, as the British  say.  
Fred Leise: But I’d say many students get a high C or low B for their first index.
