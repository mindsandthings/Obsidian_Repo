I got a weeks' subscription to the Lit Market place and bookmarked A LOT of publshing houses websites.....created a spreadsheet and an 'elevator speech' sort of email and started cold emailing

I've contacted over 100 publishing houses and university presses. have heard back from maybe 10 so far.

most were 'thanks for reaching out but no thank you' but at least I heard back? A few said they'd add me to their list of freelancers they do use for future work

i also got some great feed back from the 2 practice indexes i've been working on, so i'm continuing working on those and finally working on my website.

Being put on a list is great! Even if it takes a long time before they call on you, they eventually may contact you for a job.

==Whenever I was put on a list, I would contact the publisher every 6 months or so to say "I've recently had a project slip and find that I have time available to accept another project. Do you happen to have anything available?" 9 times out of 10 I would get a project.


==Regarding my previous piece of advice. I think it is best to never sound desperate for work. That tends to make editors uncomfortable. They want to work with indexers who are in demand.

One indirect way of marketing yourself is to actively participate on the indexing discussion lists. Other indexers get to "know" you a little bit and may feel comfortable passing you along extra work they have.
