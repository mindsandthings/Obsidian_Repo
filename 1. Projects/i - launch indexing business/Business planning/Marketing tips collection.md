Hi Kim,

I never labeled myself a "new" indexer nor "old" nor "experienced" indexer but rather just an "indexer" available for indexing projects.

In the beginning, I indexed a few books without indexes and used these for samples of my indexes, if asked.

Best, and stay well,

Naomi

    Hi all. I finished the Berkeley course in the spring and have created a couple of practice indexes (which I put up on the index peer review a few days ago) from books I have. 

    It's time I started looking for paying work. If there is anyone out there who subcontracts and who is willing to work with a newbie please contact me. 
    Also does anyone know of indie publishers or authors who are known to use new indexers? I've bookmarked a few but haven't contacted yet. 

    Thanks for any advice and your time!

Kim, I am in the same boat as you. 

Experienced indexers -- are there any best practices for cold emailing, like subject lines to avoid or ones that will capture a publisher's attention? Keep the email short and sweet or detailed? 

Thank you for your wisdom. Excited!

I used Sue Klefstad Indexing Services (my company name) as the subject line.
My email opened with some statement(s) specific to the company, to let them know I'd checked out their website.
I had some very small boilerplate chunk about me (experience in the publishing field) then I directed them to my website.

Short. Easy to file and re-find.

All the best to you!

Yes, Naomi, I also like to focus on making the link between a publishers work overall, maybe even specific forthcoming books, and my interests and specialties.  It makes it clearer why I am contacting them, how I can help them thus makes marketing more comfortable and interesting for me. I like to think that everyone wins when an indexer suited to the project does the work, and I am helping them find that by contacting them.

Good luck everyone!

Yes to sending out cold emails. That's how I've gotten most of my work.

First you need to find publishing companies to send them to. Publisher's associations are a good source. Look at their membership lists. Check out each publisher's website and see what sort of work they publish. Is it the sort of work you'd like to index? If there are particular subject areas they publish in that you'd particularly like to work with, it doesn't hurt to mention it in the email. It will make it look more personal, less like you just spammed every publisher you could find.

If you can, try to find out who the Production or Managing Editor is. That's usually who you want to email. If that info isn't on the website, try phoning. Tell them you're a freelance indexer looking for work and ask who you should send your resume to.

When you send your email, attach a resume and a sample of your work. When you're brand new and you haven't done any paid work yet, it's fine to list your school projects, volunteer indexing and whatever else you've done.

You may want to pay special attention to university presses and publishers of textbooks. It's easier to break in with these types of publishers.

Maybe I just got lucky, but I sent out maybe a dozen cold emails before I landed my first paid project.
