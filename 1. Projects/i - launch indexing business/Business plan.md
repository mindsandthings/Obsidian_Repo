# Focus

Indexing. Possibly adding copyediting and developmental editing later. Continue focusing on nonfiction.

Right now I think back-of-the-book indexing.

Series bibles?

\[Check the accidental indexer for what other people tend to offer.\]

# Training

This section will need updating as I figure out who my potential clients are and what they want.

## Indexing

Currently taking the ASI Module A indexing course. Have some concerns about Module B based on what I'm hearing. Unsure whether to ignore sunk costs and start the Berkeley course (which requires purchasing Windows), or keep going.

I want to look into taxonomy and controlled vocabulary training - who employs these people?

Also, ongoing training.

- If I decide to do copyediting too, I will need to do another course (potentially UCSD or UW).
    
    It would be good to get a mentor, possibly later.
    

Freelancing vs independent contracting?

Sole proprietorship vs LLC

All the material required for the exams is contained in the module documents, quizzes, and exercises.
However, students are encouraged to begin assembling their indexing reference libraries by the time they begin Module B. Useful texts are *Indexing Books*, 2nd edition, by Nancy Mulvany, and *Ten Characteristics of Quality Indexes* by Margie Towery, and especially the indexing chapter of *The Chicago Manual of Style*, 17th edition, which may be purchased as an ebook or paperback book [here](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo27527533.html).
By the time they start Module C, some students find the conceptual approach to indexing in *Facing the Text: Content and Structure in Book Indexing* by Do Mi Stauber, Cedar Row Press, 2004, to be very helpful.

## Mentorship

# Client Focus

I'm not sure how to narrow this down, and need to figure it out. Reread the Accidental Indexer book.

What does disability publishing look like?

Potentially academics, though it's been a long time.

Potentially series bibles.

**In your business plan, compile a list of all the clients you are going to contact.** They should be relevant to your background and experience. Note the name of the organization, the types of material it publishes, and the name of the person to contact. Make a quick phone call if you don’t know the name of the person in charge of commissioning editorial services. My initial list had over 70 entries. Take time to research each client, even if there are lots of them. Make a note in your business plan of their specialist areas so that you can customize your contact message. Round-

# Getting Experience

5.2 Gratis work Another method is to offer to carry out a few free pieces of work for your target client groups. For example: ~ Small, independent publishers who can’t afford to contract out work to freelance copy-editors/proofreaders are a useful avenue to explore in order to garner experience. ~ You could offer to proofread a student thesis for free on a one-off basis by making contact with someone at your local university – perhaps via a competition. ~ Is there a local/parish magazine that you could offer to edit for a set period of time, at no cost? ~ Do you have friends who regularly write expansive business reports that you could offer to proofread? ~ Might you search online for Google+ hangouts where aspiring authors look for help at a token price? ~ Are there social networking sites that you can explore where you might pick up a few leads? ~ Can you make contact with a local business and offer to do gratis work on their website or some printed reports? ~ Is there a local charity whose aims you support and which might be grateful for some proofreading help?

~ It’s not about the money at the beginning – it’s about planning how you will acquire experience in a particular field and a strong reference to sell on to other clients. ~ Don’t forget, when you come to executing this part of your business plan, to ask politely for a testimonial. Don’t be shy about this – it’s perfectly acceptable business practice. ~ At the planning stage, the aim is to draw up a working list of targets whose praise will speak to the sector of the market you want to focus on – the kind of people whose recommendations will be recognized by your future clients. So if you’re thinking about targeting publishers, you want testimonials from the same; if you’re planning on working with independent authors, then references from satisfied writers will work well.
