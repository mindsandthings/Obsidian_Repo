Honing pitch to specific publisher before phoning them. You should be able to pinpoint the specific person you need to talk to.

Literary Marketplace - most libraries have and you can get online, for looking up publishers' subject areas. Can sign in for limited use for free or sign in for a week and get a lot of info. Might be acquisitions editor or managing editor or person in charge of freelancing; she prefers managing editor or lead production editor.

Publishers may have info on rates; authors are willing to negotiate.

What do I think it will take to get a decent hourly rate? What is a decent hourly rate?

Negotiating very difficult; have to harden heart

Get someone to help you with taxes

You can contact secretaries in university departments

She fires clients by saying she's busy until they drift away. Some people are more direct about it.

She does not think the market is saturated because she turns down a lot of jobs. That is a discussion that's going on right now.

Hi Kim,

I never labeled myself a "new" indexer nor "old" nor "experienced" indexer but rather just an "indexer" available for indexing projects.

In the beginning, I indexed a few books without indexes and used these for samples of my indexes, if asked.

Best, and stay well,

Naomi

Kim, I am in the same boat as you. 

Experienced indexers -- are there any best practices for cold emailing, like subject lines to avoid or ones that will capture a publisher's attention? Keep the email short and sweet or detailed? 

Thank you for your wisdom. Excited!

I used Sue Klefstad Indexing Services (my company name) as the subject line.
My email opened with some statement(s) specific to the company, to let them know I'd checked out their website.
I had some very small boilerplate chunk about me (experience in the publishing field) then I directed them to my website.

Short. Easy to file and re-find.

All the best to you!

Yes, Naomi, I also like to focus on making the link between a publishers work overall, maybe even specific forthcoming books, and my interests and specialties.  It makes it clearer why I am contacting them, how I can help them thus makes marketing more comfortable and interesting for me. I like to think that everyone wins when an indexer suited to the project does the work, and I am helping them find that by contacting them.

Good luck everyone!

Yes to sending out cold emails. That's how I've gotten most of my work.

First you need to find publishing companies to send them to. Publisher's associations are a good source. Look at their membership lists. Check out each publisher's website and see what sort of work they publish. Is it the sort of work you'd like to index? If there are particular subject areas they publish in that you'd particularly like to work with, it doesn't hurt to mention it in the email. It will make it look more personal, less like you just spammed every publisher you could find.

If you can, try to find out who the Production or Managing Editor is. That's usually who you want to email. If that info isn't on the website, try phoning. Tell them you're a freelance indexer looking for work and ask who you should send your resume to.

When you send your email, attach a resume and a sample of your work. When you're brand new and you haven't done any paid work yet, it's fine to list your school projects, volunteer indexing and whatever else you've done.

You may want to pay special attention to university presses and publishers of textbooks. It's easier to break in with these types of publishers.

Maybe I just got lucky, but I sent out maybe a dozen cold emails before I landed my first paid project.

# Misc indexing marketing notes
I've had pretty good experiences with Westchester. They usually pay $3.75 per indexable page, and sometimes will refer me to authors and I can negotiate the price directly with the author. I also find their editing and proofs to generally be of high quality. Not sure why the difference between Westchester and other packagers. Maybe because Westchester is based in the US (I think)? Though I understand too that Westchester needs their cut and so prices are lower than what you can get negotiating directly with an author.

There are also packagers and packagers. The "good" ones I just

mentioned---Stephen's sounds like one---would be true _prepress

service providers_, which were around for a long time before the name

"packager" started to be used, and whose business it is to serve

publishers. OTOH a lot of "packagers" these days are more accurately

\_self-publishers\_ or \_distributors\_, who target wannabe authors or

small-fry organizations with content, and focus on production and

marketing. Building a stable for oneself of acceptable clients may

involve sussing out, in particular cases, what kind of outfit you're

dealing with (or which way it leans).

Another possibility is to check Cengage, Macmillan, SPI, Integra and Newgen. These are all located in India. Because some of them don’t pay well, more established indexers will sometimes reject projects from them, and I have seen them advertise that they are looking for new indexers. I certainly don’t think any indexer should have to work for starvation wages, but it wouldn’t hurt to do one or two at a cheaper rate, just so you can compile a list of projects and satisfied clients. In my publishing Webinar, spoke about the need to reach out to self publishing platforms to find authors who are looking for indexers. If they have discussion groups, you can post your services for free. Self-publishing used to be an orphan child in the indexing world, but that just isn’t true any more. I had one author hire me several years ago when he was self-publishing. He really liked what I did, and has referred me to other authors.

I'm not sure what your areas of expertise are, but hybrid publishers are a new type of publishers that have emerged in the last few years. Think professional quality, acquisitions, and distribution, but with the author owning the copyright and paying for production. They don't often show up on lists of publishers, but they should, I think. The best ones are essentially publishers who happen to have a different business model.

I signed up to work with a career coach. This was a huge step for me, and I didn't learn about coaching until 2015, so I had a few years of indexing under my belt already. The help I have gotten from a career coach who has decades of experience in publishing opened up a lot of opportunities and a whole different approach to marketing. I have gotten several lucrative projects directly due to the insights I gained from working with a coach.

Hi Kerstin,

I'm a big believer in cold emailing as opposed to cold calling.

Email fits into the workflow of a packager or editor. It can be dealt with at their convenience and easily filed then found again.

When I was a packager, I didn't have a place to put paper products sent to me. I also didn't have my own phone, which is probably unusual. But phone calls only meant trouble to me (because everyone emailed everything but trouble) and interrupted whatever I was doing.

It has worked well for me to send a concise email (I'm an indexer, after all) with a good subject line and a link to my website.


Mentoring and New Indexers: 
https://idg.groups.io/g/main/topic/21225774#36350
"I agree with Sylvia that most experienced indexers are too busy. Most indexers are scrambling to get out work so they can make a living and pay the bills—and training someone new would be a major impact."

Simple Truth #1: If you don't make use of every tool available for getting your name out there, you'll starve.


Even with constant marketing, be ready for a lot of discouragement. In my case, I marketed myself for over a year before I got my first job. When I got that offer I was so discouraged I was ready to quit. Don't get discouraged, keep plugging away and market, market, market.


Simple Truth #2: Clients are leery of hiring an indexer without a track record, you have to do everything you can to alleviate their apprehensions.


With those two truths in mind here are my recommendations for new indexers.


1. Create a LinkedIn page: This is probably the single most important thing you can do. Most people don't have very effective LinkedIn pages, but there are tutorials showing how to build a good one. A lot of people consider their LinkedIn page (if they have one) as an afterthought. However you're dealing with professionals and the first place they'll look for information on you is LinkedIn. When I got my first job offer the editor specifically mentioned she'd looked me up on LinkedIn before making the offer. It's impossible to over stress how important this step is.

2. Create a web site: Make sure you have a "portfolio" page on the site so potential clients can see your work. When you're first starting out you won't have any paid jobs to display, but create some sample indexes and post them there. You must give a potential client something to look at. When you create a sample index, make sure you get it reviewed before posting. This increases the quality of the sample and enhances your education as an indexer.

3. Join your local indexing society: When you join, spend the money to be listed in the register of indexers maintained by the society. You need to appear when a potential client searches the register for an indexer. If the society has a mentorship program, make use of that as well, it will be money well spent. This starts you networking with other indexers and is a real leg up in your education.

4. Cold mailings: Either by physical letter or email (or both). Build lists of presses who publish works that fit your skill set and contact them. If you get offered a job that's outside your wheel house, take it. You're new and can't afford to be picky.

5. Peer Review: When you get a job, make use of the peer review group and have the draft index reviewed before you submit it. You will get constructive criticism that you can use to make the index better.

6. Talk with other indexers: Expand the circle of fellow professionals who know who you are. Email, video chats, news groups.


Is this a lot of work? Yes. Is it necessary? Yes, it's critical.


Simple Truth #3: If you don't market yourself and let clients know of your existence, no one else will. You're the only one who cares.


However, I assume Literary Marketplace is online so it would be a start.  Another possibility is to check Cengage, Macmillan, SPI, Integra and Newgen.  These are all located in India.  Because some of them don’t pay well, more established indexers will sometimes reject projects from them, and I have seen them advertise that they are looking for new indexers.

# Series bibles as future possibility
==Future possibility


Whether you are writing two or twenty books that are connected to one another, story continuity is important. It provides consistency and smooth transitions for the reader. Readers will notice when a character has blue eyes in the first book and brown eyes in the fourth. Authors have enough on their plates without trying to remember every detail or spending copious amounts of time searching earlier books for answers.

​

In creating a series bible, I keep track and organize the details in each book into an easy-to-follow document. I also provide a short synopsis for each chapter, creating a concise and accurate timeline. The specific categories in the bible are up to the author, but they often include: 

​

- main character biographies
    
- secondary character biographies
    
- background character biographies
    
- family tree
    
- locations and settings
    
- races, cultures, and societal norms
    
- rules/laws
    
- clothing and accessories
    

​

Biographies may include (but are not to limited to): full name, age, physical traits, birthday, parent and sibling names, location of birth, schooling, jobs, travels, friends, exes, hobbies, internal and external goals, secrets, goals, pet peeves, and any other backstory.

​

Since each bible is unique, they are completely customizable. It's truly about whatever is going to work best for the author.

​

Prices start at $350 per book.

​
