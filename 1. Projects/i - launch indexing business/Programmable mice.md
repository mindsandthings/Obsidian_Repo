[14:27] Sarahh Scher: Elena, I got a Razer mouse...and then found out it's not programmable with a Mac.
[14:28] Sarahh Scher: Hahahahaha. I do like the pretty colors. I will probably end up getting a Logitech one that can be programmed in Mac.
[14:28] Matthew MacLellan: There are also other programmable mice. Ploopy makes a trackball mouse, but you need to assemble it yourself. It's coded in the QMK environment, which people also use to program their keyboards.
