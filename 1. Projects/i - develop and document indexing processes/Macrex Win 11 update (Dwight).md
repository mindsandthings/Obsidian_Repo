To stop MACREX layout going crazy with Windows 11 update:  
  
1) go to settings on top of console window when MACREX is opened with  
crazy layout  
2) choose startup with 'Windows console'  
3) save  
4) close MACREX  
5) open MACREX - all OK now.  
  
Windows terminal was causing problem so opening with Windows console will  
make it revert back to old system console not new terminal.
