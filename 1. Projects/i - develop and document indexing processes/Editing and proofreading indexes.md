# Talking with publisher


1.  Are main headings or only proper nouns to be capitalized?
2.  What is the cross-reference format?
3.  What is the page locator format?
4.  How will display material (tables, illustrations, photographs, maps, figures) be treated?
5.  How will footnotes or endnotes be designated in the index?
6.  Consider subheading levels -- will there be one level of subheadings or two levels, using sub-subheadings?
7.  What sorting order will be used: letter-by-letter or word-by-word?
8.  What index structure format will be used: run-in, indented, or blended style?
9.  Will there be a letter heading or extra space between alphabetic groups in the index?
10.  How much space is available for the index? Are there any space limitations that the indexer needs to be aware of for the project? (We'll discuss this important issue in a later module.)
11.  Are there any other special considerations for the index? For example: British or U.S. English spelling and punctuation? Special formatting of any kind (author names, titles, definitions in bold, diacritics)? What will be the treatment of function words in main headings: are they to be ignored in the sort or inverted?
    
    _A Tale of Two Cities_ (Dickens)  
    _Tale of Two Cities, A_ (Dickens)
    
12.  Delivery of index: is e-mail attachment of an RTF file expected? If not, what type of file does the editor require? Are there any special coding requirements for the file, including any for diacritics (accent marks)?



### Before You Begin

Check the publisher's style sheet and confirm: 
-   Alphabetization: letter-by-letter or word-by-word
-   Capitalization: initial letter of common noun capitalized or not
-   Locators: elided or full page range (124-26 or 124-126)
-   Notes: form of notes (126n7)
-   Illustrations, tables, and figures: form of locators
-   Cross-reference format and placement
-   Format of index: run-in style, indented style

### While Indexing

1. Identify the metatopic(s) of the document.
2. Keep track of info for an introductory note. 
2. For each chunk of text: 
	who
	what
	where
	why (pertinent subtopic info)
	when (less likely to be a main heading)
	under what circumstances (pertinent subtopic info)
e.g., what main heading may be followed by a who subentry; "who" main heading may be followed by a "what" subentry

1. Index subtopics under the main topic, and as their own main heading
2. Doublecheck the locator when entering the entry

1. Write an entry
	1. Is the keyword the first word? 
	2. Will readers look for it there? 
	3. Does it need an inversion with a *See*?
	4. Where else might readers look for it? Create *See* entries instead of doubleposting. 
2. Main headings are primary access points for readers. Subheadings present related aspects of the main headings broken down for easier access by the reader.

What is this about? Am I catching the named themes and relationships? Are there implicit themes/relationships I'm missing? 

Omit "A", "an", and "the" whenever possible incl from subheadings

Parallel construction
Grammatical relationships without inversions and with the keyword first
Noun or noun phrase
Avoid inversions when possible
Avoid articles, prepositions, and conjunctions when possible (include only when necessary for meaning)
Do not make the main heading an adjective in subentry construction (e.g., not "hair: color")
Reflect the author's terms
Avoid overanalysis (a subheading or two for every locator)

-   All of the main topics are listed in the index as main headings.

-   The information relating to those main headings is broken down for the convenience of the reader.

-   The double-posted entries, both main headings and subheadings, consistently list the same page references.

-   The same information is listed, and accessible to the reader, at multiple access points.

Do the themes express the meaning within the content of the text? 


1.  What is the _purpose_ (or function) of the text?
2.  Who will the _readers_ (or audience) be for this text?
3.  What is the _author's agenda_?
4.  How do the above answers affect the _indexing approach_?
5.  What are the typical _indexing specifications_ for this kind of text? (More questions to ask regarding indexing specifications will be outlined in Topic 4.3.)
6.  What is the _production time_? Production time is defined as the time line during which the text manuscript is copyedited, revised, proofed, designed, and otherwise prepared for publication. This time line does not include the amount of time it takes for the author to write the original manuscript.




Once you have started, pay attention to structural issues that may develop in your index.

-   Coverage of both general and specific topics
-   Metatopic overload (Are you lumping too much under the overall subject of the book?)
-   Completeness and comprehensiveness of main headings
-   Multiple access points for the same term -- double-posting page numbers accurately
-   Cross-references to move users around the index

#### Main Heading Issues

-   Broad main headings with too many subheadings: break them down into more-specific main headings.
-   Closely related main headings: combine main headings into one main heading.
-   Main headings needing distinctions in meaning: use more than one main heading, not one general heading for all.
-   Wording: use nouns, adjectives + nouns, gerunds, or noun phrases.

#### Subheading Issues

-   Subheadings that have too many locators: break out a subheading into a main heading and link it to the original main heading with a cross-reference.
-   Combine or delete subheadings if there are too many subheadings for the number of pages.
-   Wording: make your wording concise, using keyword access.
-   Sub-subheadings: avoid these if possible, but use with biography, medical, and legal materials.

#### Cross-Reference Issues

Cross-references must match the main heading exactly. Add any additional cross-references that are needed. Avoid the following:

-   Blind references
-   Circular cross references
-   Convoluted references leading to another _See_ references rather than directly to a main heading

#### Double-Posting Issues

Double-posting refers to the use of the same term or concept in different positions in the index (as main heading, as subheading, as acronym). These double-postings must be consistent. A thorough double-postings check also provides a way to look at the index in a different way. Use group mode on main headings and other concepts to find all instances of them within the index. Check these types of headings for consistent page numbers:

-   Direct flipping of main headings and subheadings
-   Subheading as a separate main heading
-   Foreign language terms and translations of foreign language terms
-   Acronyms/abbreviations and full form of name
-   Synonyms with few page numbers

#### General Editorial Issues to Keep an Eye On as You Go

While you're indexing, use the spell-check feature, and keep the following problem areas in mind:

-   Consistency in hyphenated words
-   Name-place organization starting with the same word
-   Proper names: check as you go
-   Inappropriate use of boldface or italic font
-   Parentheses and quotation mark sets
-   Spaces in wrong places
-   Consistency in spelling and capitalization
-   Locators that are obviously wrong -- large numbers, individual locators that should be combined in a page range (79, 79-81, 80)

### Final editing

When you are ready for the final edit and proofing process, allow some time for editorial distance. Start fresh in the morning or after lunch. You will need to counteract the "glaze-over factor" that comes from being involved with the material for several days or weeks. 

Separate pass-throughs for editing and proofreading are helpful, so you don't have to look for everything in one pass. Below is a suggested list of issues to concentrate on in separate passes.

-   Undifferentiated page numbers and synonymous main headings
-   Locators that are obviously wrong
-   Main headings with lots of subheadings and wording of subheadings
-   Double-postings of concepts, synonyms, and abbreviations/acronyms
-   Cross-reference accuracy



### Final checklist

Introductory note

Recheck RTF against specs

Check for >5 locators

Convert *See* entries to doubleposts as appropriate

Check for parallel construction

Main headings must be nouns or noun phrases

Check for orphaned subheadings

Refine terms for main headings

Check the metatopic entry

Check RTF formatting - make it super plain

In editing: 

1. Refine the terms for main headings and prepare suitable cross-references
2. Decide what to treat as a main entry vs sub-entry: where will readers look first? 
3. If main headings have too many locators, break them up into subentries. 
4. Subheadings should be concise and informative as possible and begin with a keyword, and omit articles whenever possible. 
5. Check to ensure all cross-references match the edited headings.

#### CMOS Index Editing Checklist

Index- editing checklist. Editing an index requires some or all of the following steps, not necessarily in the order given here. Note that it is not  necessary to check every heading and every locator against the work—  which would take forever— but it is necessary to read the index carefully  and to refer to the latest version of the page proofs from time to time.  

1. Check headings— in both the main entries and subentries— for alphabetical  order.  
2. Check the spelling, capitalization, and font (i.e., italics or roman) of each  heading, consulting the page proofs if in doubt. 
3. Check punctuation— commas, colons, semicolons, en dashes, etc.— for proper  style and consistency (see 16.94– 100).  
4. Check cross- references to make sure they go somewhere and that headings  match (see 16.21). Make sure they are needed; if only a few locators are involved, substitute these for the see reference (see 16.16). Ensure that the placement of all cross- references within entries is consistent.  
5. Add cross- references you believe are necessary.  
6. Check to make sure there are no false locators such as “193– 93” or “12102”  (and figure out whether these may be the product of a typo) and make sure the  locators to each main heading and subheading are in ascending order.  
7. Check subentries for consistency of order, whether alphabetical or chronological. See 16.68– 70.  
8. If some entries seem overanalyzed (many subentries with only one locator  or, worse, with the same locator), try to combine some of them if it can be  done without sacrificing their usefulness. If subheadings are more elaborately  worded than necessary, try to simplify them.  
9. If awkward or unnecessary sub- subentries appear, correct them by adding appropriate repeated subentries or by adjusting punctuation (see 16.27, 16.28).  
10. Look for long strings of unanalyzed locators and break them up, if possible,  with subentries (see 16.10, 16.129).  
11. Evaluate the accuracy of locators by a random check of five to ten entries. If  more than one error shows up, consult the author or the indexer; every locator  may have to be rechecked.  
12. If the index needs trimming, delete any entries (and cross- references thereto) that you know from your work on the book are trivial, such as references to  persons or places used only as examples of something. But be careful. You may offend someone or let yourself in for a lot of work. A handful of unnecessary  entries, if they are very short, will not mar an otherwise good index.
