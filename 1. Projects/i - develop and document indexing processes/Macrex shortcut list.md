How to italicize in Macrex? 



Many users, instead of completely deleting entries, move them to the query section at the bottom of the index by adding a question mark to the beginning of the entry. This makes easy recovery
possible! The block delete function can be configured to send deleted entries to the query section.

The MBK is the working file. 

To load changes made in Word back into Macrex: 
1. Save the file
2. Reload it as a new file in Macrex using the R-Read a backup, renaming the file, then export to RTF again. 




Get to I/E with Ctrl-Q
Get to add with Ctrl-B
Alt-1: write to disk

To add numbers as the final characters in an entry heading: provide a hidden or non-printing character tag (such as ~!~) after it. F7 will insert this. Similarly if you have activated Roman numerals and are ending with something that looks like one. 

Macrex: if you see "ctd" (continued) press Alt-up-up to scroll up

When repeating a search, + moves forward through the index (down toward the end of the index) and - moves backwards (up toward the beginning of the index).

alt-comma to insert a comma

ctrl-home: go to beginning of index or ctrl-pagup, otherwise search and replace won't search the entire index

To get to PNO: from main menu, U. Note that if you back it up it will back it up to a .pno file. If you add new entries, each one must begin with an "a, " so that it's under the main heading. 

Ctrl-U-U to undelete

In a wildcard Search (or Group) operation, ? matches any single character, * matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character, and + matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character. There is a list of wildcards in the Glossary. Here are some examples. (Note: Not all of the example words below are in the TUTOR index.) ?ig would match wig, pig, digital, fig, design, high and thousands of other words including, as long as it weren’t the first word of the main heading, ignorant). The only requirement is that they have the letters “IG” and something – anything – before these two letters. b?*e would match bootie, bottle, Newberg, abuse, Beffa and publishing certificate. b+o would match books, bootie, bottle and bottom. b+o*t would match bootie, bottle and bottom. bo+o would match books and bootie.
