Connections are important but also very stressful. Other people sometimes react like I'm being presumptive if I try to find a connection. This one is also stressful because connections are what makes writing intensely difficult! I suspect I need some support here specifically for thatâ€”the combo of needing to get the connections right and difficulty keeping track of all them. Another issue is fitting associations together in a linear way.

I am so thoroughly cut off from other people that it's hard for me to see how this applies.

I don't know how to move forward on this. The explanations of connectedness don't really work well for me.

I do believe that most actions have reasons in the sense that they have causes. I can put connecteions into my writing and enjoy doing so.

Mostly this stregnth shows up when other people try to deny the effects of actions and convince e not to use responsibility.

I do not know what to do about this. Maybe my other strengths will help? I feel awful and I want help

# Aug 2022 areas of focus

Help others see connections and purpose in everyday life.

When you meet new people, ask them questions to find common ground and shared interests that you can use as a starting point.
