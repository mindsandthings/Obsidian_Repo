Futuristics:

when the future changes they have to grieve it as though they'd lost something because it feels like something they already had

you're enjoying the future before it happens and then when it happens you're in the future again

strategic changes futuristic, especially when strategic is dominant. When you live in a future you see it feels the same as the way you live today.

the balcony of futuristic has an easier time grieving the future and walking back when it doesn't happen.

futuristic just says "I don't know when/why/how but it will happen" and other strengths come into play for when/why/how, and that can make it a harder future to get

living in future can help escape from present pain

difficult in relationships because you feel like a cassandra

**you hit a wall and can't write beyond it if you haven't plotted and don't know what will happen**

what you do in the present is always affected by how you see the future happening

getting too attached to the "how" kills creativity

the definition of "now" is different when you have futuristic

a lot of people will say "don't worry about things that will never happen" but our anticipating it helps change it

common to accidentally anticipate trends

being aware so that you don't wind up creating something successful you don't want

checklists to make things easier on your future self

don't think about how much you want to make, think about how much you want to take home

don't get too attached to the how

ask yourself bigger questions or different questions or come at them from different angles

* Have to grieve a future like losing something you already have
* easy trend toward catastrophizing, especially when it pairs up with strategic
* what makes you comfortable about the way futuristic acts is being in the future on some level, living there
* "I have to know where I'm going because if I don't I struggle really hard"
* element of how I live in the present that is always affected by the future happening
* a lot of people tell futuristics to get their head out of the clouds and stop worrying about things that will never happen
