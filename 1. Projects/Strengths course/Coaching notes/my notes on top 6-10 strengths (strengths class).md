How to decide when to do it better and when to learn to compensate for weaknesses? 

How not to let everything take forever

How to convey that not all time-consuming things are maximizing, sometimes they're meeting basic necessities

"The best question a Maximizer can ask is: what does success look like, and can I get that from doing what I'm doing? Because it can be tempting to follow other people's metrics of success and try to replicate them in order to feel successful, but that's not a great long-term plan because if their metric doesn't meet your metric, then you'll never feel like you've quite accomplished what you set out to do. So, know your version of success."

# Futuristic

How do futuristics cope with current events? For example, I would love to do long-term future strategizing, but the future is one in which there is no normal and there's no stability or time to allow planning. 

# Connectedness

I don't have a "everything happens for a reason" in the sense of meaningfulness, I have it in the sense of causation

How to handle this diplomatically? Expressing connections seems to instantly offend others. 

How to mentally detangle from others? 

What's important:
-- who you partner with (connections matter)
-- sense of purpose for your writing: the importance of impact and clarifying what that impact will be
-- care for yourself; don't give yourself all away
-- are you putting enough of your Connectedness into your work? 

When I put Connectedness into my work, that's what people center in on to cut

# Individualization

How do people find jobs that respect the fact that they're individuals? 

How do people avoid letting one person influence them too much

Relator
Deliberative - this is the social wariness one that describes current me 100%
