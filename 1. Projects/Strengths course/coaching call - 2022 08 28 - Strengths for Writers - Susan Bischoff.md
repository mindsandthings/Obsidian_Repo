She has an ADHD/Asperger's daughter and a large orange-white cat named either Barnum or Bailey (the offscreen cat has the other name)

She said it was interesting that analytical wasn't in my 2009 top 10 because she heard a lot of it in what I was talking about

For next call, she says tell them the same issues and look at it from perspective of full 10 stregnths 

# Input 
Where to find writing advice focused using Input to write stronger, more enjoyable backstory/worldbuilding/exposition, as opposed to writing advice focused on keeping it as barebones as possible?

[didn't really ask her about this]


# Strategic - info mgt
I write slowly and have a poor memory. I need to develop an information tracking system that actively supports my ability to identify dependencies in worldbuilding, plot, and character arc for a given book—including tracking what's on the page, the underlying generative information that gives rise to what's on the page, and how fixed or flexible any of it is based on how many problems I'll create by changing it. 

*reverse outlines as you go 
indexing as I go
color-coding different categories that show up so I can see it from a higher level
look for writers patreons
look for academic stuff

*try reading through a book and summarizing what happened in each category after each scene or chapter - picking out the threads. Give yourself a set of questions for each chapter: what happened with character development, worldbuilding, plot? And if nothing happened you don't have to answer it. 

*try also same with nonfiction, to look for structures. 


# Learner/Responsibility/Input/Intellection - nonfiction
Once I know too much about a topic, I can no longer write nonfiction about it, because each concept lights up at least five associated concepts, each factual statement has multiple caveats, and there are no linear paths through the information anymore. By this point I also know the topic well enough to know the problems that simplifying concepts will cause. I've tried to pick out bite-sized, manageable chunks but still wind up unable to write anything concise, clear, and accurate in a cost-effective amount of time.
