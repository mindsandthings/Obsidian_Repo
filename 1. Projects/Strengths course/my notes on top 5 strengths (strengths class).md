Input:Learn about knowledge managementEvaluate different tools
Intellection: I often get stuck in walking through the same train of thought over and over because I can't step back, see the bigger picture, and cut the Gordian knot. When I think, I think through muddied, confused thoughts until I hit a "perfect thought baby". I don't know how to hit the simple thoughts on the first
I use Input and LearnerTension between strengths-for-coping (using Learner to keep motivation levels high, using Input to
All of the above:
As you live out your high Learner life this week, start to notice when you're staying in learning mode when you know you should be in producing mode. Are you taking too much time on classes, books, and websites, and not enough in your manuscript?


# Input:

## Barriers related to getting input:

- <ins>TOOLS: I don't have an info-storing system I'm happy with.</ins>
    - Need to ensure strict division of to-do and non-to-do stuff
    - Tagging systems get too cluttered to use effectively or are too visually distracting or require too much manual upkeep
- <ins>Purpose of input:</ins> Input can be a necessary distraction but also dysregulating/addictive, due to difficulty task-switching + rabbit hole haze. The overhead involved in saving info can also cancel out the distraction benefit gained. Consuming for distraction also means consuming faster than I can organize or assimilate.
    - **Think this through - decide what kind of learning/reading trip I'm on?**
    - \*\*maybe this is a good one for coaching? \*\*
- <ins>PROCESS: Taking in information creates too many problems</ins>: If I store something, it must be judicious and purposeful. Otherwise it risks creating a poorly-thought-out obligation or making my planning systems unusable. But preprocessing information to determine whether it should go into my system creates a huge overhead—either immediately, or (if I dump it all into an inbox) later.
    - Storing a note feels like creating an obligation to do something with that info.
    - Storing non-actionable info (or non-necessary to-do's) clutters my active space and can tank my ability to use my system. I need to be able to provide myself with clear direction at all times or I get stuck. If I store it as reference info, I must have a plan to use it.
    - I might feel something is interesting or important, but I don't know what I'm saving it FOR, and without that, I can't take it in without cluttering my system.
    - A lot of what I learn just isn't very reliable, and isn't worth saving. Especially as I've gotten older I've become less and less trusting of what's "known" to be true
    - **Figuring out what information overhead to take on at what stage of the process**
    - different kinds of reference info -
        - ==**need a better scheme for deciding what to take in and what has to happen to it and preventing it from either becoming an unnecessary cluttering obligation or getting memory holed**==
    - ******Need to read about theory of personal information management******
        - **read kindle samples**
- <ins>Motivational issues</ins>
    - I burn out on areas of interest every 1-5 years and then often can't stand to be around it anymore, which is demotivating because I know I'll no longer be able to put the information to good use (this is probably primarily due to knowing too much and to social influences, see below, but also due to running out of sufficiently new things to learn and/or identifying unresolvable problems in the field)
    - Some of what fills my well is analyzing bad experiences, and I would be much happier if I accumulated fewer new bad experiences to analyze
    - The past turns into shame, and then I don't want to see it anymore

## Barriers related to providing output

- <ins>Providing info to other people is often diplomatically fraught</ins>, and has become much more so in the last 5-10 years: \*\*\*fuck if I know what to do about this, and it's not something I want to talk with her about\*\*\*
    
    - in some social settings, knowledge = social status = morality: claiming to know things someone else does not know will be read as an implied insult (you just implied they didn't know something which means you must have been trying to call them immoral!). If someone dislikes you, and you visibly display knowledge, they may see it as you trying to get above yourself and hyperfocus on small mistakes or omissions-for-simplification in order to demonstrate that you aren't 100% accurate in order to prove that you're immoral and should be ejected from the space. Being an expert makes you a target.
    - in many social settings, being allowed to display knowledge is a function of your existing social status: some people give and others receive. This has been especially true in the tech-worker-heavy settings I've been in, where it's often very gendered: men give knowledge, women are audiences. It's also true in queer spaces and social justice spaces: learning is risky because knowledge is the property of people with those identities.
    - in pretty much all settings, everyone is suffering from information overload, especially in the last few years.
    - people who do ask for knowledge are often not asking for knowledge, they're asking for confirmation, and sometimes the evidence doesn't support what they want to know and they'll get super offended
- In writing: \*\*\*fiction\*\*\*
    
    - ==**It's difficult to get writing advice focused on Input as a \*strength\*, rather than a weakness: the explicit goal is usually to get students to use it \*less\* (and using exposition, backstory, or worldbuilding more effectively is almost always equated with using it less). Many of my favorite writers are excellent at exposition and worldbuilding, but most writing advice focuses on eliminating exposition and worldbuilding as much as possible and sees "doing it better" as almost always equivalent to "doing it less". But there are internals-heavy writers who are bestsellers! They're doing it somehow, it's just rarely talked about in teaching.**==
        - **I can read these writers but I don't have the tools to analyze them**
        - Write action and tension around the knowledge the reader needs to get
        - In editing, ask not "Is it necessary to know this here" but "is it necessary to know this, and if so, is this an effective delivery method? Is there another place, or do I need to change the setting/action to support the delivery?"
        - I think I need feedback from readers who are actually interested in learning things they don't know, so that I can get feedback on what I'm doing that's effective vs not. I'm not sure how to find those people.
            - Conflict with neurodiversity approach here—strong emphasis on shaving off everything unique in order to make characters more "relatable"; intense pressure to justify characters' uniqueness but without actually saying anything about it
Make a list of writers who structure books around worldbuilding specifics (e.g. Robert Jackson Bennett) or other Input stuff and look for which ones have classes or recommendations. Same for writers who are good with internals and exposition. And writers whose books are not hyper focused on Going Places and Doing Things and Talking to People

# Strategic:

## Barriers related to envisioning and executing strategy:

VISION ISSUES, memory issues

## It gets too fucking complicated because I like thinking about things to much and I can't hold all the relevant bits in my head. Vision and memory issues also lead to things becoming overcomplicated

\-\- need better visualization / expand things from one seed

\-\- need to be able to see things simultaneously or rapidly navigate around something - expand/collapse but with good formatting and interlinking (that prevents info from being duplicated and then only updated in one place). Wikis don't work; they hide info

\-\- need to be able to distinguish between \*generative\* material that's not fixed on the page but is necessary, and fixed-on-the-page facts

\-\- how to \*not\* add complexity when it's what I enjoy most

\-\- awful thing in editing where I have third-layer effects that clash but fixing one breaks the other, and I just circle between them chasing the problem in an endless loop

==**Potentially useful vs actually-being-used material - generative vs implemented vs potential material - very hard to remember the distinction - like needing a new index for each book edition, but I go through multiple unmarked mental additions**==

- it would be extraordinarily helpful to see other people who do this and how they do it. for it to be helpful, the info has to genuinely be stored outside their head; the outside stuff can't just be a mental shortcut
- \*\*maybe need something printed out? \*\*
- need to indicate in reference materials how fixed something is based on how much is dependent on it being one way instead of another
- sometimes the specific is there to e.g. reinforce worldbuilding (it's flavor); sometimes it's plot-dependent
- stuff can be not down on the page but still fixed
- need to distinguish brainstorming / idea phase notes from reference notes
- system needs to be robust enough to survive whatever I do to it with Strategic

## Needing to narrow scope:

\-\- Decision fatigue; needing to make fewer decisions, but \*choosing not to make a decision\* takes more energy than making the decision

\-\- Writing advice fatigue: I internalize too many strategies

\-\- Also, in getting writing help it means I often ask for help because I can see multiple paths and don't know how to choose, but other people can only see one path and don't understand why I'm having a problem. I get decision fatigue.

\-\- Not knowing how to plan so I DON"T wind up with super complex issues

## Not in writing:

\-\- It requires incredibly high diplomacy

"Strategic is one of the places (Ideation is the other) that can help with excellent plot

twists. It's mostly about being in the moment and thinking "what if this happened" inside your book, though. Not necessarily about planning ahead, or needing to know the end."

\-\- problem with this: Conflict between next-action-in-a-scene optimization and book-level strategy; most writing advice I have gotten is aimed at the immediate moment

## Barriers related to getting feedback on strategy:

In writing, the importance of a piece of exposition is not always immediate

not being able to effectively convey why a detail is important (so there are lots of details from Input already which doesn't help, but the strategic means that critiquers often advise cutting things that need to be there). I don't think this is an issue with exposition, I think it's an issue with \*having plots that depend on backstory or setting\*. In other words, I think to reach those readers I need to have less \*important\* plot and more \*unimportant\* plot, to lower the speed. I don't think the problem is that I put in exposition, I think the problem is that the scenes aren't sufficiently designed \*around\* the exposition.

Also I've often already considered lots of other options and rejected them—often because they would create major issues in some other part of the book. But somehow this isn't an issue for other people when they write and I don't know how.

If exposition/backstory are sufficiently effectively delivered, people don't notice that they happened, and suggest cutting that text

Raises problems with writing advice because advice makes every word choice more fraught. It shows me more ways I can screw up.

==How do I NOT use strategy? "If you are used to indulging these patterns, they're going to be used to firing, and on some level, you have to stop them from firing, which takes intentional work and time. Not that it isn't possible, or worth it. It's just, it's not something you do while you're in the middle of changing a lot of other things, because you'll hit the crisis point with it, and it'll end up being much easier to just give in and indulge, and then you will, because you'll run out of willpower stores. Willpower is finite." How to use "normal" levels of strategic?==

==Strategic as better sometimes when they don't plot - how to do this? "Writers with high Strategic tend to do well when they write into the book and need to come up with creative ways to get out of a situation. Lean into this, especially in the way you pace your books."==

**I need feedback on strategy before I have a finished polished chapter for beta readers because the finished polished chapter takes so much fucking time and then I have to destroy it all**

Strategic:

Prejudice against neurodivergence disguised as a criticism of Strategic: "I'm confused" but if I spell it out "This is too much"

Common causes of being blocked: Not knowing something you'll need to know in the future, or having made an error in the past

My issue: not being able to visualize dependencies but knowing they're there / not being able to get everything loaded into my head

Conscious vs subconscious intuition - Strategics have both

giving myself instactions I can fulfill with responsibility but qtp at execution time destroys it

throwing stuff at them to try to help unblock them

"puzzle piece" writing though she does not plot at all

Yoon-Ha Lee: needs a detailed plan to diverge from

# Learner:

Learner/Responsibility: want to apply what I've used somewhere

Learner/connectedness: system-studier and systems thinking

Learner/relator and learner/individualization: studier of people to their depth

- I don't know what I don't know until I start researching, and often discover I need to know way too much about something to include it effectively, after I've written elements that already include it

\## Problems:

**<ins>Knowing too much creates problems</ins>: \*\*\*for nonfiction writing\*\*\***

- - Too much input can also mean knowing too many exceptions to generalizations, so that nothing that can be communicated quickly or coherently is trueClash with Responsibility: desire to use info responsibly leads to need to cover all exceptions to a generalization, lest someone be left out and harmed or offended by it; the time commitment and stress this causes makes writing nonfiction infeasible, and trying to push past it makes writing aversive

\*\*I can't get the pattern down on the page in the notes because it's a pattern, not a linear verbal description. \*\*

problem with teaching in environments where knowing stuff is seen as pulling rank

would love to be a developmental editor but don't have sufficient credentials and am wary of participating in something scammy

I spend too much money on stuff I don't execute on

when I get knowledgeable enough the learning slows down and it's not fun anymore

"dynamic work environments where you are asked to take on short

project assignments and expected to learn a lot about the new

subject matter in a short period of time and then move on to

the next one.": I would LOVE this but the barriers are insurmountable—often I don't get enough time to think and process about the material

\*\*\*Indexing: I don't know how to reach the clients I want\*\*\*

**very aware research isn't enough to write effectively, due to my very in-depth experience in some fields; clash with responsibility**

in high social justice-y environments, knowing a lot makes me a threat that needs to be neutralized, plus seeing connections between things is like infringing/appropriation

I often go into learning something new expecting to be able to produce, but then there are unspoken requirements that create accessibility issues for me that only surface late in the process - usually social ones (required extroversion in particular e.g. indexing—often related to failing markets, often related to cold-calling or networking, or to work speed-up to the point that there's no time to do needed thinking; or, I'm either in a position where I have no competitors and therefore no backup/support or I'm in a job where a coworker perceives themselves to be in competition with me) and usually ones that aren't mentioned because people can't imagine anyone being unable to do it. Sometimes things like "having to advocate for yourself" and often things like being given responsibility without any power or influence and with other people actively working against me

# Intellection

hit that gold vein or have that clear, perfect thought baby

bad with housemates in the past

horrible with jobs because needs time and less pressure

everything I do requires thought or visual processing

people often think I'm over-complicating things but it's actually that I literally can't see the simple solution or the simple framing of the problem without an enormous amount of conscious simplification; I have to manually assemble the gist from the details

*Intellection is how I get to simplicity. I have no other way to approach it. **How do I explain this effectively to people?***

# Responsibility

Worried about this with work and developmental editing possibility. Also with tech writing.

Leads to difficulty taking work that meets my accommodation needs because it's immoral to work for a packager

Writing advice is intensely rough on Responsibility people because it places enormously high commitments on us

Considering the reader too effectively also makes writing impossible!! and this is what my previous training keeps enforcing

i\*\*I can maximixe the fuck out of a piece of writing....and then I have to trash it because the reader identifies some high-level issue that, if I had early feedback on, woule mean I would write the scene an entirely different way! \*\*

\*\*Effort lets me produce writing that is too good for my skill level. \*\*

Writing advice *does not privilege judgment*

"Doing it the only way I can figure out to do it" is often mistaken for "insisting on doing it perfectly".

the only way I've found to handle this is to refuse to commit to deadlines, or to just accept that everything will take me three times as long the next person, and write down fake hours

**I don't know how to find clients that value quality (in the sense of, preferring a well-done result to a fast result)**

I think I actually \*do\* need to edit as I write
