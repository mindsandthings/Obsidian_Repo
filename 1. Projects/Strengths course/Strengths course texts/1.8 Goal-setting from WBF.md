In case you haven't yet taken Write Better-Faster, here is the goal-setting lecture from that class, as a quick reminder about why I'm not a big fan of changing too many goals, and why we're always drilling down.

After students take these assessments, and get their first introduction into understanding how they’re wired, the first question they typically ask is, “WHAT DO I DO NOW?”

Listen to me very carefully. DO NOT CHANGE ALL THE THINGS. 

Most of us have a long list of what we want to change. About ourselves, about our careers, about our books. And for the most part, unless we have training in self-leadership, or a super-refined intuitive sense of how change works, a lot of us also come from the New Year’s Resolutions camp. We want to change All. The. Things. And we want to do it TODAY (or, for you Activator/Focus types, YESTERDAY). 🙂

That is not the way to lasting change.  

It’s the way to frustration. 

Instead, what we’re going to talk about is small, incremental change that will **last**. Because that’s what we want. We want change that will last. 

All this studying of personality and wiring is not to say that there’s a perfect plotting system that every Context **has to use**, or that all Relator people must move to a cabin in the woods. The studying of personality is not resolutely prescriptive. It’s not like being diagnosed with a disease. I don’t say, “all Ideations need this particular system.” If I thought it worked that way, I would write a book about it, instead of teaching a class and coaching. It’s much more nuanced and layered than that. **The studying of your personality is so that, when you’re making decisions, you can make smarter choices based on who you are, and not who someone else is**.

And so you can know the WHY. Which really is what so many of us are looking for. We want to know why.

But the real magic of this concept, is the **_combination_** of leveraging your personality, and learning systems thinking. We’re not going to make big, grandiose changes based on your personality alone. Your personality is a guide. This is why we cover the areas of writing, one at a time, and I don’t just print out a list of what you should do based on your Myers-Briggs type (which, even in WBF, is not something that I suggest). That would be the easy way out, and it would only work for about half the students.

We study how you’re wired so we can get down to the absolute nitty-gritty (as precisely as possible) of why what you’ve been doing hasn’t been working for you (and also, what _has_ been working and definitely shouldn’t change). There will be discussion, throughout the class, of how certain personality types will benefit from certain systems, for sure. **But the secret sauce of how to write better-faster is part personality science and part systems thinking**. We want **customized** smartness (personality) coupled with environmental tweaks (additional neuroscience resources, my coaching experience, and your personal systems) that will get you where you need to go.  

Systemic Change That Will Last

If you haven't read the _Four Disciplines of Execution_ or _The One Thing_, this next concept may take some time to assimilate the idea of focus-on-one-thing. As they talk about in _Four Disciplines_, we tend to fix problems primarily by learning new strategies. Business schools and graduate schools are rife with strategy learning, like somehow, if we can just learn the right theory, we’ll magically be able to execute the right tactics. But executing is the hard part, so that’s what we tackle first. How to execute well. 

How to set goals that will _support_ your execution.

**Start Small** 

What Covey and his co-authors talk about in _Four Disciplines_ is that **_the most important part of execution is narrow focus_**. When we try to change too much, we fail too quickly, and then we throw out all the changes. Our life is a system, and it’s in motion (inertia), and it wants to stay in motion (inertia), and if we try to change too much, it will fight back (inertia). Did I mention… inertia? 

Trying to change 100% of your writing life is not going to bring you lasting change. Like most New Year’s Resolutions, your change will be too big, too generic, and too comprehensive. (You don’t have the time to feasibly shove in trying to eat right, exercise every day, stop watching TV, get off sugar, write 10 books, and also try to keep 99% of the life that you’ve been doing for the last however many years that you’re not willing to give up.) 

No.

We need to winnow down to the absolute most important thing that needs to change right now. 

The_4DX_ guys call this “one big thing” a Wildly Important Goal (or a WIG). In the 90s, leadership gurus called it a BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal). I split the difference between the two and call it a BigWIG, but the point is, **in order to be effective at execution in the long-run, you need to tackle only one big change at a time**. So you want to look at and evaluate the one area that you have in your life that will make the largest impact on your long-term goals. The one-goal is the keystone (remember this word--we'll be using it a lot). It’s the thing you’re willing to focus your daily time and intention on.

This “BigWIG” will likely not address the "general noise" of work that needs to get done every day, like making a FB post or checking email, marketing, or promoting, unless your BigWIG is a launch campaign or something of that nature. That’s the 90% that can stay the same for the time being. A BigWIG is something crucial and specific. Not busy-work.

There’s a famous story in _The Power of Habit_ by Chuck Duhigg where he talks about this idea of changing “one thing”. He tells about a woman he coached in habit formation who decided that she wanted to lose weight, so he analyzed her environment and they picked one area of change for her. 

Getting out of bed in the morning.

She quite literally got out of bed on the other side of the bed in the morning. Every day for six months. By changing that one thing, she quit smoking, lost fifty pounds, and changed jobs. In six months. By changing the side of bed she swung her feet onto the floor every morning.

Why did this work for her?

Because on the side of bed she usually got up were her cigarettes. And that first reach-for-a-cigarette moment was her keystone habit. It was the thing that sent her down the path toward smoking and overeating every single day. 

So, when she decided to get out of bed on the other side, she still left the cigarettes there. She still had the opportunity to do it. But when she put her tennis shoes on the other side of the bed, and saw those every morning, and was reminded of her goals, she ignored the first cigarette and went for a run instead. She wasn’t perfect, but just that one tiny change made her whole life change. 

I had a high Harmony client who had a similar story. She would have some days where she was “inexplicably” angry when she got out of bed in the morning. And of course, I said to her, it’s impossible to wake up angry. You wake up in a neutral state, and something makes you angry, you just aren’t aware of it. So we went through a whole big set of questions trying to find the thing that was making her angry in the morning. Turned out, it was her bedroom shade. 

The days when her bedroom shade was open, her day would be horrible. The days when her bedroom shade was closed, her day would be better.  

Why? 

Because she had an ongoing, difficult, extremely volatile conflict with her neighbor, and when her bedroom shade was open, the first thing she saw when she woke up was the neighbor’s house. Having high Harmony, and living in the middle of that conflict, the first subconscious thoughts she had in the morning were about this conflict. Even when she moved on to dress her kids or make breakfast, etc. She’d woken up looking at this neighbor’s house, and without even realizing it, she was having a bad day. 

She closes her bedroom shade every night now. The conflict with the neighbor is not solve-able. But what is solve-able is how often she has to think about it. 

**Small, consistent change is the key to long-term, systemic change**. 

Just one habit. One thing. Like… not reaching for your phone when you wake up in the morning (do not get me started on the statistics about that one derailing productivity…ok, nevermind, do get me started, but we’ll cover that in a future lecture). Or it might be not answering emails until night-time. Or it might be only working on one project at a time. 

So, that's the version from Write Better-Faster. In the case of Strengths, we're going to narrow down to one or two big behaviors to focus in on. Not that you have to necessarily find a "habit". More because this is not an intuitive process (narrowing) for most people. So I wanted you to hear me talk about it before we get into the meat of the Strengths lectures.

PLEASE UNDERSTAND: I don't expect you to come up with the BIGWIG all by yourself. That's why we do the one-on-ones. But I want you to know why the BIGWIG is important, and why we keep ourselves from Change All the Things Mode. 🙂 And develop our Strengths.
