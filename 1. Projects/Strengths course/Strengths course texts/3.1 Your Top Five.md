You have already (hopefully) either sent our classroom manager your reports, or taken the test with the code you were emailed and sent her a copy of your report. If you haven't, make sure you do that right now and **send her a copy**.

Once we have your report, we will generate and email you your Top Five Strengths reports. **This is not an automatic process. Annette has to do these by hand and so it make take a couple of days to get the entire process all the way through.** Please read these reports and reply to the email with any questions. Generally, everyone's coaching assignments and packets have gone out by the end of the first week.
