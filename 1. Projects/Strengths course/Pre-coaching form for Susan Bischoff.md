# **What is your writing background? (career, hobby, published, pre-published, etc. Number of current books, genre. Tell us anything you think we should know!)**

From my bio for the course: I worked as a project manager and data manager before leaving the workforce in 2015 due to disabling health issues. I was recently correctly diagnosed and treated, and gained a lot of capacity for change that I didn't have before. I read the Quitbooks in June and have made and sustained some large changes to my life as a result.

I'm working on the second draft of a novel and looking into adding part-time freelancing. I have one published short story, some unpublished ones, and two abandoned novels.

Additional info: My current novel is a humorous contemporary fantasy with a strong focus on characters' psychological dynamics and growth. It was much easier and quicker to draft than the novel I abandoned, and I'm hoping to shop it around to agents after I finish it. If I'm not able to get an agent within a year of beginning to shop it, I plan to self-publish it. I'm also working on a just-for-fun cozy mystery with my sister. 

I would like to be a career novelist, but I don't write quickly enough; I doubt I could reliably write one book a year, so I would have to be both a much better writer and a much better networker than I am to make a living.

I have also published nonfiction pieces on the representation of autistic characters in fiction, and have edited a nonfiction anthology with contributions by adult-diagnosed autistic people (the anthology was commissioned and published by the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, which has a small independent press). I attended Clarion West in 2016 and wrote a blog post on deciding whether to attend Clarion West as a disabled writer, which Clarion West thought was a good enough introduction for potential applicants in general that they later hired me to help incorporate much of the post into their workshop FAQ. Unfortunately, writing disability-related nonfiction eventually became so stressful it was no longer worth the time (and there is no meaningful market, so it's not a viable career path).

# **What brought you into this class? What is your goal here?**

I came into the class because I did some strengths work on my own and felt it would be helpful to have access to more intensive material and support. My goals for the strengths course are 1) try new ways to address complex information management issues related to writing, 2) come up with better strategies for getting useful feedback from early readers, and 3) figure out more sustainable ways to learn and incorporate writing advice.

# **What do you get paid to do (full-time/part-time) right now?**

My husband has been supporting me financially since I had to stop working in 2015.  I  hope to start part-time paid writing-related work sometime next year, in addition to continuing to write fiction. I've considered technical writing, developmental writing, and indexing. I absolutely love indexing but the field is collapsing, and I'd enjoy developmental writing but I have other reservations, so it's probably going to be technical writing.

# **What is your most significant accomplishment of the last 12 months? (could be in any arena of life)**

I was a good enough housemate/friend to my housemates that they asked me and my husband to be godparents for their adorable two-year-old (aka backup parents in case anything happens to them).  

# **What do you feel you do the best in your writing / platform right now?**

When other people have positive things to say about my work, it's generally something about it being quirky/charming.  

# **What is your biggest pain point in your writing / platform right now?**

Information management.

# **What are your hobbies or interests?**

In the recent past, I've taken bass guitar lessons, learned ASL, and done some gardening. I'm currently working on developing an online escape room experience with my husband, and I read a lot of fiction (most often thrillers, mysteries, and SFF).

# **How would you describe yourself in three short phrases?**

Someone who is experiencing distress at realizing I need an elevator pitch for my personality. 

Other people would probably describe me as either quiet/helpful or annoying/irritating. 

# **What is the most important challenge you currently face?**

I have difficult creating outlines that I can follow. When working on an individual scene, I often have to change or add details. In order to maintain consistency across scenes and prevent plot and character arcs from being confusing and disjointed, I need to notice when I change or add details, track those details, and anticipate the problems they'll cause for me in earlier and later scenes. It feels like working on a complex puzzle where every piece is dependent on at least five other other pieces I can see plus at least five more that are just outside of what I can keep in my head but that will bite me in the ass in five chapters, except I don't notice the problems until I'm doing revisions, by which point I've created multiple second-level tangles that I have to unpick by hand.

The alternative—writing without outlines—results in my either being unable to write or writing unfocused exploratory passages that interest only me and are much more inconsistent with each other.

# **What do the next ten years hold in store for you?**

Generally, I've found a short-term goal focus to be most helpful to me. Over the next year, I'd like to finish this novel and begin shopping it around, and to begin working for pay part-time.

# **To meet your expectations, what do you hope to address in coaching?**

Here are a few potential coaching topics/questions. Maybe you could pick one you think you could address, or suggest other topics you think might work well.

\_Input\_: Where to find writing advice focused using Input to write stronger, more enjoyable backstory/worldbuilding/exposition, as opposed to writing advice focused on keeping it as barebones as possible?

\_Strategic\_: I write slowly and have a poor memory. I need to develop an information tracking system that actively supports my ability to identify dependencies in worldbuilding, plot, and character arc for a given book—including tracking what's on the page, the underlying generative information that gives rise to what's on the page, and how fixed or flexible any of it is based on how many problems I'll create by changing it. 

\_Learner/Responsibility/Input/Intellection\_: Once I know too much about a topic, I can no longer write nonfiction about it, because each concept lights up at least five associated concepts, each factual statement has multiple caveats, and there are no linear paths through the information anymore. By this point I also know the topic well enough to know the problems that simplifying concepts will cause. I've tried to pick out bite-sized, manageable chunks but still wind up unable to write anything concise, clear, and accurate in a cost-effective amount of time. 

# **Any additional comments?**

# leftover notes

I write humorous/quirky fantasy with some serious themes and a strong focus on characterization. I'm interested in how neurodivergence affects how people think and interact, both in fiction and real life; I ran weekly chats for Twitter's autistic community for five years and have published pieces on autistic representation in fiction.

I worked as a project manager and data manager before leaving the workforce in 2015 due to disabling health issues. I was recently correctly diagnosed and treated, and gained a lot of capacity for change that I didn't have before. I read the Quitbooks in June and have made and sustained some large changes to my life as a result.

I'm working on the second draft of a novel and looking into adding part-time freelancing. I have one published short story, some unpublished ones, and two abandoned novels.

Demographics: early 40s, married, no kids, spouse supports me financially. Autistic/ADHD/misc, academic background in behavioral science and information science.

In late 2015, I had to stop working due to undiagnosed physical health issues, and focused on writing fiction. I published one short story and wrote multiple drafts of a novel, which I later shelved. Last year I was correctly diagnosed and treated,

began writing seriously in 2016 after having to stop working due to a disabling health problem. I wrote multiple drafts of a novel from 2016-2021,

I write humor fantasy

My WIP's protagonists

I previously edited a nonfiction anthology of pieces by adult-diagnosed autistic people, and have published essays on representation of autistic characters in fiction, and

Before reading the Quit books, I would have said I wrote a little slower than average. Now I would describe my pace as glacial.

When writing, I like exploring

I think that what I enjoy reading and writing may not

I live in the Bay Area and have been writing seriously

My academic background is in information science (user experience research and design) and behavioral science (cultural/evolutionary and developmental psychology, social cognition, and cognitive anthropology).

My writing process consists of having a lot of associations, putting them all down on the page, and trying drag a linear narrative out of them.

Generally I have found

I think about characters, situations, backstory, and settings as complex patterns or webs of associated facts.

I can't write without a clear, detailed outline, but I can't stick to an outline when I have one.

I've accepted that I'll never write quickly, but I would like to

The need of a story is to have necessary backstory and exposition in place at the right times; the need of a scene is avoid almost all backstory and exposition.

In the last year and especially the last 3 months, I've had major health improvements that created a lot of capacity to change, and in the last couple months I've begun walking 5,000-10,000 steps a day and

1.  Information management issues due to the way I think (patterns to linear). Another is that the patterns of character tendencies are abstracted from a lot of different people, meaning that it's possible to pull on those broad patterns but wind up with an internally contradictory specific person. I can specify it, but it takes a lot of words, and then I have to remember what

it's difficult to identify at the time I'm writing something whether it's a feature that should be recorded and set in stone, and it's difficult to identify the level of specificity I need to be able to anticipate what I'll need to know in the future—especially because \*what I'm drawing on\* and will need in the future is actually not supposed to go on the page and is still malleable!

another problem: when I postpone solving a problem to a future draft, it's because I don't know how to fix it yet, not because it's an optional problem.

1.5) Plotting and information management issues due to combo of poor memory and discovery writing—slow memory means I forget which specific parts of the pattern I'm drawing on, or accidentally forget details and cause plot holes—if I knew what would be relevant at the time I was writing it I could put it in reference material, or

trying to ensure consistency also results in scenes that satisfice—if a chunk of writing has been carefully tweaked to do five different necessary things, anything that replaces it also has to meet those needs

I do a lot of reverse outlining to try to figure out what's essential and what's not

2.  Responding to feedback issues (both practical issue of how to get utility out of feedback, and the can't keep writing like this issue, and the bigger issue that agents and editors are going to raise the same concerns)

\-\- dislike of characters' neurodivergent traits framed as craft issue

\-\- lack of attention to pattern: what people advise changing or cutting would cause the coherence of the characters/plot to disintegrate

\-\- no space to put explanation in without making it clear why I'm explaining, but definitely no space to put the explanation in

\-\- no space for anything not immediately relevant to the action, making it very hard to acquaint readers with anything they don't already understand

I have to explain characters to make them comprehensible but people don't want explanations. If I don't put in the explanations, they complain that the characters don't make sense.

I don't think people who bring these up are completely wrong, but they're not able to tell me how

I want to use feedback to help me do what I want to do better.

more broadly it's just hard to engage in learning environments when "what humans/readers/characters do" is universalized

3.  the difference between a rapid judgment and a very slow thorough judgment

When I try to fit this complexity into a story, I wind up with a huge information management problem. When I try to avoid putting complexity into a story, it winds up in there anyway. Either way, I can't

I have difficulty with managing exposition and backstory because my understanding of a character (or a situation) is an in-depth set of patterns or a complex web of associations, but it has to be told linearly on the page and trickled out in small, dispersed single facts—but rapidly enough and efficiently enough that

I have found that when I ask for

The need to justify my characters' decisions and actions, but without asking readers to consider that

The overwhelming focus in most critique on individual scenes without reference to the whole makes it very very hard to produce consistency

Most of my specific writing-related challenges are neither particularly important or particularly unsolvable, they're just tiring and stressful to handle. They're caused by being a slow writer with a poor memory who values writing about complex issues in complex ways, and who writes in a field where critique and teaching tend to focus on individual pieces of ~3k words without an equivalent focus on how to ensure those pieces fit coherently into a larger whole.
