*I write slowly and have a poor memory. I need to create an information tracking system that actively supports my ability to identify dependencies in worldbuilding, plot, and character arc for a given bookâ€”including tracking what's on the page, tracking the underlying generative information that gives rise to what's on the page, and tracking how fixed or flexible that information is based on how many problems I'll create by changing it.

## Plan
- [ ] #task reverse-outline existing scenes
- [ ] #task reverse-outline and update tracking info each time I finish a scene, including looking at how it affects other chapters
- [ ] Add columns when editing (copy in edit notes) and delete them when completed. 
- [ ] When tracking character arc/personality: when the characters are generated from a pattern, only record when they deviate from the pattern. 
	- [ ] *I did not think to ask her about the problem with having internalized overly real patterns that are inconsistent with themselves* - ask about this in a followup call
- [ ] Remember to ask any copy-editors to look out for consistency issues. 



# Writing nonfiction
*Once I know too much about a topic, I can't write about it anymore because I can't find simple, linear paths through the information. Each concept lights up at least five associated concepts and each factual statement has multiple caveats. Editing this into something bite-sized and manageable takes so much time and frustration that it's no longer worth it to write. When choosing whether to simplify, I can see probable real-world harm done by simplifying information to make it more easily conveyable, which adds a layer of difficulty. 



## Becca notes
* Individualization - is it something you feel everyone needs to read about, or something I need to say? 
	* it's about affecting third parties
	* she got around it by writing to a very specific person when she's writing the article
	* quitbooks have each chapter written to a different person
		* adding caveats about if you are not this way it won't work for you
		* so pitch at eg autistic middle class white women and say if you fit this mold you will likely have had these experiences
		* instead of giving them their demographics: give some specific things like "If you are writing by your gut, _____" 
			* Giving them a part of the pattern so they can see if they ID with it, since general demographics can be alienating
			* 
		* short pieces as much as possible: why she does a lot of coaching letters, because people ask questions and she answers their specific question
		* "we have a very similar set of strengths"
		* "just know there are always reasons why you're correct about your perspective and we just need to find what "
		* ***If I use this she says send her an email and let her know how it went*** - she likes to hear whether those particular pieces are successful

could I make an index and then pick a chunk of index, to write nonfiction?



Susan recommended reading and analyzing examples of others' nonfiction. We also talked about the responsibility of editors and the importance of finding a trustworthy editor, which would not help much for my primary topic but could help for less charged topics. 

Finding writing advice focused on using strengths to write stronger, more enjoyable backstory/worldbuilding/exposition, as opposed to writing advice focused on keeping it as barebones as possible. 

We talked about this mostly in relation to Input. My plan is to make a list of authors whose works do things I like and look for whether they have patreons/substacks/etc with useful advice. 


# Exposition/backstory
they're wrong
they're not your readers
Mandy Roth - 50-75% context - compared to Shannon Mayer - immediate into conflict

Empire Records - movie - most ocnnectedness. when you get to the end the thread pulls

scenes felt disconnected but brought us closer to characters, acted in a compelling way, didn't contain irrelevant info

read some contemporary fantasy that feels more like that
Italo Calvino
Neil Gaiman
where it feels like I know more about world and people than the plot

The Midnight Library
Circe by Madeliene Miller [good for high communication]

books that break rules of backstory

story compelling, some open loop always dragging you forward

ensuring on every page something compelling and interesting is happening





# Strengths development
* High Input/Individualization makes anything feel like it needs tweaking. Assume your 2009 results are correct until you run into a piece of info that feels like it doesn't belong, then question the premise. If you think it might be some other strength, see if something in your top 5 might be mimicking behavior. 
- [ ] #task In October, raise Patreon level and find the topical call from Sep/Oct/Nov 2021 on low adaptability. The coach was high discipline and low adaptability; if I super-resonate with what she says about what she has to have to function, look for people to learn from who give off that discipline vibe, like Sarah Cannon, who does the same process every month, and Lindsay Buroker.

individualization and connectedness - quite a role in my writing - the ones she suggests paying the most attention to out of my next five

do a deep dive when I can, but focus on top 5 the most
