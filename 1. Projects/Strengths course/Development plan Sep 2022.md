Please go back through your notes, as we end class, and create action steps for how you will act on this plan. Keep the action steps small.


DAILY: Watch for my Strengths, label them either live or in retrospect, and journal about how I'm using them (especially how I see them showing up in my writing).

WEEKLY: Review my journal pages and make notes about patterns I see in how I use my Strengths and how I can execute more often.

MONTHLY: Check in with the Strengths community for X Strength. Share some of my insights and learn from the development plans of other writers.

QUARTERLY: Check in with Becca about how my X Strength development is going. See if I should schedule a follow-up one-on-one, or continue in what I'm doing. Am I in a place where I could get regular Strengths coaching? Or is it best for me to keep developing on my own?

ANNUALLY: Take the SFW Check-In class and get re-centered on developing my Strengths, or pick a new Strength to start developing.


# Info tracking: Adopt new revision practices
*I write slowly and have a poor memory. I need to create an information tracking system that actively supports my ability to identify dependencies in worldbuilding, plot, and character arc for a given book—including tracking what's on the page, tracking the underlying generative information that gives rise to what's on the page, and tracking how fixed or flexible that information is based on how many problems I'll create by changing it.

## Plan
- [ ] #task reverse-outline existing scenes
- [ ] #task reverse-outline and update tracking info each time I finish a scene, including looking at how it affects other chapters
- [ ] Add columns when editing (copy in edit notes) and delete them when completed. 
- [ ] When tracking character arc/personality: when the characters are generated from a pattern, only record when they deviate from the pattern. 
	- [ ] *I did not think to ask her about the problem with having internalized overly real patterns that are inconsistent with themselves* - ask about this in a followup call
- [ ] Remember to ask any copy-editors to look out for consistency issues. 



# Writing nonfiction
*Once I know too much about a topic, I can't write about it anymore because I can't find simple, linear paths through the information. Each concept lights up at least five associated concepts and each factual statement has multiple caveats. Editing this into something bite-sized and manageable takes so much time and frustration that it's no longer worth it to write. When choosing whether to simplify, I can see probable real-world harm done by simplifying information to make it more easily conveyable, which adds a layer of difficulty. 

- [ ] #task Write to a specific person. Instead of giving demographics, give a specific part of the pattern; add caveats about how if you are not this way, it won't work for you
- [ ] #task If I use this she says send her an email and let her know how it went—she likes to hear whether those particular pieces are successful
- [ ] #task Read and analyze examples of others' nonfiction
	- [ ] This needs revisiting


*Could I make an index of my knowledge and then pick a chunk of index to write about?


# Exposition/backstory

Empire Records - movie - most ocnnectedness. when you get to the end the thread pulls

scenes felt disconnected but brought us closer to characters, acted in a compelling way, didn't contain irrelevant info

Focus on contemporary fantasy where it feels like I know more about world and people than the plot. Story compelling; some open loop always dragging you forward; ensuring on every page something compelling and interesting is happening

Italo Calvino
Neil Gaiman

The Midnight Library
Circe by Madeliene Miller [good for high communication]

books that break rules of backstory

Finding writing advice focused on using strengths to write stronger, more enjoyable backstory/worldbuilding/exposition, as opposed to writing advice focused on keeping it as barebones as possible. 

We talked about this mostly in relation to Input. My plan is to make a list of authors whose works do things I like and look for whether they have patreons/substacks/etc with useful advice. 




# Strengths development
* High Input/Individualization makes anything feel like it needs tweaking. Assume your 2009 results are correct until you run into a piece of info that feels like it doesn't belong, then question the premise. If you think it might be some other strength, see if something in your top 5 might be mimicking behavior. 
- [ ] #task In October, raise Patreon level and find the topical call from Sep/Oct/Nov 2021 on low adaptability. The coach was high discipline and low adaptability; if I super-resonate with what she says about what she has to have to function, look for people to learn from who give off that discipline vibe, like Sarah Cannon, who does the same process every month, and Lindsay Buroker.

individualization and connectedness - quite a role in my writing - the ones she suggests paying the most attention to out of my next five

do a deep dive when I can, but focus on top 5 the most
