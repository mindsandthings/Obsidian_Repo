# Aug 2022 areas of focus

Schedule time each day to think about your goals and strategies.

Always have at least three options in mind so you can adapt if circumstances change.

Be mindful of what is already working well and what others have accomplished.

I wind up channeling things through analytical/deliberative when I'd much, much rather run it through strategic for speed.

Strategic:

\-\- tendency to put something on the page that you take to have a lot of implications, but not putting the implications on the page so your readers don't know

\-\- basically: moving so fast that your readers can't follow the chain of thought.

\-\- perceives patterns much faster than analytical.

\-\- looking to find YOUR readers. Why not just exclude other readers from the beginning?
