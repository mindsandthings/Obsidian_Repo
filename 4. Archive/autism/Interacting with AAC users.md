# Interacting with AAC users
It depends on the person - like i have one friend who uses mostly vocalizations that approximate speech, and i know they prefer that over letterboard etc, so with them i ask them to repeat or ask their assistant if they can interpret (i have asked before and that's okay), if that's not working a couple of times then we'll move to letterboard. but someone who i know doesn't have a solid system yet (particularly if they're autistic) i do ask them direct questions and leave lots of time for answer but then don't necessarily repeat the question (as if assuming they didn't understand) or press them to answer because i want it to be low pressure and i don't want to presume they WANT to answer or interact with me. but unless they leave the area then i do still try asking questions after long pauses, or telling them what i'm thinking. so like when that dad kept answering for his teen i still directed the questions at her despite apparent lack of ability or interest in answering. ie, (contd)
 
I do think you understand, i'm not giving up on you or ignoring you, but take your time and don't feel pressure to engage
 
if it's someone i'm unfamiliar with but i'm under the impression they do have a pretty comprehensive system but i'm just not getting it
 
i think i lean towards just asking for them to repeat or say it in a different way. i think i almost always do that at least once before doing something like turning to their family/assistant and saying "what did they say?"
 
idk if that direct "i didn't understand, say it again" feels okay to allistic disabled people but i haven't come up with a more, like, subtle way of going about it lol
 
Oh
 
i also do try to be careful with the way i phrase it. ie, not, "you're not making sense", but "i'm having trouble understanding"
 
/when you are giving someone time to respond what do you do while you're waiting? like I don't want to make someone uncomfortable by continuing to show engaged body language if they're not interested in conversation, but I don't want to signal that I'm giving up and cutting off the conversation/
/(this is really helpful btw)/
 
ah yeah good questions
 
so i've seen different aac users display different preferences for this, and if you know someone has quick or easy yes/no signals then it's totally fine to say something like "do you want for me to wait for you to answer or would you rather us not all stare at you while you think about it/type/xyz?" if it's too unclear whether they will feel comfortable communicating an answer to that meta question, then i do err on the side of staying turned towards them and looking in their direction (not steadily necessarily but at least checking on their hands and face every second or two to see if they seem to be wanting to make progress on a reply.) i think i lean towards this potentially bc i typically interact with more apparently-allistic cp folks than with autistic aac users, and i've heard at least one of them talk about how frustrating it is when people just walk away from her instead of trying to understand. and i also trust more that autistic people if truly uninterested (contd)
 
or uncomfortable are probs more likely to just get up and walk away 
which, of course, is communication!
but most aac users i know aren't uncomfortable with those meta conversations. i have one friend who has easy to access buttons on his device for "i want to use my device to tell you something", "i want to use my body to answer yes or no questions", etc
 
"how can i communicate with you best" is definitely too open ended for some people so establishing early on (via support pepole if necessary) whether a yes/no signal system in place can lead to further questioning.
 
i also know someone who when they're really having trouble with their device, their support person says "a." pause. "b." pause. "c." pause. etc, until the person gives a signal. this is slow but if the person can really only give one small movement in that moment it can be the best way to determine what they want to say. obvs that's for someone who's literate though.
