2.  The ideal thing for autistic writers would be to have a comprehensive resource with targeted writing advice and support. I don't know of anything quite like that, but I'll put some general links and some writing-related links in the channel, and add more as I think of them. (edited)

    Twitter has a weekly chat for autistic people under the #AutChat hashtag.

    I edited an anthology of nonfiction essays about life and autism by people who were diagnosed/self-recognized as adults, all of whom are writers and at least a couple of whom are fiction writers (let me know if this is too close to promo and I'll take it out). The kindle sample includes my introduction which gives you a good idea of the contents of the book: [https://autisticadvocacy.org/book/knowing-why/](https://autisticadvocacy.org/book/knowing-why/ "https://autisticadvocacy.org/book/knowing-why/") (edited)

    Is autistic science fiction and fantasy dominated by cishet white men - or is something more complicated going on?

    I'm a member of a discord for autistic writers, although I haven't been particularly active in it. I'll ask them if I can post it here.
    
12.  _[_12:37 PM_]_
    
    I also have some articles on writing autistic characters, though those don't focus on writing process.

    Of the writing-related issues I've seen among myself and other autistic writers, the most common autism-related ones are probably executive dysfunction issues, sensory issues (e.g. can't write with noise in the house), and issues with critiques of neurodivergent characters that mirror real-life discrimination towards neurodivergent people, plus the emotional stuff that comes around it.

    Here's some advice for autistic writers that I wrote for an interview for Ada's substack (substack linked above). I think this is probably good advice for ADHD writers as well (I'm both autistic and ADHD fwiw): Try to meet other autistic writers, if you don't already have a network. Try to have at least a couple of your critiquers and early readers be autistic. It's also helpful to have autistic friends or fellow writers who are comfortable with letting you express frustration to them. Most of the autism-related ableism I've encountered with respect to writing is unintended, but it's still ableism, and it builds up over time. It helps to have people around who can sympathize and who will look at autistic themes or characters in your work and go "wow, relatable." Keep in mind that someone autistic also won't necessarily automatically sympathize and relate to your work, or avoid being ableist; you still need someone who's a good fit for you in other ways. If any critiquing relationship makes it persistently harder for you to write, or makes you feel like crap about yourself, it may not be a good fit. It's also possible that your best supporters will happen to be neurotypical, or neurodivergent but not autistic. In my experience, though, there are specific kinds of support that you have a much higher chance of getting from other autistic people, due to shared experience.

    Update: I talked to the owner of the discord I mentioned, which is an informal community of autistic writers who come together to talk about writing. (They wanted to be clear that they're not experts, just fellow writers who are also autistic.) Folks who are interested in joining can DM me to talk about whether it would be a good fit.
