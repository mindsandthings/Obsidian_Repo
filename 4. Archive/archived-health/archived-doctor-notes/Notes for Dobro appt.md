# Notes for Dobro appt

- - - -
I saw you for athlete's foot symptoms at the end of Dec. I get symptoms on my feet and crotch again if I stop using terbafine cream, or (for feet) if I wear outside shoes or get my feet damp and don't dry them right away and reapply cream. They start feeling dry and eventually itchy even with lotion, and (feet only) burning and/or a cold sensation different from the usual one I get with cold feet.

It takes longer to come back on my head. 

I'm not sure if I'm getting reinfected or if it never went fully away.

Michael had no symptoms for a couple months and then began having symptoms in one spot on his foot again. (Mine happen all over the soles of my feet.)

What should I do next?

Measures I've been taking:
-- continuing treatment for 6 weeks after symptoms have resolved
-- applying terbafine cream 2x/day and putting on clean socks
-- wearing loose-fitting pants and changing them daily
-- washing sheets every 5-6 days and towels after one use on sanitize with bleach
-- cleaning and sterilizing the bathroom floors, my shower shoes, and my house shoes every 4-5 days

My psych NP has asked me to get a 12-lead EKG based on new FDA guidelines for a risk of lamotrigine causing heart block, due to a family history of heart disease (my grandfather had heart disease and a pacemaker installed).
