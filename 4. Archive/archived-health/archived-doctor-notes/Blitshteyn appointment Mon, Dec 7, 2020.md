# Blitshteyn appointment Mon, Dec 7, 2020

12/7/2020 Blitshteyn notes

She has never heard of the Muldowney protocol
She asked about it and I described the core and lower being very easy and the upper body exercises being impossible and triggering pain and headaches; she did not follow up on that

Her: assumes my migraines are not "severe" because at their worst I was having them 50% of the time, 3-4 days straight a week, instead of every other day

Me, the last few appointments: Mestinon helps with muscle pain
Me, this appointment: dropping Mestinon to 2x/day results in increased muscle pain, I think that's contributing to pain while trying to sleep
Her: Maybe going off mestinon will reduce your muscle tension. "I'm not sure Mestinon can relax muscles. It can cause twitches." [I did not mention twitches]


pain:
I tell her pain 
her: yes, pain can definitely worsen dysautonomia
me: no one has ever told me that, I had to figure it out for myself
her: I wrote about it in one of my articles. Primary care doctors don't always know about it.
me: "I've never heard that specifically from a POTS doctor either" 
her: "Great! Follow us on Facebook, we post everything to there"

Like...everything I tell her that isn't "I'm getting better" gets ignored. She doens't care if I'm still having symjptoms. I think maybe I should tell her that in addition to not comparing me to healthy people she should not compare me to other POTS patients either. 

It was definitely a socially friendly call but she's honestly a shitty doctor who doesn't do her job. The one thing she has done that helped me was medication, which she keeps wanting me to stop.

I've been writing for 4-5 hours a day, and I have been doing household chores. 

although not without pain and discomfort. 

Overall: not having noticeable problems with POTS. I dropped the Mestinon to 30mg 2x/day because you said I should do that next. I think it does worsen muscle pain but not hugely. 

I think my main problem is back and neck and head pain now. Standing up is worse when my neck and head hurt but since it's instant I don't know that it's POTS. 

(if she asks) Lower salt: I'm still keeping salt lower than before but not extremely low. 

The subjective sensation is of something being out of place or very tight. Because of that, I tried doing the Muldowney protocol at home to see if it would help. I know I don't have a connective tissue disorder, but I thought strengthening muscles would help. 

There's three areas, two were helpful in reducing some back pain during the day and the third has been impossible. 

The three areas are core and upper body and lower body. Core and lower were fine; I progressed through the levels without much difficulty. Core reduced lower back pain and lower body helped be able to walk for longer distances before feeling sick. 

With the upper body ones, I was able to progress the head muscle ones to the top level even through they triggered headaches while progressingâ€”my upper neck and the area at the base of my skull would feel swollen and inflamed. At one point I tried transdermal magnesium using magnesium oil and DMSO on the base of my skull and my neck, and that doesn't eliminate the problem but it does help dramatically. Now that they're at the top level and I'm only doing them once every 3 days it's tolerable. 

Trying to maintain the lowest level of the shoulder, upper back, and arm exercises triggers intense pain or tendinitis issues. There are several I can't maintain or progress even at the very lowest level. I can do a higher resistance or more weight for very short periods of time - it's more an endurance issue than a strength issue. 

(if she asks) tendinitis: biceps. intense pain: the external shoulder rotation ones, the Y of the TYI, and the triceps. You're supposed to start at a minute and a half. Between a minute to a minute and a half, it goes from manageable to intolerably painful, and if I attempt it multiple days in a row it starts happening earlier and earlier. 

I also started doing trigger point work for scalenes, trapezius, and some other shoulder and neck muscles. With those and the magnesium I've been able to work up from thirty seconds to a minute and half at the lowest level of resistance by starting the lowest level at thirty seconds and only doing it every other day. 

[if she asks about during the day] I get in bed and relax. Tense muscles loosen up and it feels good for a bit. Then I gradually wind up in more and more pain. In addition to that, stuff goes out of place while I sleep. If I change position, something different will go out instead.
