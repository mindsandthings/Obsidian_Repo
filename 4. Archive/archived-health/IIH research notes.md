# IIH research notes

For all you folks who have had both a lumbar puncture and an intracranial pressure bolt test (admittedly, a small set), what was your opening pressure and what was the range of your ICP bolt pressures? How long between each measurement?

But back to your question, for IH specifically, standard is to do a lumbar puncture and measure opening pressure. However, I think intracranial pressure bolts are much more accurate, especially for people who have chronically elevated pressure that might fluctuate with position.

I’ve seen a lot of people with normal or high normal LPs have abnormal pressure on ICP bolt. I’m trying to learn more about why that is. I just know in this patient population, some doctors don’t think a normal LP necessarily means absence of IIH.

[ ] Look up how often tests for ICP are inaccurate
[ ] look up accuracy of diamox test
[ ] review notes in Driscoll book
[ ] ***What I'm willing to admit to when she asks; how long I'm willing to admit to doing this

-- thing is: I don't think it's exclusively that. because I need so little diamox, and because other thing shurt too. 

Past things: Topamax as test

	•	Read about intracranial hypertension causing POTS in some people
	•	I think that is part of my problem
	•	I tried leftover acetazolamide from my husband's high-altitude trip last year
	•	It helps with:
	⁃	I rarely feel ill while standing upright
	⁃	I can exercise without getting incapacitating neck and shoulder pain 
	⁃	I can do things for eight or more hours at a time
	⁃	The inability to think clearly that I've complained about to every healthcare provider I've seen for migraines
	⁃	[After using multiple times] Stop feeling pressure headaches followed by ongoing pain and draining in my left sinus
	•	It frequently helps with:
	⁃	Sleep
	•	It does not always help with:
	⁃	Discomfort and pain at base of skull [rest of body hurts less, therefore now more obvious]
	⁃	Feeling that sinuses and neck are allergic/swollen up [I think this is blocking drainage? Maybe it is blood? because I can feel draining before it gets really bad]
	⁃	Feeling that head is sometimes "full"
	⁃	
	•	What I want:
	⁃	a prescription where I can take it daily instead of having to fluctuate
	⁃	trying that for a while, then seeing what symptoms are left over
	•	Questions
	⁃	Do most people have the ability to 
	•	Sensation of draining
	•	1/4 of a **** tablet. Lasts 4-5 days.

List of remaining issues, for the future
