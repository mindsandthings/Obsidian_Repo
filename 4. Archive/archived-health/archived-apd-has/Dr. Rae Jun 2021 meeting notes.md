# Dr. Rae Jun 2021 meeting notes
* They filmed for a documentary. With Kelly Hagar(?) Ellis sister(?) August release, just before school. 
* Her ASL teacher is great, very sentence-focused, polymath - Terri Hayes - $30/hr
* I asked about sound sensitivity stuff:
	* Compressing loudness
	* Compressing frequency
	* yes, it enhances the noises that help distinguish speech
* She says Spanish and English would be basically the same
* She's writing a book with one or two other audiologists. Oliver Sacks-like. I offered to early read. She also said they need an editor but I didn't jump on that. 
* Phonak hearing aids are better at handling background noise. $2500; she would give them to me at cost. The trials are $500/pair; I could buy a pair and she says they won't check for if I'm overusing them. [I said potentially, I need to talk to M first]
* I asked her about reasons my paperwork didn't have an APD diagnosis:
	* She says they probably left it out because insurance would have used it to reject me
	* She says she thinks I probably do have an APD
* I asked her how to explain it in signing contexts:
	* "Hearing(finger to ear, not meaning hearing people) audiogram(like schedule but one handed) normal, but brain hearing loss"
* Article: 
	* might be interested in having us post it on her site
	* if she likes it she might be interested in having us put it in the book [I suspect this was something she'll forget about later]
