# Family hearing loss issues
From Mom: "I started to notice in my early thirties that I was having trouble understanding what people were saying in crowds and at parties and anywhere else where there was a lot of background noise. It just got worse over the years. Lorette I don't know about, but now I'm curious. Are you starting to notice some hearing loss? Your grandfather Perry is probably the culprit."

"A few years ago at the UT Audiology Department. However, I had significant hearing loss for some time and just delayed getting the evaluation and hearing aids because of the cost. So it's been somewhere between 5 and 10 years. I can be more exact if I get the records. Let me know if that would be helpful."

[Also, I remember her saying once she had a delay from one ear]
