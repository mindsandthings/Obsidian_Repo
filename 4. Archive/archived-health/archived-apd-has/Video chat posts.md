post on twitter about auditory processing burden and videochats, and add some about accessibility
and also the delay mimicking a processing delay
if mention LT, add cnxn to internet
notice what's happening and attribute it correctly

I recently wrote a guide to making video calls more accessible https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lEQ-66I07_19Bb4HEf1p6pDq1A4buxOzSKgpQaQHAoU/edit#. It's for an organization I volunteer with, and is targeted at folks who run meetings and trainings for that org, but a lot of the info in it is general-purpose. I have permission to share the document with folks, and I think it's ok for you to share it with other people too.

I'll also thread a couple suggestions for managing auditory fatigue. (People can really underestimate just how draining auditory fatigue can beâ€”like, I even knew it was a big problem for me and I still seriously underestimated it until recently. Videochats tend to have crappier audio than real life, even when the audio quality is relatively good.)

If at all possible, take breaks where everything is quiet. Put on noise cancelling headphones if you have them, without playing any audio. Brains get tired and need to recover.

I find automatic captions very useful as augmentation for speech, and suspect a lot of people who get tired from listening to video calls may also find it helpful.

Skype has automatic captioning, which you can turn on by default somewhere in the settings. Google Meet (the enterprise version of Google Hangouts) does too! Zoom does not, unfortunately. 

If you have an Android device, it may be able to run LiveTranscribe, which is a free Google app that provides live autocaptioning. You must be connected to the internet to use it, as it sends some speech data to Google for processing. It works only on microphone input; when I use it to caption videocalls, I set it by my computer/ipad speaker. Some people have apparently been able to implement a splitter setup so that they can both run sound to headphones and to LiveTranscribe, to get captions and sound via headphones on the same device, but I have not been able to make it work with mine.

If seeing someone's face helps, videochat software generally lets you pin a specific speaker's window, even if they are doing screensharing. 

Oh, and if you need captioning for already-recorded Zoom calls you can look into otter.ai, which does not do automatic live captioning unless you buy it for teams (and only puts the transcription in a separate window), but lets you upload recorded Zoom meetings after the fact and will auto-transcribe up to 600 free minutes a month.
