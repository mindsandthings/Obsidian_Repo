# APD notes for Abby's comments LGHA article

This article represents my experiences accurately. Those experiences have been very positive, to the extent that an accurate description caused an early reader to think we had written the article with the goal of describing the positives of hearing aids for APD—rather than our actual goal, which was to represent our experiences accurately. 

When we are talking about hearing aids, we are talking about our experiences as two specific people with auditory processing difficulties but who are otherwise hearing. Please don't try to generalize our experiences to d/Deaf/hard-of-hearing people, who generally undergo a different set of pressures. Hearing people with APD frequently grow up receiving the message that there is nothing wrong with our hearing and consequently no reason for us to need any accommodations; people who are d/Deaf/HoH (who may also have APDs) are more likely to be pressured or forced into wearing hearing aids, to have hearing aids and oralism in general oversold and presented as the only solution, and to undergo active pressure to prevent them from doing things that will make communication easier. 

This is not true of everyone—some people with APD are diagnosed as children and have access to accommodations, and some people who are d/Deaf/HoH have it denied by people around them. However, we both were not diagnosed as children. 

We think, that, on average, our experiences with hearing aids have been more positive than those of many d/Deaf/hard-of-hearing people, for several reasons:
* Based on talking with our audiologist and on [this paper/presentation],  hearing aids are generally more effective for APDs. 
* Neither of us previously were legally entitled to accommodations, although they would have been extremely helpful. 
* We both thought we were stuck with this for life. 
* Our audiologist very specifically and very carefully checks for auditory discomfort at a range of frequencies. 
* For Elizabeth specifically, the fact that these make things less painful is huge

There's a big difference between falsely being told that something will solve all your problems, and never having had access to anything that would make auditory processing easier. 

Again, we are describing our experiences. Ours. Not someone else's. 

If I were to compare, I suspect my own experiences would be closest to those of someone who grew up hard-of-hearing, 

I kind of wish people thought about what it would be like to grow up HoH but never having any help

Growing up with an undiagnosed APD 

Many of my experiences—especially social experiences—reflect those I've seen described by hard-of-hearing people. 

I am reconsidering whether I want to tell anyone d/Deaf/HoH about this, ever. 

For example, I suspect that a caption phone service—like those available for free to d/Deaf/HoH Americans—would have massively improved my mental health, especially during the earlier days of the Internet. It would still make my life better now! 

They don't make me non-APD, but there aren't other options for me—I'll always be a hearing person unless I actually lose hearing for unrelated reasons. There's no APD pride, no community. 


It really hurts to have someone I should have something in common with accuse me of writing propaganda for the enemy - and it reminds me that I'll likely to be put repeatedly into the "hearing/outsider" box more strongly when I describe any differences.
At the same time, I feel horribly guilty and like I traumatized Abby by having only positive associations with something that Abby has mixed ones with. 
At the same time, I'm genuinely upset and disturbed that what seems to have upset Abby was my actual experience, even if they didn't realize that it was really my experience rather than a purposeful slant. And I'm worried about my future - I won't be able to disclose comfortably in my ASL program or at potential future work, and it'll be a big deal if I don't and am caught. 
I think also like. If this is the best we've ever had why respond with that reaction, instead of "wow if this is so life-changing imagine if you could get other accommodations too!"
It's just. More goddamn trauma gatekeeping, and more refusal to believe that someone else's experiences aren't automatically better. More insta-rejection - but why were you expecting otherwise in the first place?
I think part of the problem here is not seeing somethign as a completely unique and discrete experience. Like, I can understand that ADHD people have stuff in common with autistic people! I wouldn't try to gatekeep that! I want people to recognize we have some differences but I just.
Is autistic culture more likely to be accepting because we know what it's like to not fit in anywhere? 

I'll have to be very sure of myself if I'm going to go in disclosing things and explaining things. Even if those thigns are just "I'm autistic and have an auditory processing disorder". My heart kinda hurts, honestly.
I think staying away from specifics unless asked, and waiting to bring it up until whoever I'm working with has expressed interest, is probably best. And maybe just don't mention the hearing aids; they're not necessary to mention. But do mention the APD, or there won't be anything to attribute the hearing aids too.

I really, deeply dislike people who act like I want some kind of cachet. ...I guess it's kind of like non-disabled people respond to people getting assistive devices: they don't understand that it's liberating and freeing to have access to an assistive device—or for that matter, an identity. 
There is overwhelming privilege involved in being able to blow off someone else finally getting the help they need. Finally having access to the identity they need. And I'm honestly angry about it. 

Also: Deaf people can sure be fucking ableist

It's worth keeping in mind that having access to assistive devices is phenomenally different than having no access to them.

I think I just realized that if the glasses fix my dysautonomia, it means I will no longer be chronically ill. If they fix my headaches, I'll no longer have that disability. 

Guess I better work on my self image. 
I am someone who had undiagnosed sensory disabilities - hearing and vision disabilities that got worse as I got older. Untreated complications led to a seriously impairing chronic physical illness (dysautonomia, plus increasingly severe headaches and back and muscle pain, which were frequent and lasted for multiple days) and also led me to develop mental illness. 
Hang on to the hearing and vision thing, though. That's grounding. That's real. Hearing and vision are largely things we understand to be real, even though people still receive ableism. 

I think describing it as both vision and neurological is fine. Perhaps see what words people use - neurological vision disorder? I don't know that this is actually my brain and not my eyes though. 
I would like to be able to go into the CSF stuff, and the venous outflow stuff, but I have no proof for htat, just speculation. 
I'll be able to compare the dysautonomia to long covid at some point, after more people are familiar with it. 
I'd love to be able to mention damage to the autonomic nerves and brainstem. 

Neurological sensory disabilities that had a lot of consequences while untreated. 
My experiences have been closest to those of the chronic illness community. 

Those are real experiences. It is genuinely wrong that those were not treated. They are solid things, not things you can fuck around with. 

It is immensely validating to have both the vision and hearing results. To have something physical that proves that these were problems. 
I would like to know if those caused the autism or if they were all caused by a third variable. Maybe there could be a type of EDS that affects neurological things but not other things? 

My story is my story and it's okay to have my story and for it to be mine. It's okay to be happy with being less disabled. It's okay to have assistive devices—I have hearing aids and prism glasses! 

To be honest, I kind of wonder if the autism was caused by the vision and hearing issues in combination with being homeschooled.
