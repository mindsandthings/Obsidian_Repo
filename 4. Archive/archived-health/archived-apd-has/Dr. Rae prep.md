# Dr. Rae prep
Please share anything that will help prepare for our meeting.:
1) For the bluetooth connection only, is it possible to reduce the painful high sounds a little more? (For listening to podcasts on my phone)

2) My kitchen/living room acoustics eat spoken words, especially with the stove fan is running. I'm also generally having problems with hearing in the presence of house sounds (central air, fans, air purifiers). I don't know if there's anything that can be done about this but I wanted to ask.

3) Are there any changes you know of that could help with Spanish (or Spanish-accented English)? Sometimes my roommate's nanny's words all come through just fine, even ones I don't know the meaning of, and sometimes multiple sentences come in as garbled junk.

4) endever* and I are writing an article about our experiences with the hearing aids and I want to check several technical details with you.

explain the sound sensitivity reduction again, since there's the pink noise and the compression and I'm not sure what "compression" actually means, or whether it does anything else

5) I'm also trying to figure out how to describe myself for the article. My statement for for insurance reimbursement lists hyperacusis, abnormal auditory perceptions, tinnitus, and I wanted to ask whether I don't have an APD diagnosis because you'd need testing to be able to tell whether I met criteria, or whether you think my auditory processing issues are probably subclinical, or for some other reason.


*6) if time: how do you explain auditory processing issues in ASL? 

I hope your spring is going well!

### Hi Dr. Rae! I hope your spring is going well. I got your voicemail a couple weeks agoâ€”thanks for checking up on me! I do have a few things I'd like to talk to you about. Do I schedule through the Calendly page? I see trial-related options 

### For reference, the list:

### 1) For the bluetooth connection only, is it possible to reduce the painful high sounds further? (For listening to podcasts on my phone)

### 2) My kitchen/living room acoustics eat spoken words, especially with the stove fan is running. I'm also generally having problems with hearing in the presence of house sounds (central air, fans, air purifiers). I don't know if there's anything that can be done about this but I wanted to ask. 

### 3) Are there any changes you could make that would help with Spanish? My roommate's nanny speaks Spanish and/or Spanish-accented English. Sometimes all the words come through as fine, even ones I don't know the meaning of, and sometimes multiple sentences come in as garbled junk.

### 4) endever* and I are writing an article about our experiences with the hearing aids and I want to check several technical details with you. 

### 5) I'm also trying to figure out how to describe myself for the article - my statement for for insurance reimbursement lists hyperacusis, abnormal auditory perceptions, tinnitus, and I wanted to ask whether I don't have an APD diagnosis because you'd need testing to be able to tell whether I met criteria, or whether you think my auditory processing issues are probably subclinical, or for some other reason. 

### need to ask Dr. Rae if I don't have an APD dx because she thinks I don't have one, or because she couldn't feasibly evaluate me for one over the internet, or for some other reason

### H93.233 - hyperacusis, bilateral
### H93.299 - other abnormal auditory perceptions, unspecified ear
### H93.13 - tinnitus, bilateral


### I think the best way to approach it might be to say we're working on an article and want to check some technical details with her. Then we can ask her questions. If she asks to see it we can say sure, once we're ready we will send you a link and you can check our technical details for accuracy
### 1:40 PM
### I have a few questions to ask her - in addition to asking about my dx I want to ask her to explain the sound sensitivity reduction again, since there's the pink noise and the compression and I'm not sure what "compression" actually means, or whether it does anything else
### and I also want to double-check that it's accurate to say they make the sounds that help with spoeech discrimination louder


### the use of noise filtering and speech enhancement
### Hearing aids are a step better as they use computer algorithms to reduce the noise and directional microphones to focus your hearing in the direction where speech is coming from.



### do the volume buttons adjust the loudness of the enhancement? or the pink noise?
### make some sounds louder
### ouchiness reduction through pink noise and comprsesion and ?

### There is a CAPD code (H92.25) but she did not diagnose me with it.
