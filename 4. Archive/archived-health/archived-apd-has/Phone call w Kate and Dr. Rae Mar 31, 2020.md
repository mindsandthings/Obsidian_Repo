# Phone call w Kate and Dr. Rae Mar 31, 2020
### Dr. Rae notes

### 1) moving forward
### 2) insurance ***potential diagnoses***
### 3)  "Have your physician complete the medical clearance form"

### bass might overdrive hearing aids

### ~Questions~
* ### Bluetooth connection pink noise alert interruptions
* ### Having to make my phone forget the hearing aids so they won't get interrupted by
* ### there's a rattle that happens sometimes with speakers in videochat and sometimes [verify] with music if connected by bluetooth. It does not happen if I have it on an external speaker, or if I'm playing bass over an amp. It happens both on ipad and on android.


### hyperacusis but talk to Kate before you do it
### tinnitus can try - often easier to get treatment for than hyperacusis "yes and it's bothersome" - will probably say no, or send you through a lot of diagnostics. 

### 80% of her denials asked for prior permission
### "it's that they can say yes, everything's covered and then you get a denial" because they're in customer service mode

### if they get a denial we can appeal the decision

### Unitron Discover 9s
### don't prescribe rechargeables because very buggy 
### in 5-7 years my next set will be rechargeable

### nonprofit practice - 
### cost of discover 9s $7,200 after taking into account the deposit
### (in general discover-9s are about 11k - guess they have a discount or something?)

### can pay extra to can keep current (trial) set as a backup

### some patients prefer to have an extra set of fully functional backups like if they go white-water rafting

### 1 set of Discover 9s
### Keep Noahlink
### 7,200 - all audiology services and warranty included. never be a charge for silly stuff. 
### retain Noahlink
### waive required backup s
### send back the flex trial set - just the hearing aids themselves - when agree new permanents are totally settled in. hang on to them for a few weeks.


### they have a 3-year warranty, and because it's through their practice it is a pediatric warranty so they don't ask any questions if you break something, instead of charging $500 to fix battery door etc. They will overnight you a new set if lost. 

### at close to 3 years, call them, sounds a little crunchy, they will send in for a re whatever, get a new pair for the end. so they wind up lasting 5-7 years.

### often better to send them an invoice with diagnostic codes

### ***problem is they don't have a protocol for cleaning it yet - need someone with regulatory authority***
### look into sending hearing test kit to me so they can get an audiogram - se eif even a slight amount of hearing loss, makes it easier with hyperacusis
### [Kate thinks having an audiogram date after the purchase date is not an issue but she'll check with dr. rae - sometimes doing it separately gives a second chance for reimbursement/ With no audiogram better insurance reimbursement because get to do, review, then decide if they want a second audiogram if they're not happy with the first]
