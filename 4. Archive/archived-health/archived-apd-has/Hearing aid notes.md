# Hearing aid notes
These are my notes for our appointment tomorrow. I figured I'd go ahead and send them to you and then you could have them in text. I can also go over them we meet. 

Good parts of bigger receivers
 - sounds feel friendlier and nicer
 - the kinds of lower sounds I like are more complex and interesting
 - spatial sense better (maybe because the pink noise in the two ears is more equal? but I don't know that for sure)
 - less bluetooth rattle

Cons of bigger receivers:
 - still harder to discriminate speech in noise even after we reduced the bass last week
 - I don't think the sounds that are more complex and interesting are the ones that help with speech discrimination. I think they might be adding auditory complexity that doesn't carry information
 - I'm more averse to extended conversation and auditory events than with the smaller receviers, although it took me a while to realize it. I think the increased complexity of non-relevant sounds makes me tired more quickly.
 - music still has too much bass or maybe not enough higher sounds, and I actually don't enjoy listening to it as much as with the smaller receivers
 - they don't solve the bluetooth rattle problem enough that I want to stop using over-the-ear headphones for music

So overall I think while the larger receivers are good for auditory comfort and for my sense of where I am in space, they're not as good for auditory processing and fatigue, and the difference is big enough that the smaller ones work better for me.

I'm ok going back to the smaller ones now, although if you think it would be worth trying to adjust the larger ones I am up for more experimentation. 

If we do go back to the smaller ones I would like to try adjusting the amount of pink noise in the left ear and see if evening them out some gives some of the same spatial sense benefit as the the larger ones do without sounding too far off.

	0. connect hearing aid to ipad, then turn ipad bluetooth off
	0.5 load pure tones on ipad at high pitch
	1. video from phone
	2. show ipad
	"I'm going to play a series of pure tones so you can hear how the rattle increases as the pitch decreases. First, I'm going to do it NOT over bluetooth, so you can hear how it sounds normally. After that, I'll do it connected to bluetooth."
	3. "I'm putting the hearing aid receiver up against the phone microphone now, that's what I'm taking this video with. The ipad's bluetooth is off, so the hearing aid is only getting sound from the air."
	4. Play different tones. "I'm going to play it at 1000..800...600...400...200...50...5...1." 
	Turn it off.
	Those all sound pretty clear." 
	5. "Now I'm going to turn the ipad's bluetooth on so that we can do the same thing through bluetooth."
	6. Turn it on.
	7. "Now the hearing aid is connected to the ipad through bluetooth, so we're going to listen to that same series of tones over the hearing aid's bluetooth connection.
	4. Play different tones. "I'm going to play it at 1000..800...600...
	400...hear that static? *pause, count to 10*
	200... now the rattling is coming in *pause, count to 10*
	50... the tone is almost inaudible now, but the rattling is even more audible *pause, count to 10*
	5... *pause, count to 10*
	1. now you can hear it pulsating. *pause, count to 10.*"
	Turn it off.


0.	connect hearing aid to phone, then turn phone bluetooth off
1.	have Michael call
	2. show phone with ipad
	3. "I'm putting the hearing aid receiver up against an ipad microphone now, that's what’s recording the video and audio. The phone's bluetooth is off, so the hearing aid is only getting sound from the air. This is what a phone call sounds like NOT over Bluetooth."
	Ask Michael to read a chunk of text into the phone

	5. "Now I'm going to turn the phone's bluetooth on so that the hearing aid is getting sound through bluetooth. I’m still holding up the receiver to the ipad’s microphone so that you can hear what a phone call sounds like over bluetooth."
	6. Turn it on.
	7. "Now the hearing aid is connected to the phone through bluetooth, so we're going to listen to that same series of tones over the hearing aid's bluetooth connection.
