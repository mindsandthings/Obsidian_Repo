# Vertical heterophoria info

When symptoms occur after a TBI they are associated with post-concussion syndrome; when they occur after stroke they can cause post-stroke fatigue

[Problems with balance and binocular visual dysfunction are associated with post-stroke fatigue: Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation: Vol 24, No 1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10749357.2016.1188475)
Three components were extracted from the MFIS, explaining 71% of variance: Cognitive fatigue, Physical fatigue and Arousal. We found that women register higher MFIS scores than men. There was a strong association between the level of Cognitive and Physical Fatigue and BVD, between Arousal and balance and dizziness, and between Cognitive Fatigue and gait.

[Vertical Heterophoria and Postural Control in Nonspecific Chronic Low Back Pain](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018110)
The purpose of this study was to test postural control during quiet standing in nonspecific chronic low back pain (LBP) subjects with vertical heterophoria (VH) before and after cancellation of VH; also to compare with healthy subjects with, and without VH. Fourteen subjects with LBP took part in this study. The postural performance was measured through the center of pressure displacements with a force platform while the subjects fixated on a target placed at either 40 or 200 cm, before and after VH cancellation with an appropriate prism. Their postural performance was compared to that of 14 healthy subjects with VH and 12 without VH (i.e. vertical orthophoria) studied previously in similar conditions. For LBP subjects, cancellation of VH with a prism improved postural performance. With respect to control subjects (with or without VH), the variance of speed of the center of pressure was higher, suggesting more energy was needed to stabilize their posture in quiet upright stance. Similarly to controls, LBP subjects showed higher postural sway when they were looking at a target at a far distance than at a close distance. The most important finding is that LBP subjects with VH can improve their performance after prism-cancellation of their VH. We suggest that VH reflects mild conflict between sensory and motor inputs involved in postural control i.e. a non optimal integration of the various signals. This could affect the performance of postural control and perhaps lead to pain. Nonspecific chronic back pain may results from such prolonged conflict.

### Literature summary:
* Quercia et al (2015) reported that vertical heterophoria is found in dyslexics. 
* Matheron and Kapoula (2015) reported that VH is common in chronic pain patients. The same authors reported that low back pain patients do better with prism cancellation of their VH (2011).
* Rosner et al (2016) suggested that "Neutralizing prismatic lenses are an effective treatment of headache, dizziness and anxiety in patients with persistent post-concussive symptoms and VH. " 
* Asper et al (2015) stated that vertical yoked prisms did not affected horizontal phoria. Of course, vertical and horizontal prisms are in different directions.
* Dobie et al (2010) reported that "treatment of the vertical heterophoria with individualized prismatic spectacle lenses resulted in a 71.8% decrease in subjective symptom burden and a relative reduction in VHS-Q score of 48.1%. It appears that vertical heterophoria can be acquired from TBI."
* Jackson and Bedell (2012) reported "Prisms that reduced the phoria of subjects with vertical phorias > 0.75 pd reduced motion sickness symptoms in 2 of the 4 subjects tested." This is not a large 'n'. 
* Matheron and Kapoula (2008) reported that postural control is better in individuals with vertical orthophoria (VO).
* Graf et al (2003) reported that the time constant of vertical phoria adaptation to a prism was roughly 31 minutes. This is very fast ! 
* Kono et al (2002) reported that phoria adaptation is slower in patients with cerebellar disturbances. This result varies from an earlier paper of one of the authors of this page (Hain) suggesting the opposite for horizontal phoria adaptation.
* Maxwell and Schor (1994) reported that there were two types of short term phoria adaptation. Schor also was the author or coauthor on several other papers regarding spatial aspects of vertical phoria adaptation.
* Eskridge and Rutstein (1985) reported on vertical fixation stability and the effect of prism. 
### Summary:
Very little has been written about vertical heterophoria. There are several recent papers suggesting that vertical heterophoria can be acquired from TBI, and that treatment with prisms is helpful. More study of this is needed. Chicago dizziness and hearing has a  [visual vertigo specialist](https://dizzy-doc.com/cv/sorenson.html)  and we can evaluate for this condition.
Vertical phoria adaptation is fast (time constant of about 30 minutes). One would think that this response should not be due to durable changes in neural "wiring".
