# SF chiropractic places
Still need to check these for reviews
 
Check if in-network
 
PT and chiropractic care are covered. Massage therapy is covered if provided by a licensed chiro or PT as part of care, but not by itself. There are lots of in-network options for both (Once we hit our deductible the marginal cost of an in-network visit is ~$20 and an out-of-network visit is ~$60).
