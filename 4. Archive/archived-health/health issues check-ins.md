~Sat, Jun 19, 2021~
* vertical heterophoria dx! glasses amazing!
* headache Thurs Fri Sat maybe more
* am covering one eye a lot more often
* still have very bad headache though
* glasses not coming for 2 weeks
* very tired
* 

~Sun, Jun 13, 2021~
* Have continued wearing eyepatch over one eye occasionally. It really does help. 
* Extremely looking forward to optometrist appointment Wednesday. 
* TOS trigger points continue to help.
* I got my period after only a few hours of cramps. I am wondering if my last couple weird periods (where I had a lot of cramping mid-cycle) might have been due to the covid shot, since that's apparently a thing. 
* Was exposed briefly to cigarette smoke while on Ana's balcony assembling her shelves, without obvious lasting effects. 
* I took some potassium after getting home although I think the issue was actually that my mid back had rotated right again the way it so frequently does. 

~Sat, Jun 5, 2021~
* Feet seem to be better. Maybe problem is just that the other stuff dries them out for real and then they get super painful? We'll see what happens with them in the next couple days after I wore shoes. I'm going to wash them tonight and put on lotion. 
* Head was a lot better the first 4 days of the week then began bugging me especially after my bass lesson where I had to turn it and it hurt
* Restarted Muldowney. I think it or the stretches are aggravating my very lower back, and I need to go more gently on them.


~Sat, May 29, 2021~
* Trying restarting Muldowney from all the way level 1. 
* Just continuing to not feel great. Headachy, fuzzy. Lack of enthusiasm, depressed. 
* Having issues with a very fuzzy central inside part of neck. 
* Have been doing the arm pull up right ribs side but it overdid it and hurt left side
* worried DMSO makes fungus? but maybe not
* week 1 of antifungal now over.
* 

~Sat, May 22, 2021~
* Saw Dr. Blitshteyn. Was depressed at her. She said to try mestinon again after pushing me to simply the effects of going off it into a yes/no decision. She could have suggested another med, I guess? Also, she pushed for all the same things again - go off clonazepam, try acupuncture. The one new thing was she pushed me to raise my lyrica (because she thinks it will get me off the clonazepam). She also more directly implied that clonazepam cannot possibly be having any effect on me. It was exhausting and I want to stop seeing her. 
* Saw Jon May (psych np) again. I tell him everything's fine and he keeps me on my current meds, which is nice. I wish I could be honest with him (or other providers) and not fear I'm jeopardizing access to meds. 
* I want a fucking nap
* bad weird headache today, probably at shoulder bone left side caused. just so tired. 

~Sun, May 16, 2021~
* headache/neck ache, along with mid/low back pain. resumed the stretches from the back book. they relax me more but I seem to remember my body retaliating some like this inn the past too.
* breasts very hot and sore, but still no period. 
* 

~Sun, May 9, 2021~
* 2nd covid vaccine tues, mild symptoms
* Th-F-S premenstrual symptoms, cramping and pain, aggravated by lifting Maya a lot Friday and Saturday (which also caused swelling up under base of skull). Especially bad Sat-Sun pain all over, though trigger points helped. 
* After 2 days ibuprofen the thing under base of skull that's been making me lightheaded on standing let up finally
* Continuing to treat for athlete's foot

~Sat, May 1, 2021~
* After swinging Maya around a lot Wed(?) and putting together squirrel cage for tomatoes, I had bad inflammation in neck and head for a couple days
* Need to do a full trigger points again
* 


~Sat, Apr 24, 2021~
* Got period Thursday
* Did a full trigger points early in the week and it was extremely helpful
* Not feeling great now
* Henna'd hair so not doing DMSO now but earlier in week did it 2 days in a row and I think it was very helpful
* Tried mestinon again but it led to me being physically super tense that night, despite being extremely helpful during the day
* 

~Sat, Apr 17, 2021~
* Body messed up again. it went back in some but overall it is just messed up a lot
* Tried some diamox; don't do again, it made me feel very ill.
* need to get better at staying hydrated
* took ibuprofen multiple times for strained pain lower back
* 

~Sun, Apr 11, 2021~
* One eye open didn't help as much, don't know why
* Need to take more breaks
* Lower back was a mess today. idk why. 
* Really looking forward to new glasses in July
*

Summary/notes: 
One eye open: started doing this on theory that it was vertical heterophoria. it does seem to help very specifically with that right back of neck muscle, although it's possible that holding an eye shut tenses my muscles in the right way to compensate. It happens the same way when I just hold a hand over and eye, though, so I think maybe it is not. 
IIH/head pressure: I think the head pressure is usually not head pressure (at least at this point) but inflammation and/or specific nerves getting compressed. 
TOS trigger points: need to do more. however sometimes these have been getting too inflamed without the DMSO. 
Holding up facial muscles: helpful but haven't been remembering
Tendinitis (de q, arm, thumbs): fucked this up worse with the heavy drinking glass
Muldowney: managed to do this 5 of 6 days. 
Upcoming week plans: more one eye open. try to use DMSO twice a week, earlier in day so that it's dry by bed. 



~Sat, Mar 27, 2021~
Summary/notes: 
IIH/head pressure: this doesn't seem to be a big issue anymore
TOS trigger points: some
Holding up facial muscles: kind of forgot all week
Tendinitis (de q, arm, thumbs): have fucked up thumb with heavy glass and arm by carrying things. 
Muldowney: back on track at least. building up again.
Upcoming week plans:

~Sat, Mar 13, 2021~
Summary/notes: something clicked back into place and I feel better than I have for weeks.

IIH/head pressure: I think this might not be building up pressure now, don't know if it was before, but I think it is pretty clearly now mostly nerve tension or compression or something. 

TOS trigger points: need to do more, but only with DMSO

Holding up facial muscles: haven't done much

Tendinitis (de q, arm, thumbs): 

Muldowney: 

Upcoming week plans: 



~Sat, Feb 27, 2021~
Blurgh. Resurgence of athletes foot. Cramps (probably period) and felt like my ability to stay upright was melting and my base of neck was swollen and touching itself inside. Took ibuprofen a couple nights in a row, did DMSO daily for several days. Stretching on ball didn't help much. 

TOS trigger points did help and I should do a full one more. 

~Sat, Feb 20, 2021~

Reasonably good. Had some trouble sleeping due to couldn't tell, but related to leg tension? A resurgence of the bottoms of feet bruised behind the knees trigger points I had before.

Keep stresching on the ball and doing trigger points. 

~Sat, Feb 13, 2021~
Summary/notes: double pillow for propping up arm is helpful, keep doing it. 
IIH/head pressure: I think it's ok? May have had an allergic reaction to lentils or peppers in them or something

TOS trigger points: working on these has been helpful too
Holding up facial muscles: doesn't make as big a difference now
Tendinitis (de q, arm, thumbs): seems to be continuing to gradually get better
Muldowney: sort of skipped 2
Upcoming week plans: pillow, stretches, trigger points


~Sun, Feb 7, 2021~

Summary/notes: Complete crash over Brent / racism / me etc. 

IIH/head pressure: hurt a bunch but seems to have been mostly the pressure I think? but I don't know. 

TOS trigger points: need to do very badly

TOS exercises: none, delete

Holding up facial muscles: forgot

Tendinitis (de q, arm, thumbs): getting better I guess? 

Muldowney: stopped second half of week

Upcoming week plans: 



~Sat, Jan 30, 2021~
Summary/notes: started doing stretch back arms out exercise on the exercise ball and it is almost unbelievably helpful. Not completely, maybe? I do have to do it with my arms straight out, though, even if that isn't what hurts and doesn't feel like it's doing anything. 

Think I had some allergy issues with sleeping on sheets that had been bleached (and packed into the washer so they may not have thoroughly rinsed), so I'm rewashing them. 

Skipping DMSO for a few days seems to be fine with this but the effect may be limited. Not sure yet. 



IIH/head pressure: 
TOS trigger points: did. With the stretches, it doesn't seem to have had noticeable aftereffects!

TOS exercises: did not do

Holding up facial muscles: did some. 

Tendinitis (de q, arm, thumbs): 

Muldowney: 

Upcoming week plans: more regular stretches! 


~Sat, Jan 23, 2021~
Summary/notes: Increasingly thinking some of the "full" feeling really is from tight muscles. But. Who knows? Hard to tell. 

I think I need to look more into head pillows for at night

started DMSO again, doing both sinuses and back of neck

IIH/head pressure: see above

TOS trigger points: have still note done a full release

TOS exercises: nope

Holding up facial muscles: yes, this makes a big difference

Tendinitis (de q, arm, thumbs): eh

Muldowney: missed yesterday due to tiredness. Did do 2 times this week 40 seconds at the second level

Upcoming week plans: Muldowney. Add chest stretches. 



~Sun, Jan 17, 2021~

Summary/notes: bad headache still not sure what was up with,. probably set off by going up a level to Muldowney uppers

IIH/head pressure: urghj. can't tell if it was this or just nerve ?? muscle issues

TOS trigger points: did but didn't help

TOS exercises: did not do

Holding up facial muscles: stopped working when back of head swelled up

Tendinitis (de q, arm, thumbs): eh. not worse. maybe a little better

Muldowney: skipped half the week due to headache

Upcoming week plans: TOS full plus DMSO; Muldowney every day

~Mon, Jan 11, 2021~
Summary/notes: Wow, not a great week. Stress, then headache. Took some acetazolamide (or maybe that was last week?) and am somewhat better but it was not good. 

IIH/head pressure: has felt pretty bad sometimes. 

TOS trigger points: did a bunch but that may have triggered things as I was doing them without DMSO

TOS exercises: none

Holding up facial muscles: stopped being helpful when things got swollen enough

Tendinitis (de q, arm, thumbs): trying. a little less bad? stopping the nerve glides actually seemed to stop irritating the elbow issue. 

Muldowney: skipped half of week because pain


~Sat, Jan 2, 2021~
Summary/notes: Have been stroking the base of my skull rightwards like the Atlas guy does. It's helped a lot! But I may or may not have overdone it and created issues Thursday. 

Had brief cold(?) or the Thursday issues Th evening through Fri am. Sat was full of energy. 

Just generally feeling a LOT better since starting treatment for athletes foot (hands, crotch, head). Like, back to normal levels of energy. 

IIH/head pressure: Felt like it Th/F and maybe that was part of that thing

TOS trigger points: some. would benefit from doing a full workout every week or every 2-3 days.

TOS exercises: 

Holding up facial muscles: Need to do more!!

Tendinitis (de q, arm, thumbs): eh. may be getting better but very slowly

Muldowney: did do this

~Sat, Dec 26, 2020~
Summary/notes: Last Saturday's car ride without a headrest to see lights definitely fucked something up that did not start improving until Wednesday. However, Thurs or whenever the right side of the base of my skull popped into place, it *really* popped into place - in a way it hasn't been in months. I don't even know what exactly I did, other than a bunch of trigger point work directly prior! Wish I'd written it down right then.

IIH/head pressure: Sunday thought that was the problem and yeah it probably was, so took 1/8 acetazolamide. Thurs after it popped in for a while I thought it was going to keep swelling but instead it dissipated some. It's still something of an issue today but way way less, and the pain reduction compensates. 

TOS trigger points: did some prior to head going in. Feeling pretty good now after head going in and a few days of minimal to no writing. Did some trigger points prior to head going in and that helped. 

TOS exercises: none

Holding up facial muscles: have done some. Should probably do more. 

Tendinitis (de q, arm, thumbs): it's ok. have done fewer dishes since Allie did some. 

Muldowney: Skipped last few days due to pain. some of which was inflammation from athlete's foot issues probably. 


~Sat, Dec 19, 2020~
Summary/notes: Nothing seems to have gone out this week, at least nothing major. Maybe a sign of ongoing healing? I hope so. 

IIH/head pressure: last time was Dec 4, two weeks ago. It could be starting again, or it might not be; I don't think I can really tell. 

TOS trigger points: ad hoc, but really need a thorough run through

TOS exercises: not doing

Holding up facial muscles: is helpful. I wonder what relation of hearing aids pink noise muscle is to this. 

Tendinitis (de q, arm): de q and thumbs is worse from animal crossing. arms continues to slowly improve.

Muldowney: skipped one core this week due to feeling ill. 


~Dec 12~

Summary/notes: I don't think anything went out extensively this week except for my mid-neck getting rotated and having to set it back in twice. 

IIH/head pressure: doesn't seem to be much of a problem as long as I'm not exacerbating things and am doing trigger points. but it has still been a problem a couple times. 

TOS trigger points: have been working on these more regularly! including rib cage, which seems to be important too, not just the 10 TOS ones. however, it would still be good to do the TOS ones *regularly* for a couple weeks, all of them, and follow them with DMSO. 

these also seem to keep me from needing lots of manual adjustments, generally. 

TOS exercises: still on hold while doing triggers points

Holding up facial muscles: sometimes this seems extremely relevant and some times not but I think I should keep trying to do it very regularly, and reward myself

Tendinitis (de q, arm): duelingo on phone has made de quervains worse and am wearing brace again, sigh. Right elbow seems to be gradually getting better though. 

Muldowney: have been doing. haven't been doing the uppers every day though. 



~Dec 5~

Summary/notes: Thurs/Fri had increasing sense of head inflammation at base of skull, and pressure only partial-temporarily relieved by trigger points. Friday my sinuses became especially dry after a couple days of the left one feeling swollen (and one round of DMSO saline rinse). Friday evening took 1/8 acetazolamide, less pressure but still felt swollen; felt better after laying down on front before bed, but not fully recovered; Saturday gradually felt better. 
However, Saturday I also had serious painful abdominal cramping. I think Ana may have used butter in what I had Friday night. If I was allergic in something she used that I ate Thursday, that could explain the unusually bad head inflammation - although the rapid onset was immediately after eating very salty corn chips. 

IIH/head pressure: see above
TOS trigger points: did some but not any full sets
TOS exercises: did not do
Holding up facial muscles: did not work at all Thurs/Fri - felt too swollen to be helpful. 
Tendinitis (de q, arm): arm had some improvements though still noticeable when opening door handles or picking up dishes. 
Muldowney: at 1:50 for upper, I think. maybe 1:40. 

This week it would be good to do a thorough trigger point workout followed by DMSO. 


~Nov 28 list~

This week featured DMSO with magnesium, and the discomfort at the base of my skull being gone or nearly gone as a result. It also featured inflammation and nerve entrapment in my right hip. 

Ribs out of place/thing that gets rotated sideways - still going on. Continues to fall out fo place and I don't know hwy. 

First and second ribs - left side I can get to go easily. right side might be tangled up with the rotated sideways thing? I can't tell, but I don't think the very top part needs to go down like for the left side. 

IIH - haven't used acetazolamide for two weeks. I think magnesium + DMSO + trigger points miiiight have fixed this? Although I have had more than one night of draining sinuses.  

TOS trigger points - have been doing in bits and pieces as needed and especially after  putting magnesium on. Would be good to do more. 

TOS exercises - didn't work on

Holding up facial muscles - seems less necessary now. However I did find a new muscle that holds something down. 

Right elbow - still doing stretches/glides. trying not to lift with that arm. 

Thumbs/de quervain's - still doing exercises. Worse than last week due to too much gaming. 

Upper body exercise - barely managed 1:30 for rotators, but should probably keep at 1:20. 

Lower and other exercise - missed several days due to stress. 

~Nov 22 list~

This week featured probably-menstrual-cramps (Sun Nov 23). 
This week featured a thing finally going back into place that resolved my issues standing and with cramping esp abdomen on right side (and sternum), but that led to a 2-day headache on left upper neck. 

Ribs out of place/thing that gets rotated sideways - had some clear shoulder issues. wondering if what rotates up there isn't a rib, maybe it's a nerve or something that's outside the rib and gets stuck. 

First and second ribs - left side goes, though it feels high enough in my neck I wonder if it's really the rib. 

IIH - haven't used any acetazolamide in nearly a week and a half. maybe the trigger points plus DMSO are starting to be enough. 

TOS trigger points - have done these as needed, could probably stand to do more. 

TOS exercises - didn't do stretches. maybe going to wait for trigger points more. 

Holding up facial muscles - seems less necessary with trigger points

Right elbow - still doing stretches/glides. trying not to lift with that arm. 

Thumbs/de quervain's - still doing exrecises. not as bad as last week

Upper body exercise - tried to go to 1:20 for exterior rotations, had to keep at 1:10. 

Lower and other exercise - missed several days due to stress. 

__Nov 17 eval__

__Health - Nov 8 eval__

This week featured a thing finally going back into place that resolved my issues standing and with cramping esp abdomen on right side (and sternum), but that led to a 2-day headache on left upper neck. 

Ribs out of place/thing that gets rotated sideways - lower right fron sterum often feels out of place but not always. 

First and second ribs - have tried to put left back int place but it didn't go. Right side still hard to get any movement on. 

IIH - have been wearing hearing aids on setting 3/4 to keep upright but I think it's being tiring, or maybe it's the thing I'm doing that to correct that's tiring? hard to tell. worried if I make an appt for vertical heterophoria it'll be useless because the hearing aids fix my head tilt. also, used 1/8 acetazolamide twice this week, once Tues, once Sat(?). Still felt bad after using it Sat but it stopped the intense pressure issue (which I still wonder if is due to nerve compression). Used some DMSO but not so much. 

TOS trigger points - I did these again today (Tues) and have been looking after Maya yesterday and today instead of writing which may be helping. Defnitely TOS felt good today. 

TOS exercises - did stretches for a couple days but then left-side neck ache hit. Don't know if related. 

Holding up facial muscles - stopped being able to do this while headache - everything felt just too swollen for tensing them to do anything. not enough feedback. 

Right elbow - still doing stretches/glides, but continues to be fucked up. holding Maya isn't helping. I only did half of full can exercises and will not do biceps for a while. 

Thumbs/de quervain's - still doing exrecises. noticeably bad. to the extent it clicked twice a couple times. 

Upper body exercise - am at 1:10. It seemed to be ok today? but seems quite difficult for the exterior rotations. Other ones seem doable though. This is about the point I usually start having a lot of trouble though. 

Lower and other exercise - missed last few days due to headache. 

__Health - Oct 31 eval__

Ribs out of place/thing that gets rotated sideways - seems to have gone back to ok-ish, maybe following getting period

First and second ribs - maybe ok? can't tell. 

IIH - still on hold. think it may be primarily an inflammation issue that sometimes blocks drainage, since the inflammation in my head is still here even if my neck is mostly ok. if inflammation, I assume a repeat injury. but idk. could be if TOS is blocking vascular drainage and eventually CSF. 

Tackling inflammation - regular DMSO does seem to help! but then my neck gets leathery, and I don't like that. So I will attempt to start taking 2 days off. 

TOS trigger points - still seems very helpful! if inflammation-causing. but in general, good. although they seem to start back up very quickly, and require a lot of time to get to go away. 

TOS exercises - start stretches

Holding up facial muscles - continue trying regular reminders throughout the day. look into training and rehabilitation videos for same muscles. 

Right elbow - added regular stretches and nerve glides to exercises. have been doing a little more. 

__Health - Nov 8 eval__

Ribs out of place/thing that gets rotated sideways - lower right fron sterum feels pushed out of place always. 

First and second ribs - I've been putting the left side ones back into place I think. Right side is hard to get any movement on, especially since the lower right front sternum keeps feeling pushed out of palce already. 

IIH - The head swelling thing seems clearly helped by hearing aids on setting 3/4, because it makes me hold me head upright. I'm also looking into vertical heterophoria as a possibility. 

Tackling inflammation - still taking days off DMSO after ~4 days; neck is less thickened in general but can feel it after shower. Think when I was doing it just back of head, it still got on neck. 

TOS trigger points - hearing aid setting 3 and this week's mostly-break from writing may have done good things, but I should start doing these again. 

TOS exercises - going to start the first 4 stretches now that I have equipment

Holding up facial muscles - hearing aid seems to make this happen. still going to look into training and rehabilitation videos for same muscles. 

Right elbow - still doing stretches/glides, but continues to be fucked up. need to not do any biceps I think. 

Thumbs/de quervain's - still doing exrecises. made this worse by using phone to check news a lot.  

Upper body exercise - am at :50. have been doing bands daily, and the others on expected days. 

Lower and other exercise - have resumed. hooray!
