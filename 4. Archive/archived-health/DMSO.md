# DMSO

DMSO notes:
 - pain control lasts about 6 hours
 - apply once every 4 hours
DMSO tranports GABA across the blood-brain barrier


I read it's good to take a break from DMSO now and then. Suggestions were to not take it for a couple days a week, and to skip a couple weeks per year. I started not doing it over the weekends, and have noticed a couple of things. I feel a bit more relaxed when I give DMSO a break, but by the time I get into the second day, I start missing some of the energy DMSO gives me.

Regarding dosing, when applying my DMSO / Mag. Oil combination, I use one dropperful of DMSO, mixed with about 10 sprays of Mag. Oil. I rub it together in my hands (has a warming sensation), and then apply it to my lower back and neck and head area. I do this 3x / application; and do this twice a day

For migraines: 50%, about a tsp, in the pattern I've been doign it.

DMSO is highly effective in vascular headaches and in muscular tension which so often goes with headaches. It may be used on hairy areas such as the scalp and it also may be used near the eyes. A 90% solution is more effective (Ogden, 1967).
