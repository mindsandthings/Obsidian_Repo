Notes from 8/11/22 videochat

Most clients are really beginners. 

Be upfront that nobody knows what will be published. 

Their website is Avada (on Wordpress) - $60-70 and you own it outright. Steep leaning curve. 

Trust yourself. 

To ward off a difficult client, bump the cost up $300. If there's someone you'd really like to work with, you can lower it by the same amoutn. 

Suggestions for communicating:

- "I think you might be trying to do \[thing\]...but it isn't working"
- Pull examples from text to illustrate

Time commitment:

- Development - 1 straight read, 1 to add comments, 1 to proofread comments
- They do no more than 30 k/day, which takes 3-4 hours. no more than 10k/day for the second read, which takes 3-4 hours. 1 day to check comments, 2 days to write the letter. They say to schedule a followup within 2 months (but will do it if later, just with a warning they may not remember it well anymore)

How they did it:

- Clarion West --> 7 Seas --> put it on their Reedsy profile
- They're not doing much marketing but would think Facebook ads and more attention to their business page
- Writing groups on fb have promo days
- Freebies - like they just took a 3-day freelance article writing class that's a lead-in to a bigger course
- Guest articles, podcasts, etc

Notes plans:

Client relations and communication

tell me about the clients that you get for developmental editing. where do you get them from? what kinds of expectations do they have?

what do you do when a client seems to be looking for a stamp of approval rather than substantive feedback?

tell me about your communication process. maybe start with initial contact and setting expectations. I read the brief descriptions on your website for the editorial letter, page-by-page comments, and follow-up consultation.

how do you go about delivering bad news? for example, when someone thinks something is almost done but it has major structural issues and the sentence-level quality is far from being publishable

have you had to renegotiate with clients? how does that work?

have you had to handle any unhappy clients?

Time and effort allocation

how do you set out to do an in depth review vs a single review? do you ever start a single review and get distracted by all the things that need fixing?

how long does it take you to review a manuscript vs write a letter?

when I'm reviewing something I get details while reading it, but it takes a long time and usually more than one pass for the details to cohere into overall issues.

how do you separate an in-depth review from a single review?

is the goal to provide advice that could be used to make it publishable, or to provide advice that will cause the client to improve?

I'm thinking about the difference between bringing someone's work up to the next level, and

I looked at your fee structure and saw you had a two-tier standard/thrifty division and otherwise charged by word count. How do you account for when some manuscripts need a lot of work and others don't? Do you just put in the extra time for the

I saw you do coaching too

repeat clients?

how long does a job take you?

how many do you work with at a time?

Marketing, business, skills

How did you go about developing a marketing plan?

How much time did you spend on marketing early on? How has that changed?

Did you do a business plan?

What resources have you used for improving your developmental editing skills?

Final

what's surprised you about it?

How similar/different have you found developmental editing to be to critiquing in general?

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

To let you know where I'm at: my goal is to work part-time and write part-time. I'm looking at starting with copyediting or indexing or both; I'd need to take some classes to get up to speed on either. I suspect I would find developmental editing both rewarding and stressful, and am thinking of it as something I might branch out into later on, after I feel like I'm managing other aspects of freelancing effectively.
