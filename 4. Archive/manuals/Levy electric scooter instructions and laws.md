# Levy electric scooter instructions and laws


Electric scooter instructions, in case anyone needs to use it in an emergency where the car is not available (or wants to borrow it for a non-emergency):
* If it's an emergency you don't need to ask me before borrowing it
* Wear a helmet. I strongly recommend wearing gloves to keep from skinning your hands in case of a fall. (if you don't have bike gloves, even regular gloves will help)
* The batteries and charger are in the den because it's good to keep them at room temperature. (Against the far well as you enter. I will also keep the key for the bike lock here.)
* A battery charge is supposed to last ~9 miles. I have not tested this. I have a spare battery (too big to fit in a backpack) for longer trips. It takes 3 hrs to charge fully from empty. I've been keeping them at full although it's better to keep them at half-charge.
* To change the battery: press button on steering post and open cap. Turn thingy and pull it out. Pull battery out. Insert new battery (it will only go in in one orientation). Put thingy back in and turn it. Close cap. **Do not put thingy back in until the new battery is in—it can fall into the hole and get stuck and it's very hard to get out.**
* Adjust the mirrors before starting, they slide out of place
* To start: press power button; kick push; at 2mph press the lever with your thumb to engage the motor
* To change the speed settings, single tap the menu button on the throttle. Red D - caps at 15mph; gray D - caps at ~11mph; no D - caps at 5 or 6 mph
* When you brake, squeeze the brake plus step on the back wheel (helps it slow more effectively)
* There is a cruise control which you can turn on and it will activate after 7 seconds at a continuous speed. I have it turned off.
* To use it as a manual kick-push scooter, turn it off.
* Tires should be 50 PSI but inflating them is tricky and requires an extender for the front. They are pneumatic tubeless tires with Schrader (car-type) valves. If you get a leak you can fix it with tire slime - I have a small container in the garage
* There is a bike lock attached to the steering post. Press the button the side to get it out of the holder. Spare key is with the charger in the den.
* For more info search "Levy scooter" (regular scooter not pro).

California's electric scooter laws, the relevant bits summarized (specific locales may have more specific rules, but Fremont does not appear to have any, though SF does):
* Illegal to ride on the sidewalk, except for entering and leaving property as necessary. Don't park it on the sidewalk either
* Streets with speed limits >25mph: you must ride it in a class II bike path (bike lane marked with white lines) or class IV bike path (bike lane protected by physical barrier or raised pathway).
* Important note 1: You can't use the left-turn lane like a bike. You have to pull over to the right, get off, and walk it across a crosswalk like a pedestrian.
* Important note 2: a number of Fremont's roads have stretches where a bike path suddenly ceases to exist. If there's a sidewalk, I suggest dismounting and walking it on the sidewalk like a pedestrian.
* On streets with speed limits 25mph or under (e.g. all of Fremont's residential neighborhood streets): use a bike lane if available; otherwise, stay as close to the right-hand curb as possible. If it's a one-way street with two or more lanes, you have to ride as far on the left as possible (and for right-hand turns you must dismount and cross the road like a pedestrian).
* Signal appropriately when turning
* I've capped the speed at 15mph, which is the legal limit for scooters regardless of the speed limit
* At least one hand on the handlebars at all times, with no bags or items in the way
* No alcohol/drugs
* Must have a (regular) driver's license or learner's permit (and riders under 18 must wear a helmet. Adults are not required to wear a helmet per CA law, but you absolutely should wear a helmet anyway)
* No attaching yourself or the scooter to other vehicles
* No passengers
* Illegal to drive at night until I have appropriate lights and reflectors set up
