Electric scooter instructions, in case anyone needs to use it in an emergency where the car is not available (or wants to borrow it for a non-emergency):
* If it's an emergency you don't need to ask me before borrowing it
* The batteries and charger are in the den because it's good to keep them at room temperature. 
* A battery charge is supposed to last ~9 miles. I have not tested this. I have a spare battery (too big to fit in a backpack) for longer trips. It takes 3 hrs to charge fully from empty. I've been keeping them at full although it's better to keep them at half-charge. 
* To start: press power button; kick push; at 2mph press the lever with your thumb to engage the motor
* To change the speed settings, single tap the menu button on the throttle. Red D - caps at 15mph; gray D - caps at ~11mph; no D - caps at 5 or 6 mph
* When you brake, squeeze the brake plus step on the back wheel (helps it slow more effectively)
* There is a cruise control which you can turn on and it will activate after 7 seconds at a continuous speed. I have it turned off. 
* To use it as a manual kick-push scooter, turn it off. 
* Tires should be 50 PSI but inflating them is tricky and requires an extender for the front. They are pneumatic tubeless tires with Schrader (car-type) valves. 


The are certain steps you can take to extend the maximum life of your battery pack, including the following: 

    When not riding, keep your batteries at room temperature (60 - 80 degrees Fahrenheit). 
    Optimize for partial discharges instead of full discharges.  Charging your battery back up after it has reached 20 - 30% capacity is generally better than letting it go all the way to 0% before recharging. 
    If you are planning on not using your battery for longer than a month, store it at a ~50% charge.  Every 2-3 months thereafter, plug in your battery to ensure that it is maintained at this level and is not completely discharged.  


Like any vehicle, electric scooters will require periodic maintenance to ensure they are running properly and to prolong their lifespan. 

The most important task is to regularly check your tires to make sure they are properly inflated to at least 50 PSI.  Riding on low pressure is the most common cause for flats, leaks, and damage to the tire of the scooter.  We recommend checking the tire pressure at least once per week, similar to a frequently used bicycle. 

A less common maintenance task will be adjusting the brakes, whenever they start to feel loose or out of alignment. It's also important to keep the brake lines clean of debris and regularly lubricated to prevent corrosion if you are riding in wet environments (rain / snow).  

If you don't plan on using the scooter for more than 3 months - see our steps here for properly charging the battery for long term storage.
