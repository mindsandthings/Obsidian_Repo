# Hoffmann Fallen review

I was an early reader for this book (as well as the previous book in the series), and received an advance copy in exchange for a fair review.

Like the first book in the series, this is a clear, quick-moving read with compelling characters. Tiv and Yasira are back, along with a number of secondary characters from The Outside. I particularly enjoyed Hoffmann's secondary characters in The Outside, and I did here too; even characters with bit parts come alive. 

The Fallen takes place shortly after The Outside and focuses on a local resistance movement against the angels and on the personal aftermath of the events of The Outside. The characters are often in stressful situations where they have to make sacrifices and hard choicesm and the book does the serious nature of this justice: the sacrifices never feel taken lightly. 

Like The Outside, The Fallen also explores neurodiversity-relevant themes. The Outside contrasted Yasira and her mentor Ev's decisions about injustice and conflict, showing how the different societies they were raised in influenced their approaches. The Fallen focuses on small-scale person-to-person responses to neurodivergence: when someone finds out you're neurodivergent, do they respond with rejection? With acceptance and support? Or do they use support you can't get anywhere else in order to establish control over you? As an autistic and otherwise neurodivergent person, I particularly appreciate Hoffmann's exploration of the latter; it's a specific kind of abuse that happens in real life, but often not talked about. I think this is the first time I've seen it shown in fiction.
