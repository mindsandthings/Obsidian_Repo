# Margie course reviews

~Writing body language~
I took this course with Becky Rawnsley. Becky gave thoughtful, thorough, fine-grained feedback to me and other students, both on what we were doing effectively and what we could improve on. The feedback on what I was already doing effectively was particularly nice, since it's much easier for me to see what I don't like about my work than what I do!
The course lectures teach via extensive examples, with concepts introduced along the way, including some concepts that are expanded on in other courses. They're written by Margie Lawson with additional comments from Becky (for people who take it with Becky although I would guess Suzanne probably does the same). 
I took the course because I'd been advised by other critiquers to ground my dialogue more heavily in action and to show characters' emotions. I also knew I tended to overuse the same generic gestures and phrases. I had resources for body language and emotion vocabulary, but couldn't figure out how to put them into my work in ways that made sense. 
This class helped me do that effectively, and I would recommend it for other people seeking to do the same. Although the lecture notes are available as a standalone package, Becky's feedback to both me and other students helped me apply the knowledge I gained from lectures much more effectively than I would have otherwise, and I recommend taking it as a class.

~Empowering characters emotions~
This course made it much easier for me to figure out where a scene needs to be revised as well as to actually revise it. It helps you break a scene down into components (internalization, conflict, action, etc), look at how those components do (or don't) work together on the page, and get them to support each other effectively. It also helps you better write each component.

Since finishing the course I've revised two scenes on one project and written two scenes on another. Previously, it was difficult to narrow down what should go in each next sentence. I'd think of multiple possibilities and then go back and forth between them. Now I can look at the page, go "oh, this next bit needs action with a little bit of description followed by internals, and maybe I can turn some of the upcoming exposition into dialogue", write it, and move on. 

I took the course with Becky Rawnsley after previously taking Writing Body Language and Dialogue Cues with her. Becky gives thoughtful, thorough, fine-grained feedback, both on what students do well and on what we can improve on. Becky also helped make sure we were getting the key takeaways from each of Margie's lectures. 

Depending on how thoroughly you do the assignments and whether you do the optional assignments, the course can be a fair bit of work. I did some but not all optional assignments, and benefited from doing what I could. I recommend treating the class like a college course and budgeting time accordingly. The course lasted a month, with two to three lectures per week. As a rough estimate I'd say I spent 2-4 hours on each lecture and its assignments. 

If you're considering taking both this course and Writing Body Language and Dialogue Cues, I'd recommend taking this one first. It introduces topics covered more in-depth in the Writing Body Language course and places them in context.
