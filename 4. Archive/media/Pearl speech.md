# Pearl speech
I was going to drink a juice and wear these -- /ugh/ -- pants! And hit people gently enough as to not actually hurt them, and you'd say, "Wow, Pearl is really cool!" But /nooo/, instead, we drove to loud music, chased a mysterious woman into the night, and broke the law. Ugh, I've lost my edge. I should have stayed home with the puzzle.
