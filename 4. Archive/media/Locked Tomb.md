A— is Augustine the scientist, his little brother hedge fund manager is Alfred
M— is Mercymorn the doctor, her best friend nun is Cristobel
G— is G1deon, John’s “hometown boy,” and his only other friend was cop Pyrrha
C— is Cassiopeia the lawyer, and N— is Nigella the artist
and the only other “named” ones are U— and T—, the corpses who he starts calling Ulysses and Titania when he starts moving them around
bonus: a small part of me is convinced for some reason that when john actually fully resurrects ulysses after the nukes and everything, he will give him the soul of ulysses s. grunt, his nan’s dog for whom he renamed U—‘s corpse

also re who the name-censored folks in the john chapters are—i’ve found it helpful to remember that there were two “generations” of original lyctors. only the first gen, plus U and T’s original corpses, seem to be accounted for here. it seems now like only the first gen of original lyctors were resurrected from people john knew personally pre-nukes.
