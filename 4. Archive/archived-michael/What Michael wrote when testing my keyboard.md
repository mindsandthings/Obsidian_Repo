# What Michael wrote when testing my keyboard
Hi im elizabeth I write novels I am very cool with my two keyboards plus the extra hidden one I keep in reserve just in case things get too hot to handle. Which is never. Because of my 3 keyboards,. Its pretty  impressive, right? I'm not sure. 
Hi elizabeth, this is god. Could you et me a spaceship please? 
Forearms, what's up? This should be working well for you but it feels all kinds of uncomfortable. I should probably try one and see what happens longer term....
