# House measurements and details
 - Closets in guest room run most of the way of the room
 - E&A closet space (and does it have shelves?)
 - Which way does the door from the garage to the outside open on/swing? 
 - Do the closets have shelves? What is their clearance? - ours is 11.5" deep, 35.9" to ceiling

If we can't get enough storage in the garage, we need to arrange for storage instead of a couch or two.

I didn't measure the guest bedroom but I think it's on par with Elizabeth and Michael's bedroom and the den

    Parlor/dining room: 14.7' wide x 21.75' deep. There's a little jog that visually divides it into the parlor at the front (14.7' x 12.9') and dining room (14.7' x 8.8').
    Kitchen / entryway from driveway: ~13 wide x 10.3' deep.
    did not take a lot of measurements because not a lot of useful space here but we can put a table by the window.
    Breakfast nook/living room: 17.5 wide x 13.8' deep (actually a little deeper since it's contiguous with the kitchen). 
    Ground floor windows: in the parlor/dining room, the narrower ones are 34.5" from the floor, wider ones are 22.5" from the floor; I think this is true for the living room area too.

### Look up cost of wood / PVC at 1x6, 1x8, 1x10. PVC 1x7.25: $94.42 for 24 feet. $140.95 for 9.25 (24 feet).  MDF : 1x8 for 8 feet is $16.22 (24 feet: $48.66); primed, no painting required; can sag over time but can be mitigated by using it to spanno more thn three feet.
