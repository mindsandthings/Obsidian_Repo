in 2019? he suggested plurality and said it would be ok and he's probably even forgotten

I looked into it not because of that but because of something that came up while beta reading for someone else's book

different from what I'd learned about in the 90s

not able to remember across contexts

extremely clashing ways of thinking about the world

a way of conceptualizing myself

a framework

timeframe

server friends / sat night voice chats

what I want him to do or not:

I don't want him to do anything or to change how he treats me

(but I do)

why I'm telling him: he asked about the server friends

why I didn't tell him:

wanted to feel comfortable around myself

didn't want him to have access to it

didn't want to complicate relationship

a lot of it centered on our relationship

a lot of the memory stuff was specific to my interactions with him

didn't want to deal with him possibly doing the same and using it as an excuse - like the way he would be hot and cold around me

concerned you'd forget privacy and mention it to other peopleÂ 

generally, it gets impossible for me to relax if I think other people are going to not let me have privacy

gonna need a system convo around what specifically we tell him
