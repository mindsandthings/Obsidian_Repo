# Author characters talking article

 talking about stuff like they're independent, but not
context of "I tried to implement ___, but character wouldn't let me"
absence of the anticipated emotions one would normally feel
it's not your actual characters, it's a represenation of them in your head

[The echoes of getting evidence that something acts like a person, but not actually extending it to ask some obvious questions]

[The actual weirdest thing about this is that I've never heard it discussed as a writing technique.]

[the CW thing with the two ways of writing, charcter-first is not the same thing, but 

[curious about how editing characters affects this]

Of the 1486 guests invited to the festival across both years (including illustrators, artists, celebrities and public figures promoting books), a total of 181 writers (12%) took part in the survey

"Two raters (JF and AW) developed a set of descriptive codes from the dataset as a whole. Multiple iterations of the coding framework were discussed by the authors before the final version was applied to 20% of the dataset for independent coding by each rater. "

"Although ‘hearing’ the voices of characters and experiencing characters as agentive were both fairly common amongst writers within our sample, these experiences were also varied and complex. The descriptions provided by respondents highlighted the multiple ways in which a character might be ‘heard’, ‘talked to’, and experienced as exhibiting independence."

"Another potentially similar experience is reported in Alderson-Day et al.'s (2017) study of readers, in which nearly a fifth of respondents described unbidden experiences of characters outside the context of reading. While this ‘experiential crossing’ sometimes involved simulations of a character’s speech, it more frequently contained instances of ‘mindstyle’ (Fowler, 1977, Semino, 2007) – a term from cognitive stylistics which refers to the linguistic rendering of the worldviews and cognitive habits of a particular character – or the more general deployment of a character’s ‘consciousness frame’ (Palmer, 2004) – essentially a schema for the character’s perspective constructed during reading."

"Our results reveal a noticeable degree of heterogeneity which further research into this phenomenon should take into account. First, it would appear that while a small subset of writers do have pronounced experiences of their characters as entirely separate and self-determining agents, they are not particularly representative of writers’ experiences in general, not least because the agency and alterity of characters did not necessarily go hand in hand.
