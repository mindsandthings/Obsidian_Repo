Hi Jeanne,

Thanks for emailing me in regards to Elizabeth's application. 

I had the pleasure of attending the 2016 Clarion West six-week summer workshop with Elizabeth, and have also participated in a critique group with her post-Clarion. We are also both active members of several social Slack groups. 

Elizabeth was a fantastic member of the workshop. I found her critique to be insightful, measured, respectful and impeccably researched. Several of my classmates made comments about the thoughtfulness of Elizabeth's critiques after the first week of the workshop, and Elizabeth continued to impress as a classmate for the rest of the workshop.

Elizabeth takes great care to be sensitive to both the work and the author, particularly when the writer belongs to a marginalised group, or to several of these groups. I would consider Elizabeth to be an authority on accessibility, and I believe Clarion West has consulted with her in regards to making the classroom more accessible for future students. Elizabeth takes pride in her thoughtfulness, andspeaking a queer, neurodivergent, non-binary person, I personally greatly appreciated her empathy and care when critiquing. 

I can also testify to Elizabeth's resilience when receiving critique. I do not foresee any issues regarding Elizabeth receiving feedback, nor with her providing it to other members of the class. Elizabeth is organised, punctual, clear in her communication, and above all, respectful of other people. Her excellent communication skills are present in person and online. 

The Clarion West class of '16 was made up of folks from different backgrounds and marginalisations, and I heartily believe in Elizabeth's ability to be respectful, caring and supportive of her fellow workshop members. 

Elizabeth is a fantastic and talented person, and I am more than happy to endorse her as a valuable and kind member of any workshop group. 

I'd be happy to answer any further questions if they arise. 

Best of luck with your decisions!

Thanking you,

Emma Osborne
