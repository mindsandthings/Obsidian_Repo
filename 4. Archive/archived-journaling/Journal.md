* ### Woke up achy, read Reddit. Did exercises and morning chores. Submitted maintenance request for various sinks and the non-working stove burner.
* ### Postponed some big items until tomorrow or later.
* ### I'm worried about Karl being aggressive / jumping on Ana (she told me he did).
* ### I overfocused on writing and did not take breaks to play bass.
* ### In the evening I was achy and crashed.

* ### Have been pretty achy. Trouble getting together enough to do exercises so I can DMSO.
* ### Lots of reading Reddit. Really hoping the new glasses will help with pain and I'll just be able to do thigns again
* ### However, I revised the hearing aids article, wrote more than 1700 words, and finished pretty much everything on my to-do list
* ### And I did a bass practice
* ### Maya is waving hi to me now, it's very cute

### Wed, Jun 9, 2021
* ### Wrote a tl;dr of hearing aids article, worked the link to the twitter thread about APD community overlap with HOH community
* ### One week until my glasses appointment
* ### Cleaned the rags, cleaned the bathroom floors, washed the shower curtain, sprayed my shoes
* ### Ana made gumbo (yum) though we didn't have shrimp, and also made duck with potatoes. The duck fat was incredibly delicious.
* ### I read Reddit a lot in the morning and was achy and late getting started.
* ### Tomorrow I'm hoping to make endever* an inspirational quote
* ### I'm going to practice bass and get ready for bed. I wanted to do some free-writing but - okay, maybe I have time for 15 minutes.

* ### I got up and helped Allie distract Maya for a diaper change. Afterward Maya asked me for a hug (by coming up to me) for the first time I knew (she did it before but I didn't know that's what it was so I didn't pick her up).
* ### I managed a bass practice, but didn't do the primary work I intended to do (working on Andreas Brink nr6)
* ### I played I think over 2 hrs of Slay the Spire during the day, and played again 2 hrs at night. I have given the iPad back to Michael and asked him to hang onto it till he gets back from his trip in July.
