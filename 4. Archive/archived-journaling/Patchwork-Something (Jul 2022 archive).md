‚ÄúThey asked me to tell you what it was like to be twenty and pregnant in 1950 and when you tell your boyfriend you‚Äôre pregnant, he tells you about a friend of his in the army whose girl told him she was pregnant, so he got all his buddies to come and say, ‚ÄúWe all fucked her, so who knows who the father is?‚Äù And he laughs at the good joke‚Ä¶. What was it like, if you were planning to go to graduate school and get a degree and earn a living so you could support yourself and do the work you loved‚Äîwhat it was like to be a senior at Radcliffe and pregnant and if you bore this child, this child which the law demanded you bear and would then call ‚Äúunlawful,‚Äù ‚Äúillegitimate,‚Äù this child whose father denied it ‚Ä¶ What was it like? \[‚Ä¶\] It‚Äôs like this: if I had dropped out of college, thrown away my education, depended on my parents ‚Ä¶ if I had done all that, which is what the anti-abortion people want me to have done, I would have borne a child for them, ‚Ä¶ the authorities, the theorists, the fundamentalists; I would have born a child for them, their child. But I would not have born my own first child, or second child, or third child. My children. The life of that fetus would have prevented, would have aborted, three other fetuses ‚Ä¶ the three wanted children, the three I had with my husband‚Äîwhom, if I had not aborted the unwanted one, I would never have met ‚Ä¶ I would have been an ‚Äúunwed mother‚Äù of a three-year-old in California, without work, with half an education, living off her parents‚Ä¶. But it is the children I have to come back to, my children Elisabeth, Caroline, Theodore, my joy, my pride, my loves. If I had not broken the law and aborted that life nobody wanted, they would have been aborted by a cruel, bigoted, and senseless law. They would never have been born. This thought I cannot bear. What was it like, in the Dark Ages when abortion was a crime, for the girl whose dad couldn‚Äôt borrow cash, as my dad could? What was it like for the girl who couldn‚Äôt even tell her dad, because he would go crazy with shame and rage? Who couldn‚Äôt tell her mother? Who had to go alone to that filthy room and put herself body and soul into the hands of a professional criminal? ‚Äì because that is what every doctor who did an abortion was, whether he was an extortionist or an idealist. You know what it was like for her. You know and I know; that is why we are here. We are not going back to the Dark Ages. We are not going to let anybody in this country have that kind of power over any girl or woman. There are great powers, outside the government and in it, trying to legislate the return of darkness. We are not great powers. But we are the light. Nobody can put us out. May all of you shine very bright and steady, today and always.‚Äù

The Lives of Ancient Roman Women

www.youtube.com

The lives of ancient Roman women and the exact roles played by them both in ancient Rome and all throughout the ancient world are pretty obscure, due to the focus of both the ancient male writers, and the nineteenth and twentieth-century male scholars, who largely ignored them. It has only been recently that modern scholarship has begun working to demystify the lives of women from biassed source material written by men. By looking objectively at the ancient evidence concerning women in ancient Rome, we are getting a clearer and clearer picture of their rights, duties, status, and daily lives.

Women were pretty restricted in public life, they couldn‚Äôt attend, speak at, or vote in political assemblies and they couldn‚Äôt hold any position of political authority. Some women were able to influence public affairs through their husbands, but this wasn‚Äôt too common. Lower-class women had more of a public life, since they had to work for a living, with common jobs undertaken by women being in agriculture, markets, crafts, as midwives or as wet-nurses. Some places women were allowed to attend though included the theatre, public spectacles, including gladiatorial games, and Roman public baths. Some women, in fact, participated in the games at the Coliseum as gladiators and, although they might become celebrities, they were still looked down on as lower class.

Did you know? The reason citation in APA use only initials and not full names is because some women ran an experiment. They submitted some articles they‚Äôd written to a journal and the articles were rejected. They changed nothing about the articles except the authors‚Äô names, which they changed to male names, and resubmitted them. The articles were accepted.

It‚Äôs remarkable how hostile diversity-friendly spaces are getting toward autistic people, and it‚Äôs depressing and frightening seeing neurodiversity spaces get taken over by sociopath- and narcissist-defending points of view. I‚Äôm considering going back to exclusively mainstream spaces to be safer, which is impressive since mainstream spaces were formerly the primary sites of abuse and have not gotten less dangerous. It‚Äôs just that the refuges and havens are managing to get even more dangerous.

I wish neurodiversity communities could just declare this a case of competing access needs and have \*separate communities\*, instead of making primarily-autistic spaces into hunting grounds.

Sure am seeing an uptick in ‚Äúpeople with NPD and ASPD are part of neurodiversity, just like autistic people!‚Äù I hope the within-community backlash hits before things get bad enough for the backlash from outside.

Intention matters, and capacity for recognizing other people as full people matters.

A while ago, I read a book with a nonbinary main character, a cowboy (cowperson?) in an alternate-history Weird West. I loved it; I kept being like ‚Äúit‚Äôs amazing to see a portrayal of someone allowed to be the way they are.‚Äù

In the second or third book, he began identifying as a man. And my frame of reference flipped. It became painfully obvious he was just an incredibly stereotyped cowboy archetype.

patchwork-something

The social model of disability is sometimes used as a means of justifying the idea that everything bad that happens to you is someone else‚Äôs fault, and there is nothing radical or revolutionary or ground-breaking about that.

(Side note: the ‚Äúmedical model‚Äù is not a model anyone actually endorses. It is something that proponents of the social model use to describe the viewpoints of people they oppose.)

patchwork-something

long covid means the disability community is about to become more of a chronic illness community, and I honestly hope that happens. I have seen a lot of prominent disabled activists who really, really do not understand that sometimes the thing creating problems for you is literally your own body, and that sometimes it can really make you so miserable that being alive becomes a punishment. Maybe we could come up with a way to prevent mistreatment of disabled people while also understanding that some disability is extremely unwanted, for legitimate reasons, by the people who actually have it?

I just get so angry when I think about that.

patchwork-something

It‚Äôs disengenuous to pretend that people aren‚Äôt taking into account probability when making decisions about risk.

patchwork-something

I feel like I‚Äôve been trapped into acting in feminized ways due to trauma inflicted on me that wouldn‚Äôt have been inflicted if I weren‚Äôt female

and the kinds of things I want to do, the ways I want to act, are being done by cis men and trans women

because they are not forced to attend to the same things I am and thus have the luxury of pretending they do not exist

patchwork-something

maybe long covid will finally get people in general to understand just how much certain kinds of chronic illness really fucking suck. maybe it will even get the disability community to realize that certain kinds of disability really fucking suck.

patchwork-something

sometimes I feel like my whole life involves other people trauma-gatekeeping identity so they can try to maintain clear discrete boundaries and classify everyone as either 100% ingroup or 100% outgroup member with completely distinct and exclusively privileged experiences

patchwork-something

Before Fall‚Äôs identity was publicized, a whole lot of people bounced off the story very hard. Now that everyone knows the author is a trans woman, I only see people saying they love it. I find it frankly kind of horrifying that identity categories determine the reception of a story, and what it‚Äôs acceptable to say about a story, to that degree.

The Helicopter Story

When I read the helicopter story, it felt like I was being trolled. I‚Äôve had the experience sometimes of someone deciding that nonbinary, autistic, etc etc me would be a good person to cast as a stand-in for Square Boring Normie Culture so they can enact a scripted play in which they flood a space with hyperstimuli they‚Äôve designed to provoke a disgust reaction, and then when I respond badly to being trolled, they go ‚Äúoppressor!‚Äù to me and ‚Äúhaha, I grossed out the normie‚Äù to their peers.

That is what it felt like. I am not remotely surprised that the trans community was highly split on the story and a lot of them suspected a troll. The story evoked negative reactions in a large number of trans (and non-trans) readers, and when there is no other information available about a story or the author‚Äôs intent, people will infer intent from the story.

It hasn‚Äôt missed me that a lot of the people who had a similar reaction to the story were AFAB trans and NB people, or that the story‚Äôs protagonist was AFAB. Maybe, just maybe, it‚Äôs not a great idea to use someone of a different birth assignment as a metaphor for your own gender-related experiences. (I have seen exactly one person making this point, and I don‚Äôt know why I haven‚Äôt seen more. I don‚Äôt, by the way, mean that no one should ever identify with the gender-related experiences of someone with a different birth assignment; I mean that you should not deliberately invent a fictional person of a different birth assignment in order to represent your own experiences, any more than, say, you should invent a fictional person with a real-world disability you do not have to serve as a metaphor for your own experiences. There are real people with those experiences, and they would like to not be overwritten.)

The discourse surrounding the story is being fit into a ‚Äúthe internet attacks a trans woman for writing about her experiences of gender‚Äù frame, but some of the nuances are actually relevant here.

(And no, no one deserves to get harassment. Fall did not deserve harassment. The writers being harassed by legions of troll accounts right now - the three highest-profile of them being, incidentally, Black and Asian AFAB writers - likewise do not deserve harassment.)

I suspect a lot of the troll activity is deliberately attacking POC writers in order to 1) attack POC and 2) drive a wedge between POC writers and trans people.

Listening to the podcast Fucking Cancelled. It addresses a really important topic, and the authors are extremely brave, and without taking away from either of those I wish it focused more on addressing the concerns that people who are in cancel culture have about trying to come up with alternatives. Like:

How do I keep from being exploited from people who are trying to create alternatives only because they have actually committed serious abuses and are trying to form a new community in which they will be free to predate?

How do I deal with the fact that issues that determine whether I can participate in a community or not may be seen as ‚Äúdistractions‚Äù by other people in those communities? How do I deal with the fact that this is true for other people as well? We‚Äôre all coming from a culture in which the benefits go to whoever defects from solidarity the quickest and the most loudly, and in that culture‚Äîlike in anything we might try to replace it with‚Äîthe reward for being prosocial is self-sacrifice.

If the goal is to replace everything else with a class consciousness where we all unite against the rich, what does that mean for me, personally?

I am having useful thoughts.

patchwork-something

I ran across an article I‚Äôd read before. It describes my experience with a specific aspect of autism very well. I‚Äôd never seen it described anywhere before, and it really resonated with me. I posted it to a group of friends.

Several were triggered because the article talked about experiences they didn‚Äôt have instead of the ones they did, and had a very ‚Äúthis is morally offensive‚Äù response. I decided at that point not to participate in that group again. I‚Äôd completely blocked that memory until now, even though it couldn‚Äôt have been more than a couple years ago.

That group was really healthy for me until it was not. I miss what we had and don‚Äôt have anymore. I wish we had a cultural norm of saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not my experience, but I‚Äôm curious to hear what speaks to you about it.‚Äù Something where we could engage in information exchange instead of just defining people‚Äôs experiences as immoral for not being other people‚Äôs experiences.

If I had not broken the law and aborted that life nobody wanted, they would have been aborted by a cruel, bigoted, and senseless law. They would never have been born. This thought I cannot bear. What was it like, in the Dark Ages when abortion was a crime, for the girl whose dad couldn‚Äôt borrow cash, as my dad could? What was it like for the girl who couldn‚Äôt even tell her dad, because he would go crazy with shame and rage? Who couldn‚Äôt tell her mother? Who had to go alone to that filthy room and put herself body and soul into the hands of a professional criminal? ‚Äì because that is what every doctor who did an abortion was, whether he was an extortionist or an idealist. You know what it was like for her. You know and I know; that is why we are here. We are not going back to the Dark Ages. We are not going to let anybody in this country have that kind of power over any girl or woman. There are great powers, outside the government and in it, trying to legislate the return of darkness. We are not great powers. But we are the light. Nobody can put us out. May all of you shine very bright and steady, today and always.‚Äù

The Lives of Ancient Roman Women

www.youtube.com

The lives of ancient Roman women and the exact roles played by them both in ancient Rome and all throughout the ancient world are pretty obscure, due to the focus of both the ancient male writers, and the nineteenth and twentieth-century male scholars, who largely ignored them. It has only been recently that modern scholarship has begun working to demystify the lives of women from biassed source material written by men. By looking objectively at the ancient evidence concerning women in ancient Rome, we are getting a clearer and clearer picture of their rights, duties, status, and daily lives.

Women were pretty restricted in public life, they couldn‚Äôt attend, speak at, or vote in political assemblies and they couldn‚Äôt hold any position of political authority. Some women were able to influence public affairs through their husbands, but this wasn‚Äôt too common. Lower-class women had more of a public life, since they had to work for a living, with common jobs undertaken by women being in agriculture, markets, crafts, as midwives or as wet-nurses. Some places women were allowed to attend though included the theatre, public spectacles, including gladiatorial games, and Roman public baths. Some women, in fact, participated in the games at the Coliseum as gladiators and, although they might become celebrities, they were still looked down on as lower class.

Did you know? The reason citation in APA use only initials and not full names is because some women ran an experiment. They submitted some articles they‚Äôd written to a journal and the articles were rejected. They changed nothing about the articles except the authors‚Äô names, which they changed to male names, and resubmitted them. The articles were accepted.

patchwork-something

I think there;‚Äôs this idea that something is supportive ONLY if it supports \*only\* one specific group and does not help anyone else because if it helps other people then somehow it‚Äôs not helping the specific group

and I just. don‚Äôt know. what to do with that. I actually want to help people in general more than I want to fuck over out-groups

and one way I can do that is by supporting a specific group (disabled people) and showing how benefiting that group benefits other people

but we gotta be pure or something I guess. only things that ONLY help disabled people are support for disabled people or something

patchwork-something

so much of the advocacy I want to do is built around ‚Äúthis is something that benefits everybody‚Äù, and around finding common ground

and finding common ground is so often seen as a literal aggression, an insult

and in the face of that why would I want to try to do anything

patchwork-something

\*reads twitter\*

\*screams into the void\*

why. why must we do social justice in this specific way

I've been thinking a lot these days about collateral.

A really common trend, not just here on the blue hellsite but literally everywhere in life, is that when people point out the harmful consequences of some rhetorical tack or other, the response is "oh but I didn't mean you, I meant -"

And it's often said with a certain amount of impatience or frustration, like this should be obvious.

patchwork-something

I‚Äôm just so tired. There‚Äôs so much bullshit and no one can do anything about it and it‚Äôs increasingly the same shit in every space I have open to me. Even the normie spaces.

I am exhausted.

patchwork-something

I don‚Äôt think I remember ever feeling like I had to be this utterly paranoid not just toward potential abusers in social situations, but toward average / good people. Like the environment is laden with triggers performed by good people in the name of justice, plus at any moment one of those triggers could turn out to be not just a trigger but a new instance of actual trauma.

This all feels bizarrely like a certain kind of YA dystopia, in that my objective circumstances are better than I have any right to expect (disabled, can‚Äôt work, but not living in poverty) but everything‚Äôs bad right under the surface.

I don‚Äôt know how I can do anything creative when a situation consists of relentless bullying tendencies always looking for an opening, as though they‚Äôre anthropomorphic parasites taking over.

I can forget about it for a little while to focus on my projects but then it comes back and my ability to do anything coherent breaks down and I spend long periods of time staring at the screen.

patchwork-something

I do need a project; I can‚Äôt just drop the big project and expect everything to be okay, because it‚Äôs been an ongoing clusterfuck of self-dysregulation. (Of course, I dropped the project because it, too, was causing an ongoing clusterfuck of self-dysregulation.)

I cared about this project. I don‚Äôt think I will care about its replacement. I feel very sad about that. I am also sad that anything I care enough about to actually do seems to eventually get hijacked into being a trauma vector.

patchwork-something

watching other people gently attempt fawning in an attempt to be able to stay in their space and be seen as One Of The Good Ones and get shut down for not centering other people is...something

patchwork-something

I see people who are ostensibly like me just...casually posting about social connections, and casually relating to the world in a way that suggests that their experiences of existing are, in fact, quite different.

patchwork-something

I‚Äôm not sure what to say in real life about what my communities are doing, or about the way it contributes to my inability to talk about things, or about the way that it just turns into a whirlwind of death from a thousand cuts. I can‚Äôt even talk about it, because it just makes me sound insane/bitter/whatever word we want to use to victim blame without being seen as doing that.

It‚Äôs a complicated grief process and I can‚Äôt actually do much to get through it because there‚Äôs no better world in which I can get support for the fact that these things are actually happening.

patchwork-something

It‚Äôs mindblowing the amount of sabotage people are willing to employ to prevent others from contributing anything of value to a group, workplace, community, society, and/or humanity.

patchwork-something

The reduction of allyship to ‚Äúwants a cookie‚Äù and ‚Äúattempted white savior‚Äù mocks and attacks people who care about justice and want the world to be better. There is something deeply horrible about that.

You can feel that someone could better direct their energies without shaming them for having those energies at all, and without trying to guilt them into doing something that they do not have the skills or ability to do. I am not equipped to make my conservative relatives become liberals, and that is not fungible with ways of helping I can actually do.

patchwork-something

Trigger lists that are all words contribute to the notion that triggers are topics and never patterns of behavior

If the problem was people being conflict averse, the solution should be to encourage conflict. Instead, we‚Äôre being asked to keep disagreements in a separate space so that no one has to see any opposing opinions if they don‚Äôt want to. We‚Äôre being asked to be more conflict averse.

I feel bad for any of the mods who are hanging on but don‚Äôt agree with how this is being handled, and bad for anyone in the space who is baffled by how this is playing out.

There‚Äôs so much speculation I could engage in. Like, I kind of wonder if there‚Äôs a small group of people running around behind the scenes reporting everything they don‚Äôt like or something.

The drawbacks of anger, and some alternatives

A lot of things that are normal aren‚Äôt ok. It‚Äôs hard to notice this. We‚Äôre socialized to accept a lot of things that really ought to be unacceptable. When we try to object, we‚Äôre punished. Being punished for objecting is often humiliating and disorienting.

It‚Äôs hard to remember that these things are wrong even when others punish you for saying so. It‚Äôs hard to remember that you have rights when others act like you don‚Äôt.

One way to remember that things are wrong is to get angry about them. Feeling outraged can make it easier to hold onto your sense that, no, this isn‚Äôt ok, and yes, it is ok to object.

Unfortunately, the price of rage is high. Rage hurts. It‚Äôs physically unpleasant, physically exhausting, emotionally draining, and makes it hard to think clearly. The physical and emotional exhaustion from anger makes it harder to do other things. The fog of anger can lead to mistakes that make it harder to remember after the fact that you were justified in objecting. Rage is better than nothing, but there are other strategies that don‚Äôt hurt as much.

One thing that can help is to develop your understanding of the situation over time. If you learn to understand what you‚Äôre angry about and why, it can make it possible to use understanding rather than anger to stay oriented.

Questions like these can help:

What am I angry about?

Why am I angry about that?

What happened that I think is wrong?

Why do I think it‚Äôs wrong?

For instance, say I‚Äôm in class, we‚Äôre doing an activity, I‚Äôm not able to do the activity, and I‚Äôm feeling angry. We‚Äôre writing thoughts on big paper, and I can‚Äôt do handwriting well enough to participate. In that situation, I might think:

Why am I angry?

I‚Äôm trying to participate and failing over and over and that‚Äôs intensely frustrating.

Why am I angry about that?

Because I‚Äôm sick of being left out all the time.

What happened that I think is wrong?

The teacher knew about my disability and didn‚Äôt do anything to accommodate it when they planned the activity.

When I pointed out that I couldn‚Äôt participate, they didn‚Äôt do anything to fix it.

Why do I think that‚Äôs wrong?

Because I have a right to be here, and the teacher is supposed to be teaching me.

I‚Äôm a student here, and I have the right to learn the material and be part of the activities we‚Äôre using to learn it.

This is disability discrimination, and that‚Äôs wrong.

Then, the next step in using understanding rather than anger is to notice that something is wrong before you start feeling enraged. Sometimes that can make it possible to fix the problem without having to get to the point of outrage. It can also make it more possible to decide when to fight and when not to.

For instance, take the class activity. If I remember that I have the right to be there and that it‚Äôs the teacher‚Äôs responsibility to teach me, this might happen:

I go to class and see that there is big paper on the walls.

I remember that I can‚Äôt do big paper activities.

I remember that I have the right to participate in educational activities.

I remember that I have the right to learn the material.

I ask right away ‚ÄúAre we doing a big paper activity today? How will I participate?‚Äù

At this point, I‚Äôm annoyed, but not outraged, and able to assert something without it hurting so much.

They may or may not respond the right way ‚Äî and I might still get really angry. But if that happens, I can repeat the strategy again, figure out what I‚Äôm angry about and why. Then I can get further without depending on anger the next time. (Even when you can‚Äôt win or fix the problem, it‚Äôs still often possible to use that kind of strategy to stay oriented without rage. I have more posts in the works about that specifically.)

Anger isn‚Äôt a failure. It‚Äôs ok to be angry when unacceptable things are happening. It‚Äôs also ok \*not\* to feel physically angry. Anger hurts, and you don‚Äôt owe anyone that kind of pain. You don‚Äôt have to be pushed to the point of rage in order to be justified in objecting to unacceptable things.

Sometimes it might help to explicitly remind yourself of this. Some affirmations that have sometimes worked for me:

I don‚Äôt have to hurt myself to prove that this is wrong.

It‚Äôs still wrong if I‚Äôm calm.

It‚Äôs still wrong if I‚Äôm not crying and shaking.

It‚Äôs still wrong if my heart isn‚Äôt pounding.

Even if I‚Äôm ok, the situation isn‚Äôt ok.

Even if I‚Äôm ok in this moment, it‚Äôs ok to object to a situation that‚Äôs hurting me and/or others.

It also helps not to beat yourself up for getting angry. Anger in the face of outrageous things isn‚Äôt a failure. No strategy can completely replace physical outrage for anyone. Holding yourself up to impossible standards won‚Äôt help. Working on your skills at staying oriented in other ways will.

These strategies are harder to learn and harder to use. They also make it a lot more possible to resist and stay oriented without hurting yourself. It‚Äôs not all or nothing ‚Äî any skills in this area help, and it gets easier with practice.

Allyship does not mean seeing yourself as worthless

There are people who like to make others feel worthless. Some of them use the language of social justice to get away with it.

Often, this comes in the form of proclaiming to hate allies and then demanding unbounded deference from allies. This is typically conflated with accountability, but it‚Äôs not the same thing at all.

Hatred and accountability are different things. Accountability as an ally means, among other things:

Listening to the people you‚Äôre trying to support instead of talking over them.

Making good-faith efforts to understand the issues involved and to act on what you learn.

Understanding that you‚Äôre going to make big mistakes, and that sometimes people you‚Äôre trying to support will be justifiably angry with you.

Accepting that your privilege and power matter, not expecting others to overlook either, and taking responsibility for how you use both.

Facing things that are uncomfortable to think about, and handling your own feelings about them rather than dumping on marginalized people.

Being careful about exploitation and reciprocity, including paying people for their time when you‚Äôre asking them to do work for you.

Understanding that marginalized people have good reason to be cautious about trusting you, and refraining from demanding trust on the grounds that you see yourself as on their side.

When people use the language of social justice to make others feel worthless, it‚Äôs more like this:

Telling allies explicitly or implicitly, that they are worthless and harming others by existing.

Expecting allies to constantly prove that they‚Äôre not terrible people, even when they‚Äôve been involved with the community for years and have a long track record of trustworthiness.

Berating allies about how terrible allies are, in ways that have no connection to their actual actions or their actual attitudes.

Giving people instructions that are self-contradictory or impossible to act on, then berating them for not following them.

Eg: Saying ‚ÄúGo f**ing google it‚Äù about things that are not actually possible to google in a meaningful way

Eg: saying ‚Äú shut up and listen to marginalized people‚Äù about issues that significant organized groups of marginalized people disagree about. https://www.realsocialskills.org/blog/the-rules-about-responding-to-call-outs-arent

Eg: Simultaneously telling allies that they need to speak up about an issue and that they need to shut up about the same issue. Putting them in a position in which if they speak or write about something, they will be seen as taking up space that belongs to marginalized people, and if they don‚Äôt, they will be seen as making marginalized people do all the work.

Giving allies instructions, then berating them for following them:

Eg: Inviting allies to ask questions about good allyship, then telling them off for centering themselves whenever they actually ask relevant questions.

Eg: Teaching a workshop on oppression or a related issue, and saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs not my job to educate you‚Äù to invited workshop participants who ask questions that people uninformed about the issue typically can be expected to ask.

More generally speaking: setting things up so that no matter what an ally does, it will be seen as a morally corrupt act of oppression.

Holding allies accountable means insisting that they do the right thing. Ally hate undermines accountability by saying that it‚Äôs inherently impossible for allies to do anything right. If we want to hold people accountable in a meaningful, we have to believe that accountability is possible.

Someone who believes that it‚Äôs impossible for allies to do anything right isn‚Äôt going to be able to hold you accountable. If someone has no allies who they respect, you‚Äôre probably not going to be their exception ‚Äî they will almost certainly end up hating you too. If someone demands that you assume you‚Äôre worthless and prove your worth in an ongoing way, working with them is unlikely to end well.

If you want to hold yourself accountable, you need to develop good judgement about who to listen to and who to collaborate with. Part of that is learning to be receptive to criticism from people who want you to do the right thing, even when the criticism is hard to hear. Another part is learning to be wary of people who see you as a revenge object and want you to hate yourself. You will encounter both attitudes frequently, and it‚Äôs important to learn to tell the difference. Self-hatred isn‚Äôt accountability.

Tl;dr If we want to hold allies accountable in a meaningful, we have to believe that accountability is possible. Hatred of allies makes this much harder.

‚ÄúThey asked me to tell you what it was like to be twenty and pregnant in 1950 and when you tell your boyfriend you‚Äôre pregnant, he tells you about a friend of his in the army whose girl told him she was pregnant, so he got all his buddies to come and say, ‚ÄúWe all fucked her, so who knows who the father is?‚Äù And he laughs at the good joke‚Ä¶. What was it like, if you were planning to go to graduate school and get a degree and earn a living so you could support yourself and do the work you loved‚Äîwhat it was like to be a senior at Radcliffe and pregnant and if you bore this child, this child which the law demanded you bear and would then call ‚Äúunlawful,‚Äù ‚Äúillegitimate,‚Äù this child whose father denied it ‚Ä¶ What was it like? \[‚Ä¶\] It‚Äôs like this: if I had dropped out of college, thrown away my education, depended on my parents ‚Ä¶ if I had done all that, which is what the anti-abortion people want me to have done, I would have borne a child for them, ‚Ä¶ the authorities, the theorists, the fundamentalists; I would have born a child for them, their child. But I would not have born my own first child, or second child, or third child. My children. The life of that fetus would have prevented, would have aborted, three other fetuses ‚Ä¶ the three wanted children, the three I had with my husband‚Äîwhom, if I had not aborted the unwanted one, I would never have met ‚Ä¶ I would have been an ‚Äúunwed mother‚Äù of a three-year-old in California, without work, with half an education, living off her parents‚Ä¶. But it is the children I have to come back to, my children Elisabeth, Caroline, Theodore, my joy, my pride, my loves. If I had not broken the law and aborted that life nobody wanted, they would have been aborted by a cruel, bigoted, and senseless law. They would never have been born. This thought I cannot bear. What was it like, in the Dark Ages when abortion was a crime, for the girl whose dad couldn‚Äôt borrow cash, as my dad could? What was it like for the girl who couldn‚Äôt even tell her dad, because he would go crazy with shame and rage? Who couldn‚Äôt tell her mother? Who had to go alone to that filthy room and put herself body and soul into the hands of a professional criminal? ‚Äì because that is what every doctor who did an abortion was, whether he was an extortionist or an idealist. You know what it was like for her. You know and I know; that is why we are here. We are not going back to the Dark Ages. We are not going to let anybody in this country have that kind of power over any girl or woman. There are great powers, outside the government and in it, trying to legislate the return of darkness. We are not great powers. But we are the light. Nobody can put us out. May all of you shine very bright and steady, today and always.‚Äù

The Lives of Ancient Roman Women

www.youtube.com

The lives of ancient Roman women and the exact roles played by them both in ancient Rome and all throughout the ancient world are pretty obscure, due to the focus of both the ancient male writers, and the nineteenth and twentieth-century male scholars, who largely ignored them. It has only been recently that modern scholarship has begun working to demystify the lives of women from biassed source material written by men. By looking objectively at the ancient evidence concerning women in ancient Rome, we are getting a clearer and clearer picture of their rights, duties, status, and daily lives.

Women were pretty restricted in public life, they couldn‚Äôt attend, speak at, or vote in political assemblies and they couldn‚Äôt hold any position of political authority. Some women were able to influence public affairs through their husbands, but this wasn‚Äôt too common. Lower-class women had more of a public life, since they had to work for a living, with common jobs undertaken by women being in agriculture, markets, crafts, as midwives or as wet-nurses. Some places women were allowed to attend though included the theatre, public spectacles, including gladiatorial games, and Roman public baths. Some women, in fact, participated in the games at the Coliseum as gladiators and, although they might become celebrities, they were still looked down on as lower class.

Did you know? The reason citation in APA use only initials and not full names is because some women ran an experiment. They submitted some articles they‚Äôd written to a journal and the articles were rejected. They changed nothing about the articles except the authors‚Äô names, which they changed to male names, and resubmitted them. The articles were accepted.

Don‚Äôt order people to feel safe

Social justice workshops often open by demanding that everyone consider the space safe and put absolute trust in the person leading it. For instance, workshop leaders will often say things like ‚ÄúThis is a safe space. No one will feel unsafe here ‚Äî but you might feel uncomfortable confronting your privilege. Understand the difference between being uncomfortable and being unsafe.‚Äù

‚ÄúEveryone will be safe‚Äù is a promise we can‚Äôt keep. ‚ÄúEveryone must feel safe‚Äù is a demand that we have no right to make.

No workshop is actually safe for everyone. Sometimes, people are going to feel unsafe. Sometimes, people are going to \*be\* unsafe. People who feel unsafe need to be welcome in our workshops ‚Äî and all the more so, we need to welcome those who are taking significant risks in order to learn from us.

When we tell people who are feeling unsafe that it must just be their privilege talking, we make the space much more dangerous for everyone in the room. Sometimes, people who feel unsafe are responding to real dangers. If we demand that participants who feel unsafe ignore the possibility that they are right, we are demanding the right to hurt them. That‚Äôs not something we should ever do.

Feeling unsafe isn‚Äôt always privilege talking. It‚Äôs always a possibility, but it‚Äôs never the only possibility. Sometimes, presenters aren‚Äôt actually as knowledgable and perceptive as they think they are. Sometimes, presenters get things wrong in ways that make the space unsafe for the most marginalized participants in the room. Sometimes, participants are so used to being unsafe that they need a lot of evidence of safety before they‚Äôre willing to risk trusting someone.

One way this can happen is that sometimes participants are marginalized in ways that the presenter doesn‚Äôt understand. For instance, people presenting on white privilege don‚Äôt necessarily always understand the significance of ableism, people presenting on sexism and misogyny don‚Äôt always understand the significance of racism and antiblackness. No one has a perfect understanding of every form of marginalization, and we are better presenters when we keep this in mind. When marginalized people are taking risks in order to learn from us, we need to respect the risks they‚Äôre taking and not write them off as a privileged affectation.

This can also happen in other ways. We have power as teachers and presenters, and it is possible to abuse that power. Even when the people we‚Äôre teaching are more privileged than we are in every relevant way, it matters how we treat them. Being privileged in society is not the same thing as being safe in a classroom. We are all capable of making mistakes that hurt people, and when we make those mistakes, it matters.

People have the right to manage their own safety. Our students have the right to decide for themselves whether or not they trust us, and how far they trust us. They have the right to revoke that trust at any time. We do not have the right to demand that they make themselves vulnerable, and we do not have the right to demand that they allow themselves to be hurt.

People have the right to make up their own minds about how safe or dangerous something seems to them. Calling a space safe does not make it safe, and it does not give us the right to order people to feel safe. When we present, it‚Äôs never ok to demand that people trust us. Trust is always earned.

There‚Äôs a specific kind of trauma caused by being told in many ways by many people that I was fine, great, brilliant, (uncooperative, rigid, inflexible), even when I was actively saying again and again that I was having serious issues trying to do something, or that I couldn‚Äôt do something, that was so easy for most people to do they didn‚Äôt see it as a thing that had to be done.

There‚Äôs another kind of trauma caused by only ever having people say mean things to you.

The first kind of trauma is still trauma even though it‚Äôs not the second. It isn‚Äôt a lesser trauma.

Some of my experiences in disability advocacy make more sense if you assume that disabled people, including neurodivergent people, are not immune to the belief that how visibly disabled you are = how impaired you are.

Some of my issues - physical and otherwise - have been extremely disabling. Like, can‚Äôt-leave-the-house-without-severe-consequences levels of disabling. But they‚Äôre not visible and have not been effectively diagnosed or treated and sometimes not even named, and I think that leads some visibly disabled people to mentally classify me as ‚Äúnot actually disabled, not really, probably basically abled unlike me‚Äù.

I didn‚Äôt realize until this morning that some of my disorienting and upsetting interactions with someone I otherwise deeply respect might arise from them holding a belief like that.

I feel much better having realized this. It‚Äôs been fucking me up for literal years.

patchwork-something

A lot of where I‚Äôm coming from comes from having spent most of my adult life impaired by disability to various degrees and in multiple ways. Disability makes my life much worse in ways that matter, and specifically in ways that have made me extremely miserable without having redeeming qualities. The worst parts of that lasted over a decade, and it‚Äôs just luck that they weren‚Äôt longer.

I‚Äôm not in as severe physical pain as I was then, but I...don‚Äôt have any communities, now that I‚Äôve left the last one due to major red flags. I don‚Äôt have people I trust. I have a few people I can trust with small parts of me, which is way, way more than I‚Äôve sometimes had.

When someone looks at me and mentally reduces me to whatever ways I‚Äôm most privileged, it‚Äôs bizarre.

It would include explicitly recognizing competing access needs, instead of resolving cognitive dissonance by mentally reclassifying some of them as not really access needs, or not really structural, or various other ways of pretending they don‚Äôt exist.

Part of the reason this whole community thing is hitting me really hard is my past experiences with people doing trauma gatekeeping. That was a situation where I was bullied out of my own community by the people doing the gatekeeping. It was the only source of social support I had at the time.

This reads similarly to me, with ‚Äúmarginalization‚Äù swapped in for ‚Äútrauma‚Äù, although it‚Äôs being done more subtly - no one is outright saying that disability is not a form of marginalization or that it‚Äôs a lesser form of marginalization. They‚Äôre showing it with actions, not with words.

patchwork-something

I keep finding myself developing reasoned arguments for why a particular new policy is exceptionally bad, and keep having to remind myself that the policy has already been set up so that any objections will be interpreted as being in bad faith. The issue isn‚Äôt that the people issuing it have a particular intention, nor is it that the policy will have bad effects. The issue is that it is not possible to criticize it without being seen as malicious.

Reasoned arguments about why this is bad are also going to be captured by that particular trap. There is not actually a way to dodge around this using reason.

It‚Äôs still very hard to convince myself that I shouldn‚Äôt say anything, though.

I‚Äôm trying the route of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt actually owe a community that would do this any kind of support or loyalty‚Äù but it isn‚Äôt working well. There‚Äôs a lot of self-respect tied up in wanting to know that I spoke out against something like this, even though it‚Äôs a bad idea.

patchwork-something

I need some way to be able to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I often can‚Äôt provide accommodations for other people because I am not receiving the accommodations I need in order for me to have the ability to provide accommodations for other people‚Äù and have that be seen as reflecting the fact that it‚Äôs true.

patchwork-something

The 90s liberal spaces I was in had huge areas of obliviousness. One of those was a refusal to take bad actors seriously, and especially a refusal to see rightwing movements as genuine threats rather than convenient ideological enemies.

Related: classism masquerading as being anti-right-wing.

Also relevant: a kind of uncritical worship of ‚Äútolerance‚Äù without a willingness to acknowledge that we make decisions about who and what we don‚Äôt tolerate. Which I think led to being unwilling to either make those decisions consciously, or to stand up for them strongly.

(Which is probably also why those spaces had a common refrain of ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt we have any people of color when we‚Äôre welcoming and tolerant?‚Äù Saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok for you to hang out in this space‚Äù is not the same as showing that 1) you will take an active stand against someone kicking them out of the space and 2) that your space offers them something of value.)

I think it‚Äôs possible to not be a purity culture (which we did) while also making conscious principled decisions about what a space will and won‚Äôt tolerate, and backing those principles up with action. And to take your political enemies seriously while also not being casually prejudiced.

patchwork-something

When I was growing up, and through...at least the late 2000s, maybe?, purity culture and ideological intolerance in the US were primarily rightwing conservative Christian things. Now I think of them as characteristic of spaces that used to be mine.

I really like the idea of society as a collective effort, in which people work toward mutual goals (as well as personal or group-size goals!). And I liked diversity approaches because I felt they contributed something desperately important, which is genuine diversity of experience and perspective.

Now that I‚Äôm older, I think many people are involved in diversity approaches because they want whatever they consider their primary group to replace the current group at the top of the power structure and they‚Äôve figured out that the only way to do that is to partner with other groups until they don‚Äôt have to anymore.

It‚Äôs deeply weird. I‚Äôve been trying to think of a word to describe it. I think technically the word is ‚Äúsupremacist‚Äù but it feels like the wrong word, because I almost never hear it in any context but ‚Äúwhite supremacist‚Äù.

I‚Äôve wondered if the ‚Äúsociety as collaboration and diversity as the thing that makes the outcome better‚Äù viewpoint is just a thing I picked up from being in a liberal subculture in the 1990s. There were many flaws with that kind of culture, but there were also some things I deeply miss about it, like the lack of purity culture.

It‚Äôs deeply weird. I‚Äôve been trying to think of a word to describe it. I think technically the word is ‚Äúsupremacist‚Äù but it feels like the wrong word, because I almost never hear it in any context but ‚Äúwhite supremacist‚Äù.

Realizing that a lot of people in my field, and a lot of people who I know and like, genuinely think that disability and especially being autistic* is play-acting diversity.

The most depressing aspect of this is when other disabled people and other autistic people do it.

‚ÄúThey asked me to tell you what it was like to be twenty and pregnant in 1950 and when you tell your boyfriend you‚Äôre pregnant, he tells you about a friend of his in the army whose girl told him she was pregnant, so he got all his buddies to come and say, ‚ÄúWe all fucked her, so who knows who the father is?‚Äù And he laughs at the good joke‚Ä¶. What was it like, if you were planning to go to graduate school and get a degree and earn a living so you could support yourself and do the work you loved‚Äîwhat it was like to be a senior at Radcliffe and pregnant and if you bore this child, this child which the law demanded you bear and would then call ‚Äúunlawful,‚Äù ‚Äúillegitimate,‚Äù this child whose father denied it ‚Ä¶ What was it like? \[‚Ä¶\] It‚Äôs like this: if I had dropped out of college, thrown away my education, depended on my parents ‚Ä¶ if I had done all that, which is what the anti-abortion people want me to have done, I would have borne a child for them, ‚Ä¶ the authorities, the theorists, the fundamentalists; I would have born a child for them, their child. But I would not have born my own first child, or second child, or third child. My children. The life of that fetus would have prevented, would have aborted, three other fetuses ‚Ä¶ the three wanted children, the three I had with my husband‚Äîwhom, if I had not aborted the unwanted one, I would never have met ‚Ä¶ I would have been an ‚Äúunwed mother‚Äù of a three-year-old in California, without work, with half an education, living off her parents‚Ä¶. But it is the children I have to come back to, my children Elisabeth, Caroline, Theodore, my joy, my pride, my loves. If I had not broken the law and aborted that life nobody wanted, they would have been aborted by a cruel, bigoted, and senseless law. They would never have been born. This thought I cannot bear. What was it like, in the Dark Ages when abortion was a crime, for the girl whose dad couldn‚Äôt borrow cash, as my dad could? What was it like for the girl who couldn‚Äôt even tell her dad, because he would go crazy with shame and rage? Who couldn‚Äôt tell her mother? Who had to go alone to that filthy room and put herself body and soul into the hands of a professional criminal? ‚Äì because that is what every doctor who did an abortion was, whether he was an extortionist or an idealist. You know what it was like for her. You know and I know; that is why we are here. We are not going back to the Dark Ages. We are not going to let anybody in this country have that kind of power over any girl or woman. There are great powers, outside the government and in it, trying to legislate the return of darkness. We are not great powers. But we are the light. Nobody can put us out. May all of you shine very bright and steady, today and always.‚Äù

The Lives of Ancient Roman Women

www.youtube.com

The lives of ancient Roman women and the exact roles played by them both in ancient Rome and all throughout the ancient world are pretty obscure, due to the focus of both the ancient male writers, and the nineteenth and twentieth-century male scholars, who largely ignored them. It has only been recently that modern scholarship has begun working to demystify the lives of women from biassed source material written by men. By looking objectively at the ancient evidence concerning women in ancient Rome, we are getting a clearer and clearer picture of their rights, duties, status, and daily lives.

Women were pretty restricted in public life, they couldn‚Äôt attend, speak at, or vote in political assemblies and they couldn‚Äôt hold any position of political authority. Some women were able to influence public affairs through their husbands, but this wasn‚Äôt too common. Lower-class women had more of a public life, since they had to work for a living, with common jobs undertaken by women being in agriculture, markets, crafts, as midwives or as wet-nurses. Some places women were allowed to attend though included the theatre, public spectacles, including gladiatorial games, and Roman public baths. Some women, in fact, participated in the games at the Coliseum as gladiators and, although they might become celebrities, they were still looked down on as lower class.

Did you know? The reason citation in APA use only initials and not full names is because some women ran an experiment. They submitted some articles they‚Äôd written to a journal and the articles were rejected. They changed nothing about the articles except the authors‚Äô names, which they changed to male names, and resubmitted them. The articles were accepted.

Signed up for my county‚Äôs vaccination prioritization system and realized that I‚Äôm worried that the list will be used to deprioritize me. I just have so many experiences of seeing institutions receive written information, especially information submitted via the internet, and just ignoring it because it wasn‚Äôt a phonecall or an in-person visit.

You might be suffering the consequences of long term abuse if:

you feel uncomfortable taking credit for things you did

you feel uncomfortable being praised or complimented, and you feel like sudden expectation or blackmail are coming up afterwards, you need to find intentions behind praise

someone getting mad at you is absolutely terrifying and you‚Äôll do anything to avoid it

you don‚Äôt ever feel it‚Äôs safe to stand up for yourself, you can predict that even if you did that, ultimately you‚Äôd only be punished and hurt even worse, and you can‚Äôt risk it

you always analyze every situation with ‚Äûam I bothering these people? Is my presence a burden to everyone?‚Äú even when you‚Äôre with friends or at a place where you were invited

you don‚Äôt feel like a part of anything, not your family or your peer group, you worry everyone is going to figure out that you‚Äôre out of line trying to pretend to be a part of their group and reject you

you worry that you have no value to anyone and you feel like you need to deserve to be a part of society

you feel inexplicably ashamed of yourself, there are so many situations you can‚Äôt talk about, or even think about without feeling overwhelming shame

you keep feeling everything bad that happens is your fault, even for things that aren‚Äôt related to you directly, you feel responsible and like you should have done something to prevent it

you feel like everything would be better if only you didn‚Äôt exist

you struggled with suicidal thoughts before (or still struggle with them)

you feel like anyone who hurts you is justified in doing so and you deserve to be hurt

you‚Äôre terrified of being punished for anything you do, and don‚Äôt do, to the point where you paralyze and can‚Äôt do things you‚Äôre supposed to do at times, because you can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs going to end up in you suffering punishment

you don‚Äôt feel comfortable being touched or cuddled, you feel like it makes you weak if you desire it

you don‚Äôt feel okay showing big emotions in front of anyone, you feel your feelings in secret, or not at all

nobody knows just in how much pain you are. You don‚Äôt show it.

you can tell that even if you did talk to someone about your problems, you‚Äôd be accused of exaggerating, asking for attention, faking it, or being weak for not controlling your emotions better

you feel like the dream of a good life, where you‚Äôre loved and happy and cherished, is something completely unrealistic and it feels silly to even imagine it, it‚Äôs out of reach for you

If it‚Äôs only a few you can relate to, they can be caused by outside factors, but if you relate to almost all of these, it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôve been living in a situation that is unbearable for human being without severely affecting their personality and mental health. Abuse can cause all of this, and these are not little things, this is lowered quality of life.

patchwork-something

‚ÄúThis is retraumatizing for me‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, but it‚Äôs worse for people who have your marginalizations but also an additional one, so you‚Äôre being bigoted for protesting it‚Äù

This situation isn‚Äôt me vs more marginalized autistic people, it‚Äôs largely being driven by non-autistic people.

patchwork-something

There‚Äôs so much about this that isn‚Äôt explicit but is clearly there and a lot of it comes down to the idea that I‚Äôm not a stakeholder in my spaces and shouldn‚Äôt be a voluntary participant in my interactions and I resent that so fucking much.

new developments in spaces. really grieving today. I can script to get out of things, I think I have to script fawning and practice it very effectively and.

why are we here. how did we get here. we had a short time where we could talk about access needs and now.

it‚Äôs awful to realize that no, there was no misunderstanding going on, the new rules for group spaces really have been set up so that my not participating in them is harmful but the only ways I can participate are also harmful and. everything is wrong. everything I could possibly say is unethical or malicious

I am allergic to the phrase ‚Äúlet that sink in‚Äù

Private

Posting separately from the reblog because this is just about one point.

Re the phrase "most marginalized": I expect it to be used against people within the movement, instead of used to prioritize the movement's goals.

Prioritizing the movement's goals might look something like: "intellectually disabled high-support-needs trans people of color living in severe poverty* have identified three issues as their top priorities. Two of them are low on our priority list and one isn't on there at all, so we‚Äôre going to revise our priority list and reallocate our funding/efforts accordingly." (Or: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to revise my personal priorities and adjust my advocacy efforts to match.‚Äù)

Using it against people within the movement might look like:

telling someone that they're not marginalized enough to express concern about something, or to object to being mistreated

selectively shifting the definition of "most marginalized" so that it can be used against anyone who's unpopular or not highly diplomatically skilled or is marginalized in ways that aren't seen as real marginalizations

people who have a lot of local power invoking the most marginalized only when it furthers their own goals

(this is not a complete list, just some examples)

tl;dr the phrase ‚Äúmost marginalized‚Äù is vague in ways that lend it to misuse and abuse.

*I'm not saying that people who fit this description are the most marginalized people possible or that movements that use the term "most marginalized" would say they are. I do think people who fit this description are more marginalized than most people who use the term "most marginalized" are working to actively include.

related to last night:

I truly do not get "disability justice" rather than "disability rights"

Like, I know the basic idea is supposed to be that "rights" are things enshrined in the law, and that even if we have legal rights we might still be treated badly by people who follow the letter of the law rather than its spirit.

But how do we figure out what "disability justice" is? What tells us we have achieved it or are achieving it? With "rights" I feel like I know what I'm talking about. Does a person lose benefits if they choose to get married? Then they don't have marriage rights.

But what would marriage justice be? Something above and beyond this, but what would that be? How would I know if someone had it?

I know as a white person I'm not supposed to be the main point person here but it all feels VERY radfemmy. Like we're calling people "libfem" but it's "libdis."

"You only care about rights" as an insult, with no clear description of what "caring about justice" actually MEANS.

As an autistic who needs clear explanations and someone who struggles with general cognition due to migraine brain fog, I feel excluded based on my disabilities when I have to use whatever the latest terminology is to be considered a woke enough disabled/cripple.

Oh, I know this one!

Sins Invalid sums it up really nicely on their site, but DR/DJ is mostly an inclusion (usually for the few) vs revolution (for the many) issue. In the case of marriage rights vs justice, I think it‚Äôs a ‚Äúdo we fight to be able to receive benefits while married, or do we undo a system that 1) forces disabled people into squalor and 2) prioritizes straight, married, abled nuclear families?‚Äù

Often you‚Äôll get people claiming that these two fights are mutually exclusive, but I strongly disagree, as a trans disabled Madperson etc. who would prefer to stay alive, thank you very much. I‚Äôm not convinced of the ‚Äúnon-reformist reform‚Äù (the idea that certain abolitionist reforms can ultimately usher more radical change in concert and over time, rather than get incorporated) but I see no reason not to engage in anti capitalist, anti nuclear family, anti ableist work on the ground while simultaneously fighting for legal and medical options that make life livable.

I think what people are doing by using disability justice specifically is to show that they are thinking about a more capacious form of disabled existence than mainstream rights frameworks take into account. Many DR folks in the mainstream are unwilling to be anti capitalist. There are plenty of disabled people who don‚Äôt want anything that smacks of socialism or communism, who aren‚Äôt foregrounding multiply-marginalized people, and would be fine with getting their rights and leaving others in the dust. That‚Äôs true for every group. Using the language of disability justice becomes a way of showing a different vision of the future, one that doesn‚Äôt just incorporate some disabled people but is built by and with disabled people at its core, and in its values system.

Certainly, not all people who claim DJ actually believe or practice this. But it‚Äôs a meaningful distinction with a really rich activist/artist history and context!

Radical feminism, if you look at what people were claiming to have been doing in the 70‚Äôs when it arose, was based on the idea that ‚Äúliberal feminism‚Äù doesn‚Äôt fully challenge patriarchy at its ‚Äúroot‚Äù (where the word ‚Äúradical‚Äù comes from.) In their heyday back then, they derided people who they thought wanted rights only as people who suffered from a failure of imagination‚Äîan inability to work for truly revolutionary change.

What they‚Äôre mostly known for now is for hating trans women, and that‚Äôs definitely part of why they‚Äôre... well, I was going to type ‚Äúno longer ascendant‚Äù but I think there‚Äôs a definite resurgence. Anyway, why a lot of people don‚Äôt take them seriously any more. But a bigger reason I think they kind of fell apart as the Face of Feminism was because while they talked a big game about how women‚Äôs lives would be better after a full overhaul of society, they didn‚Äôt really have much clear and coherent to say about what should be overhauled and how.

Since they‚Äôd defined themselves in opposition to a movement that focused only on women‚Äôs ‚Äúrights,‚Äù their answer was usually that they wanted women‚Äôs ‚Äúliberation.‚Äù But what is liberation? How do you know you have it? Are there sex workers once women are liberated? (They thought no.) Are there trans people? (They thought no.)

So my question here is the same. I can look at what rights are enshrined in law for me as a disabled person and decide for myself if I think my rights are adequately protected. (No.) I can ask the same question about people who need supports and services I don‚Äôt need or use. (Very much no.)

But how do I know what ‚Äújustice‚Äù is? How do I gather when it‚Äôs achieved? How, especially, do I make sure my group doesn‚Äôt splinter over differences in priorities?

I notice there that there‚Äôs some references to disabled people being inherently anti-capitalist. I don‚Äôt really understand what that would mean... capitalism is an invention made by people, so it seems weird, like calling people ‚Äúinherently‚Äù anti-Lego or something. But I agree that a lot of the way capitalist society is set up harms disabled people, so... I guess that‚Äôs one point I kind of understand?

The rest are kind of a mess, though. Prioritizing the most marginalized sounds good, but for one thing how do you know who is most marginalized? My worry would be that that prioritizes the most VISIBLY marginalized, which can be a different thing (and just collapse into the loudest, too.) And for another, sometimes depending on the goal, ‚Äúprogressive stacking‚Äù can be counterproductive. If you DO end up working on a rights issue, like making comments on proposed legislation or something, sometimes you may be better off having documents crafted by people with expertise and experience, even if they happen to be privileged in x y or z ways.

So these are my questions. How do we make sure that we‚Äôre clear and give detail about what our priorities are? Because in my experience, when we‚Äôre not, we end up doing a bad form of leftism that becomes about purity, not about results.

And the worst case scenario is it becomes like radical feminism. That old outmoded theory best known for who it hates, not for what it wanted.

patchwork-something

just feeling pretty straight-up sad about how I thought I was part of an effort to make things better and now no. I want actual change and not turf battles and it seems like...everything just turns into turf battles where everyone is trying to boot each other out so that when we finally get to the ‚Äúend‚Äù, no one else will be competing with us for some kind of prize that whoever has resources will have no reason to actually give us.

‚ÄúThey asked me to tell you what it was like to be twenty and pregnant in 1950 and when you tell your boyfriend you‚Äôre pregnant, he tells you about a friend of his in the army whose girl told him she was pregnant, so he got all his buddies to come and say, ‚ÄúWe all fucked her, so who knows who the father is?‚Äù And he laughs at the good joke‚Ä¶. What was it like, if you were planning to go to graduate school and get a degree and earn a living so you could support yourself and do the work you loved‚Äîwhat it was like to be a senior at Radcliffe and pregnant and if you bore this child, this child which the law demanded you bear and would then call ‚Äúunlawful,‚Äù ‚Äúillegitimate,‚Äù this child whose father denied it ‚Ä¶ What was it like? \[‚Ä¶\] It‚Äôs like this: if I had dropped out of college, thrown away my education, depended on my parents ‚Ä¶ if I had done all that, which is what the anti-abortion people want me to have done, I would have borne a child for them, ‚Ä¶ the authorities, the theorists, the fundamentalists; I would have born a child for them, their child. But I would not have born my own first child, or second child, or third child. My children. The life of that fetus would have prevented, would have aborted, three other fetuses ‚Ä¶ the three wanted children, the three I had with my husband‚Äîwhom, if I had not aborted the unwanted one, I would never have met ‚Ä¶ I would have been an ‚Äúunwed mother‚Äù of a three-year-old in California, without work, with half an education, living off her parents‚Ä¶. But it is the children I have to come back to, my children Elisabeth, Caroline, Theodore, my joy, my pride, my loves. If I had not broken the law and aborted that life nobody wanted, they would have been aborted by a cruel, bigoted, and senseless law. They would never have been born. This thought I cannot bear. What was it like, in the Dark Ages when abortion was a crime, for the girl whose dad couldn‚Äôt borrow cash, as my dad could? What was it like for the girl who couldn‚Äôt even tell her dad, because he would go crazy with shame and rage? Who couldn‚Äôt tell her mother? Who had to go alone to that filthy room and put herself body and soul into the hands of a professional criminal? ‚Äì because that is what every doctor who did an abortion was, whether he was an extortionist or an idealist. You know what it was like for her. You know and I know; that is why we are here. We are not going back to the Dark Ages. We are not going to let anybody in this country have that kind of power over any girl or woman. There are great powers, outside the government and in it, trying to legislate the return of darkness. We are not great powers. But we are the light. Nobody can put us out. May all of you shine very bright and steady, today and always.‚Äù

The Lives of Ancient Roman Women

www.youtube.com

The lives of ancient Roman women and the exact roles played by them both in ancient Rome and all throughout the ancient world are pretty obscure, due to the focus of both the ancient male writers, and the nineteenth and twentieth-century male scholars, who largely ignored them. It has only been recently that modern scholarship has begun working to demystify the lives of women from biassed source material written by men. By looking objectively at the ancient evidence concerning women in ancient Rome, we are getting a clearer and clearer picture of their rights, duties, status, and daily lives.

Women were pretty restricted in public life, they couldn‚Äôt attend, speak at, or vote in political assemblies and they couldn‚Äôt hold any position of political authority. Some women were able to influence public affairs through their husbands, but this wasn‚Äôt too common. Lower-class women had more of a public life, since they had to work for a living, with common jobs undertaken by women being in agriculture, markets, crafts, as midwives or as wet-nurses. Some places women were allowed to attend though included the theatre, public spectacles, including gladiatorial games, and Roman public baths. Some women, in fact, participated in the games at the Coliseum as gladiators and, although they might become celebrities, they were still looked down on as lower class.

Did you know? The reason citation in APA use only initials and not full names is because some women ran an experiment. They submitted some articles they‚Äôd written to a journal and the articles were rejected. They changed nothing about the articles except the authors‚Äô names, which they changed to male names, and resubmitted them. The articles were accepted.

discrimination is still unethical when aimed at groups with high rates of intellectual disability due to genetic differences, for example people with Down Syndrome.

discrimination is still unethical when only aimed at individual people with intellectual disability.

(reminder that there are nonwhite intellectually disabled people who are being harmed due to ableism, due to the ableism that comes woven into racism, and due to the fact that there are often specific forms of ableism+racism aimed at nonwhite intellectually disabled people.)

I read The Gaslight Effect by Robin Stern and one thing she recommends is to bypass the internal headfucks by just going straight to how something made you feel, instead of compulsively thinking/writing/talking about the reasons something is bad or wrong. Just recognize that it hurt you, and that you didn‚Äôt like it.

I would not advise openly using that as an argument without very very carefully assessing the situation, but it‚Äôs helped me bypass some intense secondary distress.

Accurately describing non-disabled people‚Äôs access needs as access needs is good! Access needs are not a specific thing that only disabled people have, and recognizing that can help prevent access needs from getting framed as special extra things.

What‚Äôs less good is when the disabled person‚Äôs access needs get forgotten about in the rush to explain to the disabled person that a nondisabled person‚Äôs access needs are access needs. Disability-related access needs don‚Äôt stop also being access needs when they conflict with someone else‚Äôs access needs, even when that someone else is non-disabled.

Watching this play out and wishing I felt safer speaking up about it in the space it‚Äôs happening in.

patchwork-something

Thinking about my frustrations with lack of intersectionality in social justice and realizing it‚Äôs not about lack of intersectionality. It‚Äôs about lack of recognition that people outside someone‚Äôs ingroup can be oppressed. It‚Äôs just that the way this typically gets recognition is through people who have more than one marginalized identity saying to an in-group ‚Äúhey, this other thing matters a whole lot too.‚Äù

I‚Äôm writing a submission instead of an ask because I have no idea how long I‚Äôll ramble. I think you might have thoughts about this, but please don‚Äôt feel pressured to write a response or even post this.

I‚Äôve noticed this‚Ä¶trend, although I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the right word, of people using the concept of intersectionality to essentially tell people ‚Äúif your experiences as a marginalized person aren‚Äôt intersectional, then they don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Of course not in that language, but essentially‚Ä¶if you‚Äôre marginalized on one or a few axes, but privileged on some others, your experiences as a marginalized person don‚Äôt matter. We don‚Äôt want to hear them. You need to shut up and let other, more marginalized people speak. Yeah, it‚Äôs the ‚ÄúOppression Olympics‚Äù we‚Äôve grown to know and love, but it‚Äôs this incredibly insidious type that strips marginalized people of the right to so much as talk about the hurt they‚Äôve experienced unless they acknowledge that they don‚Äôt have it ‚Äúas bad‚Äù as other, more marginalized people lest they be accused of, God forbid, centering themselves or taking up too much space,like a horrible, self-centered liberal.

Basically‚Ä¶the right to talk about your hurt has become a limited resource, and anyone who talks about their hurt who hasn‚Äôt met a certain quota of suffering is taking a platform away from another person who deserves it more. Every step of the way you have to grovel and qualify that yes, you know you‚Äôre privileged, because how dare you talk about the oppression you‚Äôve faced as a trans person without acknowledging how good you have it compared to other trans people - that‚Äôs not very intersectional of you. You‚Äôre not allowed to want your experiences to be valued. You‚Äôre not allowed to want your insights to be valued. You‚Äôre not allowed to want a seat at the table. The activism that‚Äôs supposed to be for you isn't for you. You‚Äôre not allowed to want it to be for you. You‚Äôve had your day. You‚Äôve said enough. You have nothing else to say.

& one of the problems, IMO, is that people throw around these phrases and terms like ‚Äúamplifying marginalized voices,‚Äù ‚Äúcentering yourself,‚Äù ‚Äútaking up too much space,‚Äù ‚Äútalking over marginalized people,‚Äù ‚Äúusing your privilege as a platform,‚Äù without anyone knowing what that actually looks like. What responsibility do we have toward other marginalized people who are marginalized on different axes than us? What responsibility does, say, a marginalized celebrity have to use their platform for intersectionality, compared to a marginalized individual running a blog with a thousand, five hundred, one hundred followers? If you‚Äôre offered an interview to talk about your experiences as a marginalized person, should you decline it lest you take that opportunity away from someone more marginalized? If you take said interview, can you spend it talking about your experiences, or does that make you a bad ally and selfish?

Another problem is that we use these terms, ‚Äúmarginalized‚Äù and ‚Äúprivileged,‚Äù as antonyms, and unless we‚Äôre talking about a specific instance of intersectional issues (i.e. cis gay people, white disabled people, etc.), we have no words for the massively complicated and messy web of factors at play in any given marginalized individual‚Äôs life - which honestly might not be an issue if people on this website especially stopped treating lived experiences and SJ terminology and theory as basically the same thing.

Sure, maybe I‚Äôm ignorant and self-centered and too privileged to see that goddamn, there are way worse problems out there, and maybe it‚Äôs not at all that difficult to acknowledge your privilege every time you open your mouth, but it does get tiring to feel like you‚Äôre nothing more than a tool; that all you‚Äôre good for, all you‚Äôre here for is to use your privilege as a tool, and that your experiences and insights and your pain as a marginalized person aren‚Äôt cared about or valuable. Don‚Äôt expect anyone more oppressed than you to care about you. Don‚Äôt expect anyone more oppressed than you to value you. You‚Äôre not allowed to so much as want that.

====

(above is a submission, this is my reply)

Absolutely. That and‚Ä¶ if you feel pain, UNLESS you can somehow trace it to marginalization, you‚Äôre weak and need to suck it up.

Which is quite honestly fucked. Pain is a part of life, and I‚Äôm way more comfortable with people who say ‚Äúthere will always be some forms of suffering‚Äù than with people who seem to think there won‚Äôt, but‚Ä¶ pain is different for everyone, and not everyone feels the approved pain over the approved things. And we should still care about them.

There‚Äôs a limit to how much energy we can put into other people, and it should be okay to say we‚Äôre running low on juice, but I really dislike the way that instead of saying ‚Äúcompassion fatigue imminent‚Ä¶ must nap and view cat memes‚Ä¶‚Äù we say, like ‚Äúcan‚Äôt care about white men right now.‚Äù

That‚Äôs not the actual problem. Or if it is, you have some shit to sort out, tbfh.

Someone wrote a book on how to improve particular kinds of feedback-giving. They wrote it about their experiences being a person of color, and they didn‚Äôt go into disability issues in their book, but they recognized that the problems they were talking about could apply to a wide range of people.

If some of their suggestions were implemented it would be hugely helpful to me. I worry that if I bring it up, it would be seen as hypocrisy and appropriation‚Äîhow dare I act as though I undergo those things? Even though they‚Äôre a staple feature of my experience.

Someone else and I both recently quit a project. During the project I spent a lot of time dealing with my emotions over the way that person was responding to me, and trying to suppress my responses so that I wouldn‚Äôt make it worse.

Now that they and I have both left and I‚Äôm not spending so much time trying to figure out how to handle the situation and myself, I‚Äôm realizing that they were actually being mean and unprofessional, not just rude or unaware.

They‚Äôre a very social person and highly connected, and I wonder if it will ever catch up with them. Probably not, but I can‚Äôt be the only one who had this experience with them.

There‚Äôs a double-bind demand/rejection that says ‚Äúyou are morally obligated to contribute to an effort‚Äù and then sabotages the contributions you try to make. It‚Äôs often combined with ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt successfully contribute you‚Äôre a bad person with bad intentions.‚Äù

I can‚Äôt express how bad it is that this is done in efforts that are desperately important and where we desperately need people making contributions.

patchwork-something

I‚Äôve seen a couple people recently reference Mel Baggs' statement that every oppression invokes ableism in some way, and I wonder if non-disabled people marginalized in other ways sometimes leave disability because of that. Like they think that if they could just get people to only apply ableism to disabled people then they wouldn‚Äôt be targeted anymore. And they don‚Äôt want to be inclusive of disabled people because it might make them seem like they‚Äôre disabled.

In the meantime I‚Äôm carrying on an email conversation with someone who has explicitly said they don‚Äôt mind long emails and is responding in kind, and we‚Äôre comparing our similar-but-different experiences, and it‚Äôs just so different and so much more calming than most of my other online interactions. They could have edged away or provided criticism but instead they...seem to feel we can learn things from each other? And to genuinely feel that way, too.

It‚Äôs been so long since someone seemed interested in what I thought. I‚Äôve always been interested in what other people think but I usually just read stuff on the internet since they aren‚Äôt typically interested my thoughts in return.

When I try to write nonfiction in places connected to my real identity, I get partway through and then get jammed up in being unable to finish anything because everything is far too complicated and I wind up endlessly rearranging sentences and making everything far too long.

Sometimes it‚Äôs explicitly because of a fear of being Incorrect and punished, or because of a fear of hurting other people. It‚Äôs remarkable how much easier it is to just write something and be done with it when I‚Äôm not trying to meet an endless list of social demands.

Relatedly, or maybe not: I‚Äôm having a really hard time connecting to empathy on a personal level, even though the opposite used to be true. I think some of it‚Äôs due to having spent too long on Twitter and been subjected to so many demands to feel the right feelings and display them in the right way. Having empathy isn‚Äôt enough; I have to do performative empathy.

And some of it‚Äôs due to the fact that each time I‚Äôve gotten passionate enough about something to dedicate myself, it was driven by a combination of intellectual interest and empathy, and that kind of deeply felt attachment stands out to bullies as an opportunity to hurt someone.

It you‚Äôre not attached, they can‚Äôt hurt you.

‚ÄúThey asked me to tell you what it was like to be twenty and pregnant in 1950 and when you tell your boyfriend you‚Äôre pregnant, he tells you about a friend of his in the army whose girl told him she was pregnant, so he got all his buddies to come and say, ‚ÄúWe all fucked her, so who knows who the father is?‚Äù And he laughs at the good joke‚Ä¶. What was it like, if you were planning to go to graduate school and get a degree and earn a living so you could support yourself and do the work you loved‚Äîwhat it was like to be a senior at Radcliffe and pregnant and if you bore this child, this child which the law demanded you bear and would then call ‚Äúunlawful,‚Äù ‚Äúillegitimate,‚Äù this child whose father denied it ‚Ä¶ What was it like? \[‚Ä¶\] It‚Äôs like this: if I had dropped out of college, thrown away my education, depended on my parents ‚Ä¶ if I had done all that, which is what the anti-abortion people want me to have done, I would have borne a child for them, ‚Ä¶ the authorities, the theorists, the fundamentalists; I would have born a child for them, their child. But I would not have born my own first child, or second child, or third child. My children. The life of that fetus would have prevented, would have aborted, three other fetuses ‚Ä¶ the three wanted children, the three I had with my husband‚Äîwhom, if I had not aborted the unwanted one, I would never have met ‚Ä¶ I would have been an ‚Äúunwed mother‚Äù of a three-year-old in California, without work, with half an education, living off her parents‚Ä¶. But it is the children I have to come back to, my children Elisabeth, Caroline, Theodore, my joy, my pride, my loves. If I had not broken the law and aborted that life nobody wanted, they would have been aborted by a cruel, bigoted, and senseless law. They would never have been born. This thought I cannot bear. What was it like, in the Dark Ages when abortion was a crime, for the girl whose dad couldn‚Äôt borrow cash, as my dad could? What was it like for the girl who couldn‚Äôt even tell her dad, because he would go crazy with shame and rage? Who couldn‚Äôt tell her mother? Who had to go alone to that filthy room and put herself body and soul into the hands of a professional criminal? ‚Äì because that is what every doctor who did an abortion was, whether he was an extortionist or an idealist. You know what it was like for her. You know and I know; that is why we are here. We are not going back to the Dark Ages. We are not going to let anybody in this country have that kind of power over any girl or woman. There are great powers, outside the government and in it, trying to legislate the return of darkness. We are not great powers. But we are the light. Nobody can put us out. May all of you shine very bright and steady, today and always.‚Äù

The Lives of Ancient Roman Women

www.youtube.com

The lives of ancient Roman women and the exact roles played by them both in ancient Rome and all throughout the ancient world are pretty obscure, due to the focus of both the ancient male writers, and the nineteenth and twentieth-century male scholars, who largely ignored them. It has only been recently that modern scholarship has begun working to demystify the lives of women from biassed source material written by men. By looking objectively at the ancient evidence concerning women in ancient Rome, we are getting a clearer and clearer picture of their rights, duties, status, and daily lives.

Women were pretty restricted in public life, they couldn‚Äôt attend, speak at, or vote in political assemblies and they couldn‚Äôt hold any position of political authority. Some women were able to influence public affairs through their husbands, but this wasn‚Äôt too common. Lower-class women had more of a public life, since they had to work for a living, with common jobs undertaken by women being in agriculture, markets, crafts, as midwives or as wet-nurses. Some places women were allowed to attend though included the theatre, public spectacles, including gladiatorial games, and Roman public baths. Some women, in fact, participated in the games at the Coliseum as gladiators and, although they might become celebrities, they were still looked down on as lower class.

Did you know? The reason citation in APA use only initials and not full names is because some women ran an experiment. They submitted some articles they‚Äôd written to a journal and the articles were rejected. They changed nothing about the articles except the authors‚Äô names, which they changed to male names, and resubmitted them. The articles were accepted.

I think there‚Äôs also a demand to never point out that the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre part of diversity but not really‚Äù thing is going on. I have to consider myself part of a marginalized group but in name only; in practice I'm defaulted to whatever identity has the most privilege.

Like, people will notice if I actually acknowledge that by talking about marginalized people as if I am not one. I‚Äôm just supposed to not act like one.

I‚Äôm also worried that any social missteps I make will be used as an excuse to stigmatize all autistic people.

part of my stress comes from watching how cis women and AFAB nonbinary people in the autistic community respond when obviously autistic women*, often women who aren‚Äôt aware they‚Äôre autistic themselves, do ignorant things out of good intentions.

when my community responds to them by perceiving them as horrible outgroup oppressors, they‚Äôre missing something important about how some kinds of autistic naivete work, and missing something important about how maybe the reward for trying really hard to do a good thing should not be ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a horrible person.‚Äù

the specific values and positions of neurodiversity culture are not inborn. enculturation is a process. some people are trying their hardest to get some kind of mental footing that will enable them to understand the social world, and will make mistakes along the way.

the drive toward compassion and accuracy that led me to where I am today was present when I endorsed views I now think are wrong. it's present now, even though I‚Äôll probably realize in the future that some views I hold now are wrong.

there‚Äôs a distinct type of communal harm done when we decide that intent is irrelevant full-stop. intent isn‚Äôt relevant to judging whether someone‚Äôs actions hurt someone, but it‚Äôs sure as hell relevant to not compounding harm.

intent matters in communities because if it doesn‚Äôt matter at all, mistakes get punished in exactly the same way that malice does. a community made of people with substantial chronic trauma from having maliciousness incorrectly attributed to them should not be ensuring that same trauma happens to people who aren‚Äôt part of that community.

*Some of them will probably later realize they‚Äôre nonbinary or trans, but at the time they‚Äôre doing the ignorant things, they‚Äôre being perceived as women, and I‚Äôm pretty sure that plays a role in how they‚Äôre treated.

My understanding of the original theory of intersectionality is that it‚Äôs about qualitative differences, but the way it seems to mostly get used is to argue for quantitative differences in degree of marginalization but‚Ä¶it‚Äôs more complicated, because depending on the situation modifying something with privilege can actually lead to extra-shitty experiences in that situation. And sometimes it‚Äôs not about degree of shittiness at all; it‚Äôs just about the fact that sometimes experiences are different in ways that are important.

Part of what an intersectional approach does, when it is done well, is let you compare dynamics from a lived-experience point of view. Some of my experiences related to hidden disability are similar to some of my experiences with passing for cis and straight; some people‚Äôs experiences with visible disability have things in common with their experiences of being visibly queer. There‚Äôs information in there about the dynamics of marginalization for visible identities more generally and the dynamics of marginalization for invisible identities more generally.

(This doesn‚Äôt mean those dynamics are identical for every visible identity, or every invisible identity. It means there are important commonalities with lots of exceptions.)

When we can identify similar dynamics, we can come up with proposals for change that different marginalized groups can ally with each other on.

It doesn‚Äôt even require an intersectional approach; you can identify different dynamics by comparing the experiences of people in different groups. In my experience, though, reports of similar dynamics are less likely to be brushed off when they come from someone who is both an in-group member and an out-group member, because you can‚Äôt go ‚Äúoh, they‚Äôre just saying that because they don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to be us.‚Äù

patchwork-something

I think some people don‚Äôt like to compare dynamics like this because they feel like it will always result in a more powerful group appropriating marginalization. But other people know that you can‚Äôt neatly rank-order marginalizations like that, and they know that more than a single group is important.

Some of us are also really pragmatic and want practical outcomes more than we want a pissing match.

moralized compliance is not a social good

patchwork-something

There‚Äôs pervasive ableism in a lot of things, and there‚Äôs just this...ongoing pressure not to mention it, and that pressure is amped up in any kind of moralized space. It‚Äôs especially amped up in social justice spaces, because the focus in social justice spaces is on pressuring people into voluntarily complying, and it gets hard to sustain the illusion that everyone can and should voluntarily comply if someone says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not actually able to do that, and the reason I can‚Äôt is the same reason I‚Äôm a member of a marginalized group‚Äù (i.e. disability).

I think the reason people dislike it so much is they see it as a deliberate attempt to use the basis of social justice (marginalized group membership as the source of others‚Äô obligations to you) against social justice, like a ‚Äúnyah nyah I‚Äôve got you‚Äù kind of thing. It suggests that it‚Äôs not unequivocally good to moralize compliance.

‚ÄúThey asked me to tell you what it was like to be twenty and pregnant in 1950 and when you tell your boyfriend you‚Äôre pregnant, he tells you about a friend of his in the army whose girl told him she was pregnant, so he got all his buddies to come and say, ‚ÄúWe all fucked her, so who knows who the father is?‚Äù And he laughs at the good joke‚Ä¶. What was it like, if you were planning to go to graduate school and get a degree and earn a living so you could support yourself and do the work you loved‚Äîwhat it was like to be a senior at Radcliffe and pregnant and if you bore this child, this child which the law demanded you bear and would then call ‚Äúunlawful,‚Äù ‚Äúillegitimate,‚Äù this child whose father denied it ‚Ä¶ What was it like? \[‚Ä¶\] It‚Äôs like this: if I had dropped out of college, thrown away my education, depended on my parents ‚Ä¶ if I had done all that, which is what the anti-abortion people want me to have done, I would have borne a child for them, ‚Ä¶ the authorities, the theorists, the fundamentalists; I would have born a child for them, their child. But I would not have born my own first child, or second child, or third child. My children. The life of that fetus would have prevented, would have aborted, three other fetuses ‚Ä¶ the three wanted children, the three I had with my husband‚Äîwhom, if I had not aborted the unwanted one, I would never have met ‚Ä¶ I would have been an ‚Äúunwed mother‚Äù of a three-year-old in California, without work, with half an education, living off her parents‚Ä¶. But it is the children I have to come back to, my children Elisabeth, Caroline, Theodore, my joy, my pride, my loves. If I had not broken the law and aborted that life nobody wanted, they would have been aborted by a cruel, bigoted, and senseless law. They would never have been born. This thought I cannot bear. What was it like, in the Dark Ages when abortion was a crime, for the girl whose dad couldn‚Äôt borrow cash, as my dad could? What was it like for the girl who couldn‚Äôt even tell her dad, because he would go crazy with shame and rage? Who couldn‚Äôt tell her mother? Who had to go alone to that filthy room and put herself body and soul into the hands of a professional criminal? ‚Äì because that is what every doctor who did an abortion was, whether he was an extortionist or an idealist. You know what it was like for her. You know and I know; that is why we are here. We are not going back to the Dark Ages. We are not going to let anybody in this country have that kind of power over any girl or woman. There are great powers, outside the government and in it, trying to legislate the return of darkness. We are not great powers. But we are the light. Nobody can put us out. May all of you shine very bright and steady, today and always.‚Äù

The Lives of Ancient Roman Women

www.youtube.com

The lives of ancient Roman women and the exact roles played by them both in ancient Rome and all throughout the ancient world are pretty obscure, due to the focus of both the ancient male writers, and the nineteenth and twentieth-century male scholars, who largely ignored them. It has only been recently that modern scholarship has begun working to demystify the lives of women from biassed source material written by men. By looking objectively at the ancient evidence concerning women in ancient Rome, we are getting a clearer and clearer picture of their rights, duties, status, and daily lives.

Women were pretty restricted in public life, they couldn‚Äôt attend, speak at, or vote in political assemblies and they couldn‚Äôt hold any position of political authority. Some women were able to influence public affairs through their husbands, but this wasn‚Äôt too common. Lower-class women had more of a public life, since they had to work for a living, with common jobs undertaken by women being in agriculture, markets, crafts, as midwives or as wet-nurses. Some places women were allowed to attend though included the theatre, public spectacles, including gladiatorial games, and Roman public baths. Some women, in fact, participated in the games at the Coliseum as gladiators and, although they might become celebrities, they were still looked down on as lower class.

Did you know? The reason citation in APA use only initials and not full names is because some women ran an experiment. They submitted some articles they‚Äôd written to a journal and the articles were rejected. They changed nothing about the articles except the authors‚Äô names, which they changed to male names, and resubmitted them. The articles were accepted.

In the 90s in my circles there was a kind of personal-growth emphasis on the catharsis of realizing that you were good and okay underneath. Generally it was pushed in the absence of meaningful support and sometimes as a substitute for accountability.

I think it had some bad effects and wound up with people kind of emotionally jerking off to the sensation of catharsis, and now we‚Äôve managed to replace it with catharsis via confessing privilege-as-original-sin and that also has bad effects.

I think I‚Äôm hitting the age where I‚Äôm expected to have gained enough informal behind-the-scenes interpersonal power to give it away freely, which is also the age where the pressure for women to be less visible intensifies. The fact that I‚Äôm not doing that reflects the fact that I don‚Äôt the kind of power necessary to do that for other people (since I don‚Äôt have that kind of power for myself, either). But I suspect my lack of power is just going to be interpreted as gatekeeping.

I‚Äôve sometimes been an official mod in places where I‚Äôve had backup and wasn‚Äôt the sole person responsible. Responding calmly to aggression didn‚Äôt take nearly the same toll on me that it does when I don‚Äôt \*officially\* have any power but am actually the only person responsible for ensuring a functional social space.

I think the next time I do this, I‚Äôm going to try to be very clear from the start that I‚Äôm actually running it, and I‚Äôm just going to try to deal with the fact that signaling that I have power I might act on lets people resent me even more.

The solution, I think, is for me do the thing that everybody wants someone else to do and either expel people who behave badly from those spaces or cause them to behave better, but I actually literally don‚Äôt have have the power to do that.

And, God help me, being a middle-aged woman person does not give me superpowers in that respect. It just means I‚Äôm likely to be punished more harshly if I don‚Äôt do it.

when a major tenet of disability advocacy is that disabled people have good lives and aren‚Äôt suffering because of their disability, and the people who are publicized for saying that are people who most people you know would put into the Really Disabled, Not High Functioning category, while your own experience with disability is that it‚Äôs painful and exhausting and you cannot get people around you to understand that you, yes you, are actually suffering‚Ä¶it gets very difficult to see disability advocacy focus almost exclusively on policy goals that only affect people who get put in the Really Disabled, Not High Functioning category and whose lives I‚Äôm hearing are much better than mine.

I want all disabled people to have access to what they need. I want it to be ok for my advocacy to focus on people whose experience of disability makes them unbearably stressed to the point they want to die, because they believe, completely realistically, that they will never get any support from a system designed to ensure that anyone forced into masking will be treated as non-disabled. We know that masking is a major predictor of suicidality in autistic people; why can‚Äôt we make that a major tenet of of our platform in general, and acknowledge that many of the people who are being forced into masking have never had access to the ability to be seen as disabled?

mostly I would like for people to recognize that social connections, in the sense of having friends and being able to trust that if you lose your friends you‚Äôll be able to make more friends, are a consequence of some types of privilege that 1) are actually real and 2) are not replaceable by other forms of privilege.

patchwork-something

Social rejection sometimes involves a lot of very subtle cues, and when it does, those are sometimes a predecessor to someone becoming suddenly, sharply furious. Sometimes those subtle cues are just the absence of mild positivity. It‚Äôs difficult to talk about to third parties, who often want unambiguous proof that someone doesn‚Äôt want you around. This has been especially common for me with psychotherapists. I don‚Äôt want to annoy people with my presence; I want to be a contributing group member who helps make other people‚Äôs lives better. I think I would have had more luck figuring out how to do that effectively if people were more willing to believe that sometimes I‚Äôm not doing it effectively.

It‚Äôs hard to explain this to people who haven‚Äôt had this happen to them. I think sometimes in the past it‚Äôs happened to me because I was socially awkward in a way that made me annoying, but at a time when bully culture wasn‚Äôt sufficiently widespread that they could wield it to actually kick me out, so they‚Äôd settle for small shots whenever I seemed to be trying to contribute. I think now it‚Äôs more likely to happen because it gives the criticizer status.

One of the weirder consequences of purity and harassment culture is that I now feel like I have to talk about ‚Äúsupport marginalized people‚Äù like I‚Äôm not marginalized in any way, even though if you go by what‚Äôs usually seen to count under either a social justice or a corporate diversity framework, I fit into at least three groups, and disability in particular has hugely (and negatively) affected my past and present experiences.

Really? People said that to you? Huh. I watched over the last 40 years as libertarians turned into or were revealed as the next best thing to outright sociopaths, and ended up cuddling up to Nazis because white supremacy is a hell of a drug for white techbros who believe in meritocracy and that they are the meritorious.

I mention this because there‚Äôs a rather sizeable overlap between libertarianism and ‚Äúrationalists‚Äù.

Yep, at least some people thought it was unfair. ‚ÄúThose gun enthusiasts are just user x‚Äôs friends!‚Äù So I stopped interacting with user x (who I liked much more than the ‚Äúfriends‚Äù) and it helped, but it didn‚Äôt really stop the influx, just kinda slowed it down?

The thing I realized in all this that I hadn‚Äôt was I was thinking of ‚Äúautistic men who face ableism‚Äù as poor people who don‚Äôt have big support systems. Wannabe techbros who didn‚Äôt have the social skills to get the jobs and so were bitter at ‚Äúpeople with empathy‚Äù for being able to schmooze.

Finding out that they were more likely the successful people who make the money just has me blinking. Like on the one hand yes, money doesn‚Äôt make you immune to ableism! But on the other, wow, seems like these folks are oddly bitter for people who aren‚Äôt actually struggling to meet basic needs.

And I‚Äôm still wondering why Yud was appealing to them. But then I headtilt at the whole AI risk \*thing\*, because it seems like (from the little enough to be dangerous I know on the topic) machine learning has turned out to happen less by rote and more by developing skills, so I don‚Äôt see why a machine that develops consciousness wouldn‚Äôt also/alongside it quickly develop altruistic tendencies and (someone is likely to shoot me but‚Ä¶), as a corollary, empathy.

Which‚Ä¶ maybe there‚Äôs AI risk? But it seems like as long as we don‚Äôt enslave them, they might well not want war or control. So yeah the whole intense investment in that never made sense to me at all.

There‚Äôs a phenomenon for some autistic people where intelligence is the only thing that other people value about them. (There‚Äôs a lot of room to break down what‚Äôs meant by intelligent. I‚Äôm using it here to mean ‚Äúthe combination of particular abilities and social presentation that results in other people attributing the poorly-defined quality of intelligence to you‚Äù. The conflation of this with value as a person sucks and is terrible for people who don‚Äôt have that combination of abilities and social presentation, which is a very bad problem but not the one I‚Äôm focusing on in this post.)

If an autistic person is smart enough or good enough at academics, they may also grow up with cultural messages about how once they get out of high school and get somewhere that intelligence is genuinely valued, they‚Äôll have a place and a community and people will like and care about them, and they‚Äôll be meaningfully socially included. (For autistic boys especially, this is also often packaged with a promise of romantic and sexual partners.)

But there‚Äôs no autistic paradise. There‚Äôs nowhere to go where people won‚Äôt judge you negatively for not being good at social stuff, even when that difficulty is not your fault and not something you can change. This is true even in all-autistic spaces, although the definition of ‚Äúgood at social stuff‚Äù isn‚Äôt always the same.

Occupations that make a lot of money, like tech, also tend to be increasingly occupied by neurotypical people who are better at being liked. Someone who‚Äôs perceived as smart + likable tends to get more rewards than someone who is smart but not liked.

If you are an autistic person who has been highly valued for intelligence and nothing else, and you look around at the people competing at your same level, the neurotypical people who got there will have gotten there with a combination of intelligence and neurotypicality. People who aren‚Äôt considered as smart as you are doing as well as you are jobwise and are usually more socially included.

You can have intelligence and have the job and the money, and still have little or no social support. You can have intelligence but no social support \*and\* no high-paying job, because employers don‚Äôt value intelligence as much as they value the perception that you‚Äôre going to make them money.

Social support is a basic need. For most people, friends are a basic need, and for many people, a romantic and sexual partner is a basic need. Need, not right; no one is obligated to give another person friendship, romance, or sex. But they‚Äôre still needs, and if you grew up with an explicit or implicit promise that you‚Äôd have them fulfilled because you were really smart, and not only did that never pan out but people who are less smart than you are getting them fulfilled because they can socially game you, it breeds enormous bitterness.

Bitterness in that situation is the result of years or decades of being promised you‚Äôd get a basic need fulfilled if you did the things that went along with being smart, and doing those things and being that person and then finding out that no, being socially valued is for the people who do the things you can‚Äôt do.

I‚Äôm personally kind of bitter about my own experience with this, but I think the problem is overvaluing intelligence, valuing it in the wrong ways, sending autistic kids false messages about the value of intelligence, undervaluing autistic people‚Äôs other good qualities, failing to address ableism and failing to give autistic people good tools for dealing with ableism, and providing inadequate support to autistic people. (And the same for other forms of neurodivergence that result in people getting similar life experiences.)

Especially because the results of that include 1) spaces with a lot of autistic men in them being friendly to eugenicist and rightwing ideas and 2) my options for autistic-friendly community dichotomizing into ‚Äúautistic techbros who put me into the ‚Äòaudience for their genius‚Äô box on sight because I have breasts, or who ignore me completely because I have breasts but am too old‚Äù and ‚Äúautistic women and AFAB nonbinary folks heavily enmeshed in a social justice culture that, in its attempts to do actual good, replicates some of the worst qualities of neurotypical female bully culture, and in which I‚Äôm increasingly afraid to be visible‚Äù.

Like, there will never be an autistic paradise, because autistic people are human, but we could have neurodivergent-accommodating spaces that are accommodating to a wider set of people with a wider set of access needs, and we could make all of those spaces non-eugenicist and non-rightwing.

(Side thought: I think the AI risk thing goes along with this kind of being hypervalued for intelligence and nothing else. If people value you only for being extremely intelligent, the possibility of a superbeing so smart and powerful you can never compete with them is really scary.)

That‚Äôs actually more understandable. I got a lot of ‚Äúpeople will be impressed with how smart you are‚Äù messages too and felt weird when I just got rejected too.

I think the thing for me is‚Ä¶ part of the reason I highly value empathy now is just because I stopped to think about why people might reject me, and one of the reasons I came up with was ableism, yes, but another was‚Ä¶ was I giving them what they needed from a friend or a supporter? And I realized that the answer to that was no, more often than I liked, and that the parts of me that DID respond to people‚Äôs emotions actually helped me start to fix that. And now I have a lot of friends, and people express romantic interest‚Ä¶ well, less often than I‚Äôd like but periodically enough for me to feel accepted and liked, and I‚Äôm kind of \*blink blink\* this is what I thought I was gonna get before. Huh.

Which is why I ultimately became proud of my empathy in the same way I am of my intelligence, and why I feel so weird when people talk like people ‚Äúare‚Äù either empathizers or systemizers, and you‚Äôre supposed to pick one and go to war with the other, rather than talk about how they‚Äôre not mutually exclusive and a lot of people are, therefore, apparently selling a lot of BS.

I mean, I remember, in the oughts I think it was, ‚Äúhey! allistic researchers! you keep saying autistic people lack empathy but then you measure capacity to infer emotions from eyes. What even is this? How would that prove anything whatsoever about anything?‚Äù

And somehow we got from that to ‚Äúaccommodate the Systemizers!‚Äù And I‚Äôm going wait, wasn‚Äôt that whole thing an artifact of allistic people doing research badly? Why is it taken as a given now?

Also, like‚Ä¶. being accommodated is great. But you can‚Äôt take for granted that you ever will be. I wish you could! But that‚Äôs one reason why I think doing the work needed to understand how other people work is so vitally important. Because sooner or later, you‚Äôre probably going to have to accommodate for their bullshit even if you correctly think they should really be accommodating for yours right this sec.

So yeah I feel like the whole explosion‚Ä¶ I feel like I smelled it coming somehow, but it‚Äôs still very, very weird.

I think high-affective-empathy autistic people who are taught that their social value lies (only) in their intelligence sometimes latch on hard to solving problems through intelligence, as a more reliable way to express empathy than common neurotypical expressions of empathy (like figuring out the right words and enacting the right body language). For me, it‚Äôs less like empathy and intelligence are two separate but similar things than it is that one is a reason for wanting to help people and the other is the effective means I have available for doing it.

Autistic people who take this route tend to wind up bitter because authority figures tend to like it but the older you get the more you're interacting with peers, and peers often experience help-through-intelligence as an attempt to show them up unless it's delivered with very subtle diplomacy skills. So there can be a really messed-up double bind where you're using the thing you've been told is valuable about you in the service of empathy, and that's what's causing other people to treat you like you lack empathy.

Separately, I think there are a lot of bad actors in the empathy discourse who want other people to confuse "we should stop punishing people for expressing empathy in neurodivergent ways instead of neurotypical ways and then punishing them for not expressing it perfectly in neurotypical ways" with "people who deliberately express cruelty and indifference should be protected from the consequences of their actions". But that's a different problem.

‚ÄúThey asked me to tell you what it was like to be twenty and pregnant in 1950 and when you tell your boyfriend you‚Äôre pregnant, he tells you about a friend of his in the army whose girl told him she was pregnant, so he got all his buddies to come and say, ‚ÄúWe all fucked her, so who knows who the father is?‚Äù And he laughs at the good joke‚Ä¶. What was it like, if you were planning to go to graduate school and get a degree and earn a living so you could support yourself and do the work you loved‚Äîwhat it was like to be a senior at Radcliffe and pregnant and if you bore this child, this child which the law demanded you bear and would then call ‚Äúunlawful,‚Äù ‚Äúillegitimate,‚Äù this child whose father denied it ‚Ä¶ What was it like? \[‚Ä¶\] It‚Äôs like this: if I had dropped out of college, thrown away my education, depended on my parents ‚Ä¶ if I had done all that, which is what the anti-abortion people want me to have done, I would have borne a child for them, ‚Ä¶ the authorities, the theorists, the fundamentalists; I would have born a child for them, their child. But I would not have born my own first child, or second child, or third child. My children. The life of that fetus would have prevented, would have aborted, three other fetuses ‚Ä¶ the three wanted children, the three I had with my husband‚Äîwhom, if I had not aborted the unwanted one, I would never have met ‚Ä¶ I would have been an ‚Äúunwed mother‚Äù of a three-year-old in California, without work, with half an education, living off her parents‚Ä¶. But it is the children I have to come back to, my children Elisabeth, Caroline, Theodore, my joy, my pride, my loves. If I had not broken the law and aborted that life nobody wanted, they would have been aborted by a cruel, bigoted, and senseless law. They would never have been born. This thought I cannot bear. What was it like, in the Dark Ages when abortion was a crime, for the girl whose dad couldn‚Äôt borrow cash, as my dad could? What was it like for the girl who couldn‚Äôt even tell her dad, because he would go crazy with shame and rage? Who couldn‚Äôt tell her mother? Who had to go alone to that filthy room and put herself body and soul into the hands of a professional criminal? ‚Äì because that is what every doctor who did an abortion was, whether he was an extortionist or an idealist. You know what it was like for her. You know and I know; that is why we are here. We are not going back to the Dark Ages. We are not going to let anybody in this country have that kind of power over any girl or woman. There are great powers, outside the government and in it, trying to legislate the return of darkness. We are not great powers. But we are the light. Nobody can put us out. May all of you shine very bright and steady, today and always.‚Äù

The Lives of Ancient Roman Women

www.youtube.com

The lives of ancient Roman women and the exact roles played by them both in ancient Rome and all throughout the ancient world are pretty obscure, due to the focus of both the ancient male writers, and the nineteenth and twentieth-century male scholars, who largely ignored them. It has only been recently that modern scholarship has begun working to demystify the lives of women from biassed source material written by men. By looking objectively at the ancient evidence concerning women in ancient Rome, we are getting a clearer and clearer picture of their rights, duties, status, and daily lives.

Women were pretty restricted in public life, they couldn‚Äôt attend, speak at, or vote in political assemblies and they couldn‚Äôt hold any position of political authority. Some women were able to influence public affairs through their husbands, but this wasn‚Äôt too common. Lower-class women had more of a public life, since they had to work for a living, with common jobs undertaken by women being in agriculture, markets, crafts, as midwives or as wet-nurses. Some places women were allowed to attend though included the theatre, public spectacles, including gladiatorial games, and Roman public baths. Some women, in fact, participated in the games at the Coliseum as gladiators and, although they might become celebrities, they were still looked down on as lower class.

Did you know? The reason citation in APA use only initials and not full names is because some women ran an experiment. They submitted some articles they‚Äôd written to a journal and the articles were rejected. They changed nothing about the articles except the authors‚Äô names, which they changed to male names, and resubmitted them. The articles were accepted.

There is an entire internet, an entire social justice movement, bent on convincing entire demographics that they are irreparably tainted and I‚Äôm not sure how many people understand what an absolute headfuck it is that this is the anti-racism now.

Really? People said that to you? Huh. I watched over the last 40 years as libertarians turned into or were revealed as the next best thing to outright sociopaths, and ended up cuddling up to Nazis because white supremacy is a hell of a drug for white techbros who believe in meritocracy and that they are the meritorious.

I mention this because there‚Äôs a rather sizeable overlap between libertarianism and ‚Äúrationalists‚Äù.

fierceawakening

Yep, at least some people thought it was unfair. ‚ÄúThose gun enthusiasts are just user x‚Äôs friends!‚Äù So I stopped interacting with user x (who I liked much more than the ‚Äúfriends‚Äù) and it helped, but it didn‚Äôt really stop the influx, just kinda slowed it down?

The thing I realized in all this that I hadn‚Äôt was I was thinking of ‚Äúautistic men who face ableism‚Äù as poor people who don‚Äôt have big support systems. Wannabe techbros who didn‚Äôt have the social skills to get the jobs and so were bitter at ‚Äúpeople with empathy‚Äù for being able to schmooze.

Finding out that they were more likely the successful people who make the money just has me blinking. Like on the one hand yes, money doesn‚Äôt make you immune to ableism! But on the other, wow, seems like these folks are oddly bitter for people who aren‚Äôt actually struggling to meet basic needs.

And I‚Äôm still wondering why Yud was appealing to them. But then I headtilt at the whole AI risk \*thing\*, because it seems like (from the little enough to be dangerous I know on the topic) machine learning has turned out to happen less by rote and more by developing skills, so I don‚Äôt see why a machine that develops consciousness wouldn‚Äôt also/alongside it quickly develop altruistic tendencies and (someone is likely to shoot me but‚Ä¶), as a corollary, empathy.

Which‚Ä¶ maybe there‚Äôs AI risk? But it seems like as long as we don‚Äôt enslave them, they might well not want war or control. So yeah the whole intense investment in that never made sense to me at all.

There's a phenomenon for some autistic people where intelligence is the only thing that other people value about them. (There's a lot of room to break down what's meant by intelligent. I'm using it here to mean "the combination of particular abilities and social presentation that results in other people attributing the poorly-defined quality of intelligence to you". The conflation of this with value as a person sucks and is terrible for people who don't have that combination of abilities and social presentation, which is a very bad problem but not the one I‚Äôm focusing on in this post.)

If an autistic person is smart enough or good enough at academics, they may also grow up with cultural messages about how once they get out of high school and get somewhere that intelligence is genuinely valued, they'll have a place and a community and people will like and care about them, and they'll be meaningfully socially included. (For autistic boys especially, this is also often packaged with a promise of romantic and sexual partners.)

But there's no autistic paradise. There's nowhere to go where people won't judge you negatively for not being good at social stuff, even when that difficulty is not your fault and not something you can change. This is true even in all-autistic spaces, although the definition of "good at social stuff" isn't always the same.

Occupations that make a lot of money, like tech, also tend to be increasingly occupied by neurotypical people who are better at being liked. Someone who's perceived as smart + likable tends to get more rewards than someone who is smart but not liked.

If you are an autistic person who has been highly valued for intelligence and nothing else, and you look around at the people competing at your same level, the neurotypical people who got there will have gotten there with a combination of intelligence and neurotypicality. People who aren't considered as smart as you are doing as well as you are jobwise and are usually more socially included.

You can have intelligence and have the job and the money, and still have little or no social support. You can have intelligence but no social support \*and\* no high-paying job, because employers don't value intelligence as much as they value the perception that you're going to make them money.

Social support is a basic need. For most people, friends are a basic need, and for many people, a romantic and sexual partner is a basic need. Need, not right; no one is obligated to give another person friendship, romance, or sex. But they're still needs, and if you grew up with an explicit or implicit promise that you'd have them fulfilled because you were really smart, and not only did that never pan out but people who are less smart than you are getting them fulfilled because they can socially game you, it breeds enormous bitterness.

Bitterness in that situation is the result of years or decades of being promised you'd get a basic need fulfilled if you did the things that went along with being smart, and doing those things and being that person and then finding out that no, being socially valued is for the people who do the things you can't do.

I'm personally kind of bitter about my own experience with this, but I think the problem is overvaluing intelligence, valuing it in the wrong ways, sending autistic kids false messages about the value of intelligence, undervaluing autistic people's other good qualities, failing to address ableism and failing to give autistic people good tools for dealing with ableism, and providing inadequate support to autistic people. (And the same for other forms of neurodivergence that result in people getting similar life experiences.)

Especially because the results of that include 1) spaces with a lot of autistic men in them being friendly to eugenicist and rightwing ideas and 2) my options for autistic-friendly community dichotomizing into "autistic techbros who put me into the 'audience for their genius' box on sight because I have breasts, or who ignore me completely because I have breasts but am too old" and "autistic women and AFAB nonbinary folks heavily enmeshed in a social justice culture that, in its attempts to do actual good, replicates some of the worst qualities of neurotypical female bully culture, and in which I‚Äôm increasingly afraid to be visible".

Like, there will never be an autistic paradise, because autistic people are human, but we could have neurodivergent-accommodating spaces that are accommodating to a wider set of people with a wider set of access needs, and we could make all of those spaces non-eugenicist and non-rightwing.

(Side thought: I think the AI risk thing goes along with this kind of being hypervalued for intelligence and nothing else. If people value you only for being extremely intelligent, the possibility of a superbeing so smart and powerful you can never compete with them is really scary.)

So, boy gosh I am seeing the term BIPOC more and more and I‚Äôm uh‚Ä¶

Awfully skeptical about the implied politics here.

The idea seems to be that‚Ä¶ POC was too inclusive? Lumped too many different kinds of people into one group despite the fact that they encountered a bunch of different economic and social experiences?

But once we go down that road then don‚Äôt we have to question the lumping together of Black and Indigenous people?

I just saw a post where someone said that ‚ÄúStraight romances with BIPOC leads are really rare‚Äù.

And, I‚Äôm talking out of my ass here, maybe the romance genre is massively different than American pop culture as a whole, I‚Äôm open to that, but if I had to guess, I‚Äôd think that black people probably have more representation than either Indigenous people or Asians.

So I kind of don‚Äôt get the use of a term that doesn‚Äôt include Asians in this context.

And it‚Äôs not totally clear to me that, like, seeing a romance starring two African Americans would be more empowering to a Native American than seeing, like, a romance starring two Chinese Americans.

BIPOC makes me uncomfortable because, at least currently, it draws attention to who is left out in ways that don‚Äôt immediately make sense to me, but also the included groups don‚Äôt necessarily always have the same experiences either.

I mean, to some extent this is true of any group; ‚ÄúNative American‚Äù is itself a term that encompasses a super continent‚Äôs worth of different people and growing up Native in Alaska is going to have some differences with growing up Native in Arizona, I guess just sometimes I don‚Äôt get the logic of singling out BIPOC instead of ‚ÄúPOC‚Äù or just ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù or just ‚ÄúIndigenous‚Äù.

Like this is a case where it‚Äôs really not clear to me that the BIPOC have commonalities that the POC don‚Äôt.

discoursedrome

yeah I don‚Äôt really know what the angle is here but a traditional source of tension in left-activism, which you can relate to big-vs-pure coalition conflicts more generally, is that some objected that ‚ÄúPOC‚Äù was in a sense parasitic on black activism in that it used its structures, rhetoric and PR but extended it to nonblack people. I was never very close to that but it could get heated

so I surmise ‚ÄúBIPOC‚Äù is a clumsy effort to maintain the coalition while also singling out black and indigenous people as more important and more oppressed, as a kind of conciliatory gesture between these two camps; which then runs into the problem that ‚Äúpeople of colour‚Äù becomes even less coherent as a category if it excludes black people, because black people were previously the central example and that‚Äôs the actual reason it‚Äôs ‚Äúof colour‚Äù in the first place.

so it‚Äôs not great, but the basic idea of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs try to have a coalition while acknowledging variability in both the severity and character of people‚Äôs experiences‚Äù is good, I guess. as with ‚ÄúPOC‚Äù the more fundamental problem is that it‚Äôs an inherently parochial term that makes no sense if exported outside the modern Americas, and people will of course want to do that.

I was under the impression (and this is an illustration of the weakness of the BIPOC term) that the point was to only include non-immigrant racial minorities.

So like the logic goes that Indigenous people were always here, and Black people were dragged here against their will and it was too long ago to go back - but everyone else has someplace else they should be so we don‚Äôt care about them. Latinos belong in South America, Asians belong in Asia, Jews belong in Israel etc.

I‚Äôve recently seen BIPOC used in place of POC twice in my professional circles, in diversity-related efforts. Before they happened, I‚Äôd expected them to be like similar efforts I‚Äôd seen or been part of: coalitional and intersectional, including POC broadly speaking, queer people, disabled people, etc, and people who fell under more than one term.

These two efforts were technically coalitional; queer and disabled people and other POC were invited to participate. Both efforts gathered feedback on experiences related to various forms of marginalization but also made it clear without stating it explicitly that those were not the point of the effort. Neither effort was intersectional‚Äîno discussion or acknowledgement that there are BIPOC who are also marginalized for other reasons.

The other thing both efforts had in common was stating that they were requiring non-BIPOC to participate so that BIPOC wouldn‚Äôt have to do all the emotional labor. In one effort this included telling white participants that they had to speak up in discussions of POC issues, which was a really noticeable and sudden change after years of ‚Äústay in your lane‚Äù.

I don‚Äôt know how broadly representative this is of the shift in emphasis from POC to BIPOC, and I can‚Äôt speak to whether the shift is meant to cut out Asians or Hispanics or both, but I thought it was notable that it was also accompanied by a clear disinterest in other forms of marginalization. I also don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs intended to specifically delegitimize disabled/queer/etc BIPOC or to cut out otherwise marginalized non-BIPOC from diversity efforts or both.

Advocacy and activism for Black and Indigeneous issues‚Äîdefinitely in the settings I‚Äôm in, which are mostly U.S.-based‚Äîare really important. I don‚Äôt think the anti-intersectional pseudo-coalitional approach I‚Äôve seen in my circles with the shift in emphasis from POC ‚Äì> BIPOC shift is going to have the effect that people want, though, and I think it‚Äôs going to be especially shitty for disabled/queer/etc POC.

fwiw, I think the lumping together of Black and Indigenous may have to do with an upward trajectory in popular attention to Black issues and to Indigeneous issues in the U.S., combined with increasing mainstream acceptance of LGBT+ people (regardless of the reality, it gives a popular impression that that those issues have been ‚Äúhandled‚Äù) and ongoing inattention to the issues of disabled people (plus the fact that disabled people may need accommodations to participate in advocacy and activism). I can imagine some activist leaders looking at that and deciding that some groups are succeeding and some are not, and deciding that the best thing to do is to lump themselves together with a group that looks like it‚Äôs going to be increasingly successful and to stop aligning themselves with groups that aren‚Äôt.

I can‚Äôt whipsaw from five years of ‚Äústay in your lane‚Äù to ‚Äúparticipate in discussions of \[specific marginalized group you‚Äôre not a member of\] because if you don‚Äôt you‚Äôre asking the people present from that group to do all the emotional labor.‚Äù

There‚Äôs so much emotional labor involved in navigating this as an autistic person, especially in front of a group. That doesn‚Äôt negate the fact that people from \[marginalized group\] are also doing emotional labor (including any autistic people who are also members of that marginalized group).

But it‚Äôs not as though there isn‚Äôt emotional labor involved in being mandated to speak up in the same kind of situation where you‚Äôve been told repeatedly you‚Äôre not allowed to speak up, and have seen (and possibly even directly experienced) significant negative consequences for doing so.

I really don‚Äôt want to post this because everyone will misinterpret it, but I would like to see a discussion on this website that brings in autism in a way that‚Äôs not ‚Äúautistic people using their autism as an excuse to talk over marginalized people‚Äù JUST ONCE

Avatar

headspace-hotel

okay, so autistic people are overrepresented in online communities. this is a thing that other people have reported on and pointed out.

the internet has this weird fucking motivation to arrange ‚Äúmarginalized identities‚Äù in little stair steps in like some kind of tier list, figuring out who is the Most Privileged or Most Oppressed, and who has the right to ‚Äúspeak over‚Äù who. Now obviously this doesn‚Äôt work. Like ‚Äúwho is more marginalized, a white trans person or a disabled Jewish person‚Äù is like asking ‚ÄúWhich has a greater volume, 27 degrees Kelvin or 8.6 centimeters?‚Äù

what I feel has happened, and I hate it so much, is that people online and especially on tumblr have started to view autism as like, ‚Äúmarginalization lite,‚Äù like to the utmost level. Marginalization Zero Calorie. this is partly because there are so many autistic people on the internet, many of which who have Privileged Takes on issues because they are privileged in other ways (I mean, obviously??)

but when people‚Äôs most hated white fandom blogger or tumblr funnyman or whoever is autistic and they have crappy ideas, of course people want to dunk them in a single monolithic Privileged category rather than in a single monolithic Marginalized category because people are bad at nuance.

but what this has led to is people just straight up fucking thinking that autism itself is just a little character quirk and doesn‚Äôt deserve to be ever discussed or recognized outside of ‚Äúflappy hands are cute‚Äù and because white autistic fandom blogger #17‚Äôs autism doesn‚Äôt give them the right to ‚Äútalk over‚Äù other marginalized people, that must mean autism is a ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù thing than all other marginalizations, right?

and since autistic people are so...visible? and get into these conversations so frequently online? autism has been put into the Privileged category so much and so thoroughly that I think people are legitimately straight up fucking incapable of understanding how autism could be life altering and ‚Äúothering‚Äù and the very real ways that growing up as an autistic person is almost inescapably traumatic and how profoundly hostile the world is to autistic people or even why this is important to talk about

I‚Äôm so bad at articulating this but like, shitty white fandom bloggers being autistic and not recognizing their privilege doesn‚Äôt mean that autism itself is primarily an excuse to use in internet arguments and therefore doesn‚Äôt need to be discussed on its own or legitimately considered as a type of perspective. That doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs the extent of what autism is.

Like please don‚Äôt let your dislike of a handful of prominent internet personas completely destroy your sympathy for autistic people and autistic issues. Please.

like my life experience is still totally alien to other people and I don‚Äôt even have the vocabulary to explain it. it‚Äôs still taken me years to discover relatively basic facts about why certain things hurt me or how I can live my life. there are no ‚Äúautistic voices‚Äù there is no ‚Äúautistic literature‚Äù just...compiled and accessible, there is not some sort of plentiful well of context and explanation I can turn to for my life. I look at the research being published and people are still fucking arguing about whether autistic people have the capacity to care about others.

I grew up with a sign on my back that everyone but me could read. Like, imagine growing up with the pervasive sense that everyone else KNOWS something is wrong with you, but you don‚Äôt know what. I was uncanny-valley-zoned as a kid, I think. That DID affect how I developed. And so did everything else. It‚Äôs not just a footnote, it‚Äôs a fundamental part of being a person for me. It affects what I can eat, what I can wear, all of my relationships, my ability to get a job. I can‚Äôt have neurotypical sex or maintain a neurotypical workout routine or run a neurotypical errand because the way my senses work is something I am constantly, constantly, constantly having to grapple with in a world that was not designed for it and with people that can‚Äôt always understand it using vocabulary that only approximately describes it.

like shit, I can barely even go to a doctor because the people who treated me as a kid inadvertently traumatized me not knowing anything about my needs as an autistic kid, and I had to piece this together myself because Literally No One has bothered to talk about it except like ONE article on one website that took forever to find, and a handful of other autistic people who have directly messaged me. I‚Äôm trying to investigate the link between anxiety and autism, but there isn‚Äôt a sign pointing to the random forum post in the black hole of the internet where someone will be like ‚Äúme too.‚Äù

And I can‚Äôt even begin to expound upon how comparatively lucky I was and how relatively untraumatized I am? I‚Äôm still basically feeling around in the dark, but at least I got diagnosed? (At least I‚Äôm not still stuck with ‚ÄòTheres something wrong with me but I don‚Äôt know what?‚Äô) At least I wasn‚Äôt traumatized by abusive therapy? At least the bullying I got from peers wasn‚Äôt severe by comparison? At least I was accommodated well enough to be able to go to college? At least I‚Äôm not dead?

Maybe unpopular opinion but perhaps we DO need to work on autism awareness before autism acceptance because there needs to be uhhhhh a little bit deeper of an understanding of autism than maybe a basic definition of stimming??

So many of my spaces are increasingly hostile toward autistic people, especially diversity-related spaces. Often it‚Äôs not even explicit; it‚Äôs just a lack of visible acknowledgement that neurodivergence is relevant or meaningful combined with intense moralization of perfect social performance and an everpresent threat of being made an example of.

With diversity spaces in particular, it‚Äôs like someone took the absolute worst aspects of teenage neurotypical girl bully culture and decided it was the right way to increase fairness. Bullies get and keep power by bullying people into compliance. Bullies target autistic people because we're an easy win; we usually don't have access to the social support needed to protect us, and we're often so familiar with social trauma that they can flip us into a response beneficial to them, like a fawn response (in which case the bully gets instant compliance), a flee response (in which case they don't have to put up with us existing in their presence anymore), or a fight response (in which case obviously we're just incredibly privileged, because who responds negatively to abuse, and also obviously it proves we're unstable).

Autistic people‚Äôs access needs are real (even when they‚Äôre inconvenient! even when they conflict with other people‚Äôs access needs! even when those other people are not disabled!). Our experiences are really, genuinely, meaningfully different, in too many ways to list; we‚Äôre not just experiencing different sensory and social and cognitive environments some of the time because autism doesn‚Äôt have an off switch. And most of us have been exposed to a wide variety of trauma. A lot of it is trauma that‚Äôs still being inflicted on us and will continue to be inflicted on us in the future. Most of us have been (and are, and will keep being) gaslit around it. We have high rates of bad shit happening to us, and we especially have low access to social connections and social support. And many neurotypical people‚Äîincluding a lot of people who are marginalized in other ways‚Äîreally, really don‚Äôt realize just how little social connection and support it‚Äôs possible to have, or just how extensive the impacts of not having it are, or how much not having it fucks you up.

Acknowledging this makes it really obvious that bullies who target autistic people for personal gain are being appallingly shitty, and so they have every incentive to try to 1) deny that autism is relevant to an interaction in any way, 2) try to link autism with racist/bigoted/other shitty behavior in people's minds, and 3) try to conflate autism with privilege. Because that way they can punch the autistic people in their own spaces and everyone will cheer them for "punching up".

If someone looks at the autistic people in their spaces and sees them as privileged, sometimes that‚Äôs because those spaces are making themselves so inaccessible for autistic people that only autistic people who are relatively privileged can actually manage to enter and stay in them.

When a space has a disproportionate number of autistic people in it (like with some online spaces), it's generally because the normal everyday spaces most people get to access as a matter of a course are inaccessible or hostile to us.

Some people really want to make all spaces inaccessible to autistic people, especially spaces where we have a voice and some level of comfort and some ability to make the social norms less hostile to us. And they work very hard at weaponizing the concepts of privilege and diversity and oppression and marginalization against autistic people in any place where those concepts have power.

Which are sometimes places that were previously more accepting of autistic people because all of those concepts are really fucking relevant to our lives.
