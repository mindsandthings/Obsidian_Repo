I am the kind of person who:

• Values herself

• Values others

• Orients toward helping as part of center self

• Orients toward evolving and growing as part of center self

• Values ethics and never loses them

• Has sympathy and empathy

• Pursues solutions

• Has an internal compass

• Can see and recognize the thread to follow, can find meaning in the world

• Can make meaning

• Has the power to change

• Can know that this is true and others' perceptions cannot take it away

• Is a promise

This is inherently true.

• No one can take it away from me - it is my right as a human being.

• When people think otherwise, they are wrong.

• I can believe that they are wrong.

• I can go beyond my role - my personal qualities are not limited in the ways that are put on me.

• These things can be true of me, and I can believe them to be true of me even if others disbelieve.

• I have the power to define and assess myself.

• I have the power to believe in myself and ignore other people.

• Social expectations cannot take that away from me.

• I can enter any conversation with knowledge of what I am.

• What I deserve is not defined by what I can get. I have the right to keep looking - and I have the right to accept a situation for now. I can watch and wait.

• I have the right to accept flexibly - I have the right to choose my level of acceptance, my level of performance and expression of potential, in line with my mental health.

I value:

• Worth and dignity

• Empathy and compassion

• Helping people

• Respecting people as not ignorant

• Respecting people as different from me

• Acknowledging that other people have priorities and values that are important to them

• Clear communication

I am.

• I am a promise.

• I am an actuality.

• I am what I have built.

• I am what I can do.

• I am a million spinoffs as I move through life.

• I am a built human.
