Terrapass says my emissions are 8298 lbs for $41.41 and that the average American is 63934 lbs. 
So about 200 lbs per dollar. That would make the average American about $320/year. 

That would be $13,210 for 41 years of my life if I assume I am average. 

If I assume an average lifespan of 81 for American women, that's $25,920. 

I am probably underestimating somehow.
