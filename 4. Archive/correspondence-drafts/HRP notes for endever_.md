# HRP notes for endever*
hello! I think we have finished reviewing and commenting on y'all's HRP. we have a couple more things to ask you about it but there is no rush on our end - we'll mention them here but can also bring them up again whenever you let us know you want to work on it.


those things are: 1) a reminder that you were going to note down some system-relevant stuff for Katurah and me


2) I don't know if Katurah is NT but I know that NTs and some non-NTs are more comfortable working with other people if they have met them face-to-face (like over Zoom) and I wanted to offer to do that if you and she would find it valuable.


2:11 PM

3) at some point I think it would be good to do a walkthrough of the plan, where Katurah and you and I go through all the steps as if we were actually doing it (including set up stuff on webpage etc), to identify potential issues.



their reply: 

yay tysm!! we are kind of on hold working on it until we pull all the way out of this episode, so we indeed might ask you to remind us of those three things later. but at first glance, yes, maybe, and yes :))
