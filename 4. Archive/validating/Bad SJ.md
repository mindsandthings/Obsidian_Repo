My hypothesis is that in like 10 years gen z is gonna have a big cult boom the way the boomers did in the 70s 

It’s already happening on tik tok. There’s a fun new thing going round that’s citing common symptoms of depression and anxiety as signs you’re about to have your awakening and that you are actually an alien and the reason you don’t feel right is because you’re home sick for your own galaxy. So that’s fun.

agreed, and i don’t mean this in a “haha gen z is so dumb they’re gonna join a tiktok cult lmao” i mean that conditions are *perfect* for the formation of cults right now.
	* high unemployment and a lot of underpaying, pointless jobs = people are looking for things to do with their life, a *purpose*
	* skyrocketing cost of living = most young people will not be able to live on their own, meaning some will end up in a group living situation with people interested in recruiting them
	* it’s a time of great cultural and political upheaval, nothing feels real, people are desperate for meaning and human connection. cults promise that
	* there is a new wave of acceptance and understanding for ways of life outside the norm, which is great! …except for when cult leaders tell you abusive and controlling practices are just their culture, their religion, their lifestyle, their beliefs, their tradition, and if you disrespect it you are the problem
	* social media influencers have already shown us how easy it is to build a cult of personality and attract people from anywhere in the world who are interested in the exact brand you are selling
	* spirtuality is having a boom, as are things like astrology, crystals, tarot, meditation, energy… those things aren’t bad on their own but they are often used as tools of cult spaces
	* wellness. i think a lot of people are already in wellness cults. you can make people do a lot of things in the name of “wellness” and a big factor of maintaining a cult is keeping members in a state of decreased cognition….. like say, with regular fasting
	* i think people are just unaware in general of how cults function, especially because the satanic panic was a big stupid false alarm that convinced the youths that dungeons and dragons or doom were gateways to cults, which are scary evil child murdering, satan-worshipping gangs. people don’t know how to spot them in real life.
* 
So if that’s the case everyone remember with me the cardinal rules of not getting cult’d
# SOCIAL BUFFER: Learn what healthy social boundaries are and develop relationships which are within those boundaries.
Be wary of those who step on your or others’ boundaries. Be there for your friends, but don’t be their therapists or parents. Go get coffee or juice or snacks & chat casually with a friendly crew on a regular basis.
# ESTEEM BUFFER. Recognize that you and every other person on this planet are owed a baseline of respect.
Respect means that what you wear, what/who you take interest in, and who/what you are are things which you decide on based on your own reasoning. If anyone is trying to change your mind, make sure to think critically about their side and decide for yourself whether you want to change. Ask: *Why do they want you to change? Is that valid to your situation? Who / what would benefit from this change? Do you want them / it to benefit? Then***decide for yourself***.*
# RELAXATION BUFFER. Take
# time
# exclusively for yourself.
Take care of your body and mind when it needs to be fed, watered, washed, or nurtured. Have a couple hobbies that are **just for you.**Have more than one interest. Think about more than just one topic. Cults keep you focused on them to the exclusion of all else, so don’t allow yourself to be blocked in.
# BUBBLE POP BUFFER: Learn from multiple sources, even ones you don’t like or respect.
Read multiple sources’ versions of events before you decide what you feel about something. Recognize that not all sources are valid, but understand what those invalid sources are trying to do. Are they misguided or malicious? Who are THEIR sources? What is the agenda? Who benefits? Why would they want to say what they’re saying? Do they have a point? Who pays them? What do they care about? Then make your decision.
**BEWARE THE B.I.T.E.:**Cults control people via Behavior, Information, Thought, and Emotion control. BITE
Look up the BITE model and consider it against groups you wish to join / have joined.
# Remember. You are the arbiter of your mind.

You have the blessing and burden of making your own decisions. Other people who will love and care about you throughout your life will want you to think for yourself and will think for themselves. 
# You are not alone. You are worthwhile. Your thoughts are your own and you have every right to control them yourself.

People are totally getting cult’d. That’s what Stop the Steal and QAnon were.

The problem happens when we go “that can’t happen to us.”

**Okay, so I have more to say here, and the more I have to say is likely at least a little controversial, so. PLEASE DO NOT ASCRIBE IT TO OP OR TO ANYONE ELSE IN THE THREAD, IT’S MINE.**
I’ve thought a lot about this, and the more I think about it, the more I feel that the way the left gets cult’d is through encouraging lack of empathy.
Now people use that word in a LOT of ways, so please read what I have to say before you assume I said “People with certain personality traits are valorized on the left” or something, because while I actually might think that too, it’s not what I mean here.
What I mean is that the culty stuff on the left **dismisses people’s feelings**, and not only that it **TRAINS PEOPLE to see ignoring people’s feelings as a form of growing strength** when **it’s actually the beginning of transforming into a bully.**
Think about how people respond when someone in an online convo is confused by a statement like “men are trash” (or the predecessor “I drink male tears” which seems to have poofed though I don’t know why.) When the person says something like “that hurts my feelings” or even “I don’t understand,” there’s a flood of sarcasm about how privileged people’s feelings have been coddled for generations, and marginalized people don’t have to do that any more.
…Did you catch that? I just showed you the recruitment tactic, though it went by kinda fast.
**The way the culty versions of the left recruit people is by telling us that we don’t have to be nice.**
This is actually REALLY appealing. Most people, definitely including most marginalized people, have days where we just DON’T WANT TO BE NICE about something that really irked us, godDAMN IT ALL.
**Culty versions of SJ use that.** They tell us “It’s okay to be angry.” They tell us we can, and should, let it out. That it’s not wrong to do so.
And this, so far as it goes, is neither bad nor wrong. Just like a lot of other insidious recruitment tactics aren’t bad or wrong. Let’s take TERFs. (Please. To an island. A secluded one.)
Often what they start with isn’t obviously bad and *might even be true.*“I worry about the imagery in porn” or “Some kinky guys are just pushy assholes with an aesthetic blog” or “Hey, society really loudly tells young women we’re supposed to find dicks sexy. What if some of us, you know,*just don’t*?”
But **there’s a very specific place you’re supposed to go from there.**Porn and sex work are bad and workers have no agency, BDSM is inherently misogynistic even though the trappings of the culture come from gay men, and trans women are evil predators who are trying to gaslight you by using the word lesbian.
All of which are a LOT more debatable… to put it mildly.
**Bad SJ is the same.**It starts off by telling us (to pick groups I’m not in to start with and then expand out) that we don’t have to pander to “cis feelings” or “het feelings” or “nondisabled feelings” (or “white feelings” or “bougie feelings” or “thin feelings” or “Christian feelings” or…)
Again, did you catch that? It doesn’t start with “Don’t empathize.” It starts with “You’re not required to respect feelings that COME FROM PRIVILEGE.” Then it gives you a handy list of what those feelings look like.
Which is again great! At least at first. You’ve got a WHOLE DAMN LIST of annoying shit you don’t have to pretend not to be annoyed by! You get to let your hair down.
But… again, there’s a trick to it. Quick now: Which of a white person’s feelings are “white feelings?” The defensive ones? Okay, maybe. But what if they’re feeling more defensive today than yesterday? Are their feelings whiter? Are more of their feelings white?
What you’ve actually got is a handy dandy checklist…
**…that trains you to see someone else’s feelings as irrelevant.**
Because there actually ISN’T a way to make sure*the feelings a privileged person is having*are “privileged feelings.” The whole thing is bunkum.
You STILL have to empathize with other people. There’s STILL no way out of that that doesn’t involve becoming a jerkwad.
And then once most people think you’re a jerkwad? You’re hooked. Because the only people who think “they’re a jerkwad, but they’re OUR JERKWAD!” are guess who?
**The other people in the cult.**
So yes, it happens. 
Be VERY VERY wary of anyone who tells you they have a hall pass to sometimes be mean with your name calligraphied on it in many exciting whorls. 
Everyone is mean sometimes, and no one is required to be nice 100% of the time. And often, people get mean because they’re legitimately tired, or angry, or tired of being angry.
That’s all true.
*But anyone who’s***making that a selling point***is probably far more interested in using you than saving you.*

Was thinking about this more, and a warning sign for this kind of culty leftism:
“Your friends are problematic. Don’t listen to them.”
One of cults’ classic tactics (and abusive individuals’, too) is to separate you from your support system so that you will rely on them, and them only, for the general emotional support that every person needs.
SJ works by explaining that our society is unjust, but that it’s often unjust in insidious ways. 
It’s become gauche to say, to use a horrible but pretty clear example “black people are inferior” openly, at least in some places. So the phrasing is “but the standardized tests!” or “but dads in prison!” or any number of things you’re supposed to infer are the fault of black people just Being Like That in some way.
SJ calls attention to these things and rightly asks, “What is the intended inference here?” It lays bare some of the moves in the propaganda.
A side effect of this is that we begin to realize that sometimes behavior in our communities or friend groups are… not great. I chose this example because my best friend in college, who I clung to like a bedazzled barnacle, was a poor white gay man who was enamored of what I now think is white drag culture making fun of poor black women. 
He thought it was honoring them, and found it funny because some of the ways he’d been mocked as “poor white trash” felt similar to him. For my part, I was never poor and certainly never considered “white trash,” and I mean, RuPaul said it was okay, so…
Etc.
But bad SJ doesn’t just say “think a bit more about that thing your buddy likes.” It tells you that if your buddy doesn’t engage with the criticisms in the way THEY say they should, your buddy *is bad*, and not only should you stop defending them but you should probably find better friends.
The problem is that dropping a friend has different valences. If you’re not hanging out with that one acquaintance any more, it’s a small blow to your support system, but you have more. The center of the web is intact.
If it’s your bestie you’re being pressured to ditch, and you do it… the center of the web is a big fuckin’ hole now. And that’s exactly what cults want. “We’ll help you rebuild, and without racist white boy! …why are you sad? He was racist!”
Etc.
I’m not saying don’t think about whether your friends’ views are good or bad, or tolerate your friends being hurtful, or assume something is only bad if someone other than your friend does it, or anything like that. 
But I am saying that when an online group you’re wanting to get into or wanting to appease chants your close friend’s worst fault as though summoning Candyman or Bloody Mary… you get to think for yourself about that. You SHOULD think for yourself about that.
However privileged you are or your friend is, you get to tell them gtfo.

I agree with all of this, tbh, and I think it’s also important to note that the next step in normalizing ignoring the feelings of others is by abusing the idea of “intersectionality.” Used correctly, this is a great thing that combats the tactics that split minorities to make us easier targets. But, once culty SJ has you nodding along to “we no longer have to pander to [historically privileged group] feelings!!!” It becomes a very very short and easy step from that to shaming the opinions you don’t like from people (even in your own minority group!) who have any “privileged” identity by yelling at them that they’re using that “privilege” (I use privilege in quotes here because i see this tactic used on people who are absolutely not privileged in any way that helps them with the situation at hand). It becomes easy to say to people who have any “privileged” identity that their struggles with discrimination are not valid topics of complaint because some people in more/different groups have it harder, and therefore they should shut up and show some support. It changes from a tool to bring us together to a tool that tears us apart. And it also makes it easier for another type of cult to swoop in. To take TERFs again (they don’t deserve a whole island), they can swoop in and say “no no your struggles as a lesbian are valid, tell us all about them.” They can place themselves in the role of the understanding group that just doesn’t like how those mean old trans folks treat cis people. And to someone who has just been told by what was theoretically their “people” that their struggles and feelings are invalid, this can be incredibly powerful. They can start to slip in their ideology by pointing all that hurt at “those people who caused it”. This is TERF recruiting. This is MRA recruiting. This is how it starts, not with people who are already bad and want to hate. Just with people who can be wedged away from the community they’re a part of.

Yeah, this is absolutely true.

Like, I’m a white nonbinary disabled AFAB person. Suppose I’m arguing about housing policy with a black able-bodied cis man.

There are people who say they can tell by those lists who is right and who is wrong. There are people who say it’s the person with more oppressions, and there are people who say some oppressions tend to have heavier weight than others.

But deciding who’s right before we open our mouths… doesn’t actually make any sense. 

It might be the case that he’s more affected because redlining. It might be the case that I am because limited accessible/visitable housing stock. Or there might be no way to “decide” because *those things are both bad.*

Or whatever have you.

Identities can be an important piece of information, but they can also be a weird bludgeon.

(Also, it’s entirely possible that the white guy who interjects, even if he sounds high and mighty, is more correct than either of us. Just because sometimes identities are relevant to the discussion doesn’t mean*people with relevant identities can’t be wrong*, either.)

Cults run on (among other things) inspiring fun emotions in their targets. Elation, belonging, righteousness, power, bloodlust. Just like a drug dealer hooking you in with free samples, except the intent is to own you by becoming your supply, your lifeline, your only source of well-being.
If the target values a just world, then things like “it’s your turn to be on top” and “your anger is holy” and “people have stolen things from you and it’s time to take them back” can sound correct, and questions like “should anyone be “on top?” and “is my expression of anger harmful (to its targets? to my cause? to me?)” and “are the people accused of this theft the ones who actually did it? WHAT was stolen in actuality, and by whom? CAN I get it back? what would do in place of it?” get neatly shuffled out of mind so you don’t even think to ask them.
The thing about cults, more than anything else, is that they warp you, and they’ll look like the best thing that ever happened to you until you’re in too deep to cause problems. They’re a baited hook, and they are really damn good at making the bait seem too good to pass up.

Once again  [@kyraneko](https://tmblr.co/mZHP7It6Oxpu1KHmgXUfQsA)  says in one post what I have tried to say in what is it three now? Four? Idefk.
I have seen SO MANY bad sj posts that are like “anger is GOOD ACTUALLY. anger is how you change the world.”

and like.

it’s not false. (which is why it works as a recruitment tactic!) 

but “being angry about injustice can motivate you to start doing things” doesn’t tell you anything about whether the things you’ve started doing are the right ones to achieve or make it easier in the long run to achieve your goal of fixing [Injustice #7213563].

In order to know THAT, you have to do very boring shit like look into, record, and analyze the effects of the actions you took, and replace the actions that didn’t do much with actions that are more effective.

Online is a great spot for cult recruitment (on the left or on the right, actually) of the “we’re gonna make the stuff better” sort

PRECISELY BECAUSE everyone knows that it’s hard to know how much of an effect you have over the ‘Net, so people won’t blame you for yelling about an issue but not DOING much to fix it.

Which eventually leads to, you know, “TERFS DNI” or “IF YOU DON’T LEAVE HP FANDOM YOU ARE A CLUELESS TRANSPHOPE WHO VALUES FICTION RATHER THAN TRANS LIVES” and other performative stuff, but… not really to the less yelly stuff like, “someone said an ugly thing about [slur] at the bar yesterday and I said 'uh, Phil, what gives?’”
