Hey, sorry for barging in, but you renlig a lot from biggest-gaudiest-patronuses, who really seems to be a quite tiresome person, and has done several weird things. I hope I don't sound mad, I'm just telling you so you know. Hope you're staying safe and having a good day :^)

hey, you should be sorry! this is shitty behavior and you don’t seem like a very nice person yourself. hope you never do anything this petty, small-minded, and rude ever again. bye! (^:

okay, so it seems like you could use a more complete explanation about why your behavior was shitty, and i will take it in good faith that your intentions were to help me. 
firstly: telling people who they should and should not follow based on your opinion of people is presumptuous and rude. you are assuming that you know better than other people about who they should be friends with and what they should like. you are assuming that your judgement is better than a stranger’s. you are assuming that your opinions are correct. you are assuming you have the right to tell other people how to live their life. all of that is very rude. why did you assume i hadn’t read gaud’s call outs myself, and decided they were bullshit? you assumed you were saving me from stupidity or bad decisions. rude.
secondly: no one ever really thinks they hate someone ‘just’ for being autistic. they hate that person for being weird, for having a strange or different sense of humor, for being ‘embarrassing’, for being too opinionated or having the wrong kinds of opinions, for refusing to apologize for the way they live and the things they say, or for not apologizing properly. autistic people are always going to be weird. this is always going to make allistic people uncomfortable. eventually you have to see that ‘uncomfortable’ isn’t the same as ‘hurt’, and ‘offended’ isn’t the same as ‘victimized’. 
i have watched dozens of autistic people on tumblr get ‘cancelled’ because they get popular for being creative, clever, funny, and principled, then eventually someone takes offense and calls them out on a bunch of stupid, trumped-up charges that basically boil down to ‘they didn’t care that i don’t like them, they have principles i disagree with, they like stuff i don’t want them to, they’re less than perfectly gracious to the people who attack them’. it’s never about the autism…..but you know what, it is. it really is. it plays out this way every single time. 
i don’t care that gaud was rude to people. i don’t care that gaud made some shitty jokes that didn’t go over well. i seriously don’t care what porn they like; frankly i don’t want to know. i think they’re interesting and i want to see what they have to say, and i think that my dashboard is my business. if you don’t like what i reblog, it is on you to unfollow me. i am not someone who can be told what to do by people i don’t even know. 
this is the final thing: i do not know you. you do not know me. you tried to get me on your team (nice and good people) against people like gaud (weird and problematic people) without realizing that frankly, i am ongaud’s team against you. ‘ew, why would you hang out with a freak like that’ is something a lot of autistic people hear a whole lot of during school and if you can’t see how shitty that is and how angry we eventually become at having to hear it, i don’t know how to explain it to you. it is extremely depressing to grow up and still be subjected to it. 
so, in summary: you meant to do a good and nice thing. but the thing is actually very mean and rude. if you want to be a good and nice person, do not do it again. 
Just wanna highlight: “i have watched dozens of autistic people on tumblr get ‘cancelled’ because they get popular for being creative, clever, funny, and principled, then eventually someone takes offense and calls them out on a bunch of stupid, trumped-up charges that basically boil down to ‘they didn’t care that i don’t like them, they have principles i disagree with, they like stuff i don’t want them to, they’re less than perfectly gracious to the people who attack them’. **it’s never about the autism…..but you know what, it is. it really is. it plays out this way every single time.**”
