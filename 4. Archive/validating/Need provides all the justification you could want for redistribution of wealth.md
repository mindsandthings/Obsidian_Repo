Honestly, fuck guilt, fuck reparations. what a load of petty bourgeois moralistic horse shit. Need is all you should care about, and provides all the justification you could want for redistribution of wealth.

It's important to understand the history of European colonialism in order to understand why Africa is underdeveloped. But it doesn't matter in a moral sense: there should be a redistribution of wealth from Europe to Africa not because of the historical injustice, but because that is required to satisfy the needs of the peoples of Africa.
