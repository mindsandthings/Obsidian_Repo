a lot of children - especially mentally ill children - end up traumatized not because someone was specifically hurting them but because their needs weren’t being met, or because their problems weren’t being seen, or because they were rendered particularly vulnerable by other aspects of their identity, like queerness or race. 
and it can be hard to look at your childhood and go “I was hurt” and also know that the hurt wasn’t deliberate. it’s uniquely painful to not have someone to blame. 
you do not have to excuse the people who hurt you, even if it was unintentional. & acknowledging your own pain does not necessarily entail blaming them for it.
you are allowed to do what you need to do in order to recover. 

Also:
“they did the best they could/with what they had” and “it wasn’t (good) enough” are two things that can and must be true at the same time

.

This is a very real and legit type of trauma called Trauma B, which in short means that you weren’t given the things that you needed to survive and thrive, and I believe that it’s the culprit for way to many things and we need to understand and talk about it more.
(Trauma A is the type where something happens to you)

it’s uniquely painful to not have someone to blame.
