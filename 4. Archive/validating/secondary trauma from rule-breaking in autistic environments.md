I think that people who are heavily socially traumatized in authoritarian environments, who have internalized people pleasing or obedience display/fawning as a survival mechanism, experience extreme fear/threat reactions when they see someone break a rule, even if it’s a new rule, a rule that only some people agree on, etc. Part of that algorithm goes, “must offend NO ONE, EVER. Must please EVERY PERSON.”

Yes, they genuinely are triggered
