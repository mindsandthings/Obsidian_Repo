[frustrations with how they respond]
For example, writing an autistic character who's so stressed she's having meltdowns and hearing that she needs to be put under more pressure. 

I used to think that the answer was to explain the motivations of autistic characters a little more than those of neurotypical characters, but what I've found in practice is that readers (or, at least, critiquers) don't want motivation explained because it slows down the action.

Thanks, Jess and Maya. I think a lot of this is non-obvious from the outside and some of it's not always obvious to autistic people (often it's 

Here's some info about why she doesn't seek out a lot of interactions with other people, and why she doesn't have the focus on physical action that Aimee does. I'm going to send some info about backstory and character arc, and also about her scenes having a lot of description and internals. I might ask for some specific kinds of feedback on the description/internals for future chapters. 

tl;dr: Bellflower doesn't like to interact with other people, both due to the reasons I mentioned yesterday and because it's effortful for other reasons, plus most people don't like her very much outside of work contexts. She doesn't have a lot of action scenes, partly due to physical limitations and partly due to the fact that she hasn't left the castle yet. I might be able to shift most of the stuff from the scene you read for Sunday to the next scene, where she's in the Dungeon Crawl's tavern, though. I might also be able to rework some of her "Exposition chapter TBD" chapter into a sign-language-based scene with Fennel at the message desk set earlier that morning.

More info if desired (heads-up that some of this is a lot heavier than what I sent yesterday): 

Not liking to interact with other people

So, Bellflower doesn't like to interact with people. Especially in person, but also in general. That's partly due to the auditory processing and speech issues I mentioned earlier. There are other reasons like masking, pervasive negative and/or disinterested responses from other people, and chronic social trauma. 

 - Masking: masking is trying to look and act as neurotypical as possible. Because it's not something we do automatically, we have to consciously think our way through doing it while also dealing with the other demands of social interaction (auditory processing, managing sensory issues, managing emotions). It's effortful, takes a lot of energy, it gets in the way of actually developing meaningful connections with other people, and it exacerbates mental health issues. Most people I know who've grown up masking aren't able to turn it off, even when they'd like to, and at the point the only way not to mask is not to interact. 

Bellflower grew up in an environment where in addition to the standard pressure most autistic people get to mask, she was also getting intense pressure from tutors and Shadow Marketing. 

 - Most neurotypical people don't respond well to delays in speech processing, too little or too much eye contact, or unfamiliar body language, especially when that body language conveys anxiety and overwhelm in response to interacting with the other person. Autistic people also tend to have difficulty inferring implicit social norms, difficulty picking up on social dominance hierarchies, and often have a strong sense of justice and fairness that leads to creating friction. We make weird assumptions and misjudge situations. We get weirdly passionate about specific areas of interest and don't always know (or manage) to shut up about them (I can keep myself from doing this in person, but as you may have noticed, I have trouble not doing it in writing). 

There's just a lot of stuff going on. (Other stuff, too: difficulty conforming to gender role expectations, being way more likely to be queer, being more likely to have other disabilities, etc. Also, I haven't gone into this because it's not my place to go on about, but everything I've talking about is amped up for non-white autistics, especially in situations involving authority figures and situations where it's dangerous to misread social cues.)

Even when we're masking heavily, people pick up on it eventually, although in those cases they usually attribute it to being inconsider or malicious. Reactions from neurotypical people to us at the good end tend to be polite acquaintanceship that doesn't go deeper, but reactions that range from indifferent to hostile aren't uncommon. 

Most people don't like Bellflower (outside of work contexts where she's in demand due to there not being enough spellworkers to go around) and she picks up on it. We tend to get along better with other autistic people, and to some extent people who are similarly neurodivergent (like non-autistic people who have ADHD such as Aimee). 

 - Chronic social trauma, in particular communication trauma. This includes stuff like: people just not liking us, people wanting to get status from expelling an unliked person from a group, people suddenly getting really angry when they lose patience, people not believing us about sensory/auditory/social issues, and abusers who selectively target people who don't have social connections to protect them. Most if not all autistic people I know have significant social trauma, often at CPTSD levels and usually ongoing. It's difficult to get it addressed because it's usually not seen as plausible enough or bad enough to have actually caused trauma. 

Bellflower's fairly typical in this respect. 


Lack of physical action

My comments here are mostly about action scenes. I think there's room for Bellflower to do more (low-key) action, although I'm not sure how to do it. 

About half of autistic people have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome Type III aka hypermobility, a genetic connective tissue disorder. Connective tissue is in almost every part of your body and EDS symptoms are vast and wide-ranging, although some of the more common symptoms are joint damage and dislocations, pain, and fatigue. Bellflower has EDS along with issues stemming from spending a long time in the completely non-magical human realm. 

That's why she doesn't have a lot of action scenes. I've cheated some by giving her medical spells and by giving her access to the ethereal plane (the virtual-reality-style environment where the selvage islands are), where her health problems don't matter much. 

(To avoid potential confusion and because I don't want to seem like I'm claiming something I'm not, I don't have EDS but I do have a couple conditions that commonly co-occur with it. Those suck too, but I'm very glad not to have joint problems.)

There's room for more low-key action but I'm not sure how to do it. When she's using the chat app, she's either focused on the conversation (which means not much action) or going back and forth between action and chat. Because the action is separate from the chat—neither Aimee or Error are physically there—it's hard to make the action complementary rather than a distraction. With Aimee, the action is the point and the chats are supplemental, but I need to get Error through the existing chunks of development before Bellflower gets to the Dungeon Crawl puzzle room. I might be able to shift most of the stuff from her travel preparedness room onward into the scene with her at the Dungeon Crawl's tavern, though. 






Long descriptive sections / internals

	•	Some autistic people are super-wordy and ramble a lot. (You don't say, Noe.) 
	•	
	•	
	•	Some of the issues with wordiness in Bellflower's sections are due to a problem specifically with me that I don't know how to solve, which is that I have trouble prioritizing information because it all looks equally important. Even when I try very hard to figure out what is and isn't important, it still looks equally important. It's also hard for me to tell *when* something is relevant so I can slip it in only at that particular time. (I would actually appreciate specific feedback on this, with the caveat that sometimes there's stuff that doesn't look immediately relevant but still has to go somewhere, so I can't always axe it.)

****also some stuff about action here


Stuck in the past, themes of the novel

Bellflower grew up with 

The current queen has a lot of control over her role and a lot of experience. She's not planning to turn over any meaningful degree of power while alive, but due to political pressure she needs someone else to appear to be in control. 

Being the Unseelie Queen is a combined diplomat-celebrity-CEO role. 


The Courts are a little like a city or county, but everyone who lives there has to be employed by the Courts and can be fired. 

If she declines, her mother can kick her out of the Courts. Her medical spells are tied to the Courts, so if she leaves, she loses healthcare access. She has a complicated situation (real-world complex chronic health issues combined with damage from spending too long in the zero-magic human realm) and can't get similar treatment without financial and social leverage that isn't available to her otherwise. (This is similar to the common scenario where someone winds up dependent on their abuser for healthcare access.)

Bellflower is about to lose the autonomy she had when in her spellworker role and 

She's also staying in part because she's worried that otherwise her mother will search harder for her sister. She left the Courts after a particularly blatant incident of child abuse in her teens, 
If an autistic person has talent and skills and can mask well enough to get hired, they might be valued at their job, depending on the social environment at the job. Usually you have to be hypercompetent but that can also result in people sabotaging you, so it's kind of a double-edged sword. If you do complicated stuff that no one else likes to do (like doing tech stuff for people who are less tech-savvy) it tends to work better.

Bellflower likes some parts of her spellwork job a lot, and people appreciate the fact that she fixes things for them. Doing programming work in the human realm also worked well for her. 

occupying the "cishet white male autistic geek / programmer" space. That's less accessible to other people, but it's not always completely inaccessible



hypervisibility, high social demands


introspection: can't afford to be outside our heads

but it's also very specifically bad to try to force her to be someone she isn't, and a large part of her character arc has to do with 

Dehumanization and mandatory neurotypicality

but I would also like for her to have a story that fits her, instead of my making her more neurotypical so that she can fit into a more standard story. 

It's possible that there isn't any actual way to put her on the page that will be liked by people who don't share her specific experiences. That's definitely true in real life. 

I'm already cheating to some extent by giving her a spellwork virtual-reality-style environment (which is more relevant for several scenes late in the book). 

It's very common for us to feel that we're not being people correctly, or not being human correctly, because most of the feedback we get is that we're failing 

Almost all of us get sent that message on an implicit level, and some people get it on an explicit level. There's a "trapped behind a glass wall" metaphor invoked by some parenting movements - anti-vaxxers particularly - which involves the idea that an autistic kid is actually a completely normal neurotypical kid 


"be yourself", but "yourself" is always someone's imagined you, the you that's better than the actual you. Part of the reason these chapters aren't as much fun as Aimee's and Chrys's chapters is that she's being herself. 

Sometimes this is super-explicit, like when 

Like, we see people all around us who can just be human effortlessly

It isn't voluntary. Nobody volunteers for experiences that send you the consistent message that you're failing the most basic requirements of being a human. 

Contrast this with Aimee: Aimee's neurodivergent enough that she has some experience of alienation, but allistic enough that people still like her, and some of her ADHD-driven special interests (makeup and fashion) are feminine enough that she 

Aimee doesn't have any chronic health issues. She's athletic and has high stamina. Chrys has social superpowers and can hold her own in a fight, and doesn't have chronic health issues other than vertigo when she uses her conduit. 

and the kind of social paranoia that happens to socially dominant women who spend a lot of time in mostly-female environments where any apparent lack of compliance
