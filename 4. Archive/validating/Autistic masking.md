 Paraphrasing, the ideas we came to are as follows:


 One of the reasons masking can be so difficult to recognize is because, essentially, masking is the act of performing “yourself” as a mirror for the other person you are interacting with.

I was talking to a client today about “how to identify masking” as part of the process of learning how to shift masking from a reflexive coping strategy to a voluntary and conscious one and I feel like it led to a really important shift in framework FOR ME about masking and social distress.

Paraphrasing, the ideas we came to are as follows:

> One of the reasons masking can be so difficult to recognize is because, essentially, masking is the act of performing “yourself” as a mirror for the other person you are interacting with. It’s this idea of “I will micro-manage my own mood, affect, behavior, mannerisms, and environment in order to reflect back to you whatever version of "self” you need from me because if I don’t there will be consequences". So because masking is essentially performing “mirroring” as selfhood by amplifying or minimizing aspects of yourself based on what you think the other person wants to see in you, it varies significantly from one context to another. The major commonality is that it takes up an INCREDIBLE amount of energy, mental and emotional resources, cognitive processing power, etc. So you don’t identify masking by specific behaviors so much as by the feeling of “having a significant amount of your mental/emotional resources be occupied by the act of social interaction” to the point that it doesn’t leave enough left-over for other cognitive tasks, or leaves you feeling exhausted and worn out, or basically by the impact that masking has on you during and after.

> In this framework, part of why we get so anxious about new or unfamiliar people or situations is because we don’t know how to mask in that context yet, and so until we get there and figure it out, we’re basically just terrified of what could go wrong since we don’t know what we’re walking into.\*

> _\*This is the underlying framework of anticipatory and obsessive anxiety as well. Anticipatory and obsessive anxiety functions as the mechanism by which we conduct both predictive reasoning-basd advance planning and review/self-correctionof our mental predictive model._

> Autistic aversion to uncertainty has a lot to do with our need to be able to use predictive reasoning-based advance planning to cope with “social deficits” aka how much harder it is for us to interpret subtextual/nonverbal cues, learn/meet social expectations, and work through/around disordered sensory processing. That predictive reasoning requires us to be familiar, in advance, with the stable constant factors that influence decision making in social contexts. If we aren’t familiar with the constant variables than we can’t plan, if we can’t plan than we are more likely to make noticeable social mis-steps, and if we take notable social mis-steps there are consequences. It becomes necessary for us to be hypervigilent to observable patterns in other people’s behavior in order to try to reverse engineer the social interaction playbook on the fly. That ends up making us more likely to assume personal responsibility for predicting and managing the emotional regulatory needs of people around us at all costs, replicating the behavioral/cognitive impacts of chronic traumatic stress due to the activation of our sympathetic nervous system from chronic hypervigilence.

> Essentially, masking is a cognitive defense mechanism to severe and/or persistant traumatic interpersonal stressors. As the neurological impacts of chronic traumatic stress heal, we mask less frequently. But in order to heal from chronic traumatic stress, the human brain requires a safe environment that does not trigger a retraumatization episode or replicate feelings of helplessness/fear for safety. In other words, reducing/terminating masking safely requires us as autistic people to have consistent access to social environments in which we are able to utilize autistic interpersonal boundaries without fear of consequence or chonically unmet need. This requires the people around us to be able to respect not only autistic interpersonal boundaries, but also autistic self-expression/advocacy modalities and mediums.

I feel like a lot of the pieces of this framework have been rattling around in my head for a while but the flavor of words hit just right today and all the connections snapped into place.

Anyway, I’m still sort of sorting through the clinical implications of this framework but I think it’s a direction I want to keep exploring for sure.
