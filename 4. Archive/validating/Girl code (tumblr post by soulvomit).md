Some weird social observations that only clicked for me as of my late 30s, regarding “girl code,” and how odd women often fail at it:

Tons of “girl code” (this is language we were using around some of this stuff in the 90s-00s) unwritten social rules are based on survival and about whether or not women trust other women to have their back, and are about signaling who is on who’s side. There are a ton of these little signals that it’s easy to miss if you haven’t been socialized around it. I had to learn these late because I was raised by a mother who doesn’t get these signals at all and I didn’t even know they existed. I had to deduce the existence of some kind of a “girl code.” (Actually I picked up some of this stuff during a phase in which I consumed a lot of really really mainstream fiction. It was enlightening.)   Normie NT women are operating on some kind of level of psychic power I’ll never begin to understand, relaying simultaneous messages back and forth and beaming them around the room. This is a kind of thing that even being ADHD would interfere with and I don’t think that you have to necessarily be autistic to be socially hampered by your radio not picking up the Girl Code Channel. There is a way in which normie women are required to socially _overfunction_ and expect other women to do so as well. 

The thing with having to socially signal disgust about the right things? Well, there are reasons for that which completely hold up within the normie system. Within that framework, they make complete sense. You have to say “ew” at the right times, about the right movie scenes, you have to not laugh at the same jokes men laugh at. But it’s okay because humor doesn’t really carry the same social currency here anyway. You can actually be a complete bore as long as you signal at the right times that you’re in on the Girl Code. Learning this was actually somewhat liberating for my masking because it meant I could sit there completely still and say nothing as long as I just nodded at the right times and went “ew” at the right times (see: “making Empathy Noises”) and this could be performed rather mindlessly, and on “automatic pilot” for limited duration. Knowing *this* stuff actually is the kind of thing that lets me get away with being a little weird because in many cases people are not looking at whether or not you tap your foot x number of times unless you’re being annoying about it, they’re looking for signs you’re going to violate some invisible social barrier. 

There is this way that normie (white? upper middle class?) NT women signal disgust/repulsion to each other as some kind of safety signal. A woman who did *not* signal being disgusted or repulsed by particular things, could not (and possibly should not) be counted upon.  

Normie NT women rely on other women to “get” this signal and to give it back. It has reasons for existing that are a cold calculus of survival and normie women know that other women who don’t “get” the signal, or who are likely to side with men, are going to potentially either hit on their husband or abandon them at the bar. And many of those women are or aren’t more likely to hit on their husband, or abandon them at the bar. One of the most painful things to recognize is that a big source of our problems is that normie women’s social rules don’t exist for _nothing_, exactly. 

Within patriarchal cultures, normie women’s entire social world is set up around invisible boundaries and invisible social currency and invisible signals to other women, and invisible status.    

I learned to compensate for not directly seeing many of these boundaries. It’s actually hard to really begin to pin down where just being otherwise raised outside of these spaces (so the externally visible dynamics sometimes become very visible to me, from a distance) begins and or being ND (because I literally just miss so much stuff) leaves off. I literally can’t tell. This is one of those cases where sometimes I think I’m some kind of edge case because I would appear to socially function better than a lot of autistics (based upon having a support system and a partner, and being able to interact in a variety of day to day interactions and work interactions) which lends credence to myself not being autistic sometimes but at the same time by the standards of what autism was as an optic in the 1990s this was a very autistic post. That is an irony of today.
