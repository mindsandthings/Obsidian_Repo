[“If you’ve been told your whole life that you are worthless, what good is your word? When I have done political organizing in a lesbian context, one of the things that I learned there was that we had a constituency of people, many of whom had been told all their lives that they were nothing. Many had never had or used power, did not know how to be proactive, **felt that their only power was to be obstructive.** A lot of times lesbians would come into a room determined that the only way they could express themselves was to stop something. When we created the Lesbian Avengers in 1992, we had to create a rule that if you disagreed with a proposal you couldn’t just critique it; you had to make a better suggestion. This drove people wild because they didn’t have the skill or authority to be proactive and create things, to negotiate, to face and deal with problems, to propose solutions. **They only knew how to obstruct and destroy.** That’s what you’re dealing with here. We have it on a lot of different fronts. If we take your idea and expand it—what you are talking about is a real gay family.”]
