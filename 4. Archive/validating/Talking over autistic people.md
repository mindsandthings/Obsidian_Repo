I really don’t want to post this because everyone will misinterpret it, but I would like to see a discussion on this website that brings in autism in a way that’s not “autistic people using their autism as an excuse to talk over marginalized people” JUST ONCE

okay, so autistic people are overrepresented in online communities. this is a thing that other people have reported on and pointed out.

the internet has this weird fucking motivation to arrange “marginalized identities” in little stair steps in like some kind of tier list, figuring out who is the Most Privileged or Most Oppressed, and who has the right to “speak over” who. Now obviously this doesn’t work. Like “who is more marginalized, a white trans person or a disabled Jewish person” is like asking “Which has a greater volume, 27 degrees Kelvin or 8.6 centimeters?”

what I feel has happened, and I hate it so much, is that people online and especially on tumblr have started to view autism as like, “marginalization lite,” like to the utmost level. Marginalization Zero Calorie. this is partly because there are so many autistic people on the internet, many of which who have Privileged Takes on issues because they are privileged in other ways (I mean, obviously??)

but when people’s most hated white fandom blogger or tumblr funnyman or whoever is autistic and they have crappy ideas, of course people want to dunk them in a single monolithic Privileged category rather than in a single monolithic Marginalized category because people are bad at nuance.

but what this has led to is people just straight up fucking thinking that autism itself is just a little character quirk and doesn’t deserve to be ever discussed or recognized outside of “flappy hands are cute” and because white autistic fandom blogger 17’s autism doesn’t give them the right to “talk over” other marginalized people, that must mean autism is a “smaller” thing than all other marginalizations, right?

and since autistic people are so...visible? and get into these conversations so frequently online? autism has been put into the Privileged category so much and so thoroughly that I think people are legitimately straight up fucking incapable of understanding how autism could be life altering and “othering” and the very real ways that growing up as an autistic person is almost inescapably traumatic and how profoundly hostile the world is to autistic people or even why this is important to talk about

I’m so bad at articulating this but like, shitty white fandom bloggers being autistic and not recognizing their privilege doesn’t mean that autism itself is primarily an excuse to use in internet arguments and therefore doesn’t need to be discussed on its own or legitimately considered as a type of perspective. That doesn’t mean that’s the extent of what autism is.

Like please don’t let your dislike of a handful of prominent internet personas completely destroy your sympathy for autistic people and autistic issues. Please.

like my life experience is still totally alien to other people and I don’t even have the vocabulary to explain it. it’s still taken me years to discover relatively basic facts about why certain things hurt me or how I can live my life. there are no “autistic voices” there is no “autistic literature” just…compiled and accessible, there is not some sort of plentiful well of context and explanation I can turn to for my life. I look at the research being published and people are still fucking arguing about whether autistic people have the capacity to care about others.

I grew up with a sign on my back that everyone but me could read. Like, imagine growing up with the pervasive sense that everyone else KNOWS something is wrong with you, but you don’t know what. I was uncanny-valley-zoned as a kid, I think. That DID affect how I developed. And so did everything else. It’s not just a footnote, it’s a fundamental part of being a person for me. It affects what I can eat, what I can wear, all of my relationships, my ability to get a job. I can’t have neurotypical sex or maintain a neurotypical workout routine or run a neurotypical errand because the way my senses work is something I am constantly, constantly, constantly having to grapple with in a world that was not designed for it and with people that can’t always understand it using vocabulary that only approximately describes it.

like shit, I can barely even go to a doctor because the people who treated me as a kid inadvertently traumatized me not knowing anything about my needs as an autistic kid, and I had to piece this together myself because Literally No One has bothered to talk about it except like ONE article on one website that took forever to find, and a handful of other autistic people who have directly messaged me. I’m trying to investigate the link between anxiety and autism, but there isn’t a sign pointing to the random forum post in the black hole of the internet where someone will be like “me too.”

And I can’t even begin to expound upon how comparatively lucky I was and how relatively untraumatized I am? I’m still basically feeling around in the dark, but at least I got diagnosed? (At least I’m not still stuck with ‘Theres something wrong with me but I don’t know what?’) At least I wasn’t traumatized by abusive therapy? At least the bullying I got from peers wasn’t severe by comparison? At least I was accommodated well enough to be able to go to college? At least I’m not dead?

Maybe unpopular opinion but perhaps we DO need to work on autism awareness before autism acceptance because there needs to be uhhhhh a little bit deeper of an understanding of autism than maybe a basic definition of stimming??
