I don't think that's a fair comparison because they're so different. Some public schools (especially in America) are horrible, and lots of kids get bullied or have unaccommodating faculty, and that can be a lot worse with neurodivergancy.

Homeschooling I would say is worse because it has no regulations and it gives the parents far, far too much power, and it's just not good for a kid to be around their parents 24/7 until they're 18. Plus, lack of professional educators is a _huge_ problem. Isolation is a big thing too, and lack of opportunities, like it's pretty hard to join any clubs or anything, and the ones that are there would be underfunded or sketchy.

For experiences, homeschooling is on average far worse, and also it's more isolating. When a public schooled kid talks about their school issues, it gets a chorus of sympathy, which is good! But when I voice my grievances of homeschooling in any community that isn't _explicitly_ for people who also had issues with homeschooling, I get either shouted down by crazy homeschool moms or kids saying how they wished they could be homeschooled.

Tl;dr: it's not a fair comparison, but overall homeschooling is worse.
