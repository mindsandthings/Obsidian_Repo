# Autism privilege [posted Tumblr]
So many of my spaces are increasingly hostile toward autistic people, especially diversity-related spaces. Often it’s not even explicit; it’s just a lack of visible acknowledgement that neurodivergence is relevant or meaningful combined with intense moralization of perfect social performance and an everpresent threat of being made an example of.

With diversity spaces in particular, it’s like someone took the absolute worst aspects of teenage neurotypical girl bully culture and decided it was the right way to increase fairness. Bullies get and keep power by bullying people into compliance. Bullies target autistic people because we're an easy win; we usually don't have access to the social support needed to protect us, and we're often so familiar with social trauma that they can flip us into a response beneficial to them, like a fawn response (in which case the bully gets instant compliance), a flee response (in which case they don't have to put up with us existing in their presence anymore), or a fight response (in which case obviously we're just incredibly privileged, because who responds negatively to abuse, and also obviously it proves we're unstable).  

Autistic people’s access needs are real (even when they’re inconvenient! even when they conflict with other people’s access needs! even when those other people are not disabled!). Our experiences are really, genuinely, meaningfully different, in too many ways to list; we’re not just experiencing different sensory and social and cognitive environments some of the time because autism doesn’t have an off switch. And most of us have been exposed to a wide variety of trauma. A lot of it is trauma that’s still being inflicted on us and will continue to be inflicted on us in the future. Most of us have been (and are, and will keep being) gaslit around it. We have high rates of bad shit happening to us, and we especially have low access to social connections and social support. And many neurotypical people—including a lot of people who are marginalized in other ways—really, really don’t realize just how little social connection and support it’s possible to have, or just how extensive the impacts of not having it are, or how much not having it fucks you up.

Acknowledging this makes it really obvious that bullies who target autistic people for personal gain are being appallingly shitty, and so they have every incentive to try to 1) deny that autism is relevant to an interaction in any way, 2) try to link autism with racist/bigoted/other shitty behavior in people's minds, and 3) try to conflate autism with privilege. Because that way they can punch the autistic people in their own spaces and everyone will cheer them for "punching up". 

If someone looks at the autistic people in their spaces and sees them as privileged, sometimes that’s because those spaces are making themselves so inaccessible for autistic people that only autistic people who are relatively privileged can actually manage to enter and stay in them. 

When a space has a disproportionate number of autistic people in it (like with some online spaces), it's generally because the normal everyday spaces most people get to access as a matter of a course are inaccessible or hostile to us. 

Some people really want to make all spaces inaccessible to autistic people, especially spaces where we have a voice and some level of comfort and some ability to make the social norms less hostile to us. And they work very hard at weaponizing the concepts of privilege and diversity and oppression and marginalization against autistic people in any place where those concepts have power. Which are sometimes places that were previously more accepting of autistic people because all of those concepts are really fucking relevant to our lives. 

On a slightly different topic, here are a couple compendiums of autism resources I recommend:
