re: your absolutely fair wish to have the "underlying category-belonging you can't escape" and the "terrible, but purely cultural construct about that category being superior that we can totally escape and destroy", this reminds me of people around here describing terrible relationships as "hetero culture", up to saying things like ~"well i am in a hetero-looking relationship, but i am bi, so i can have it be non-terrible". Who one is attracted to =/= patriarchal relationship rules, god damn it.
