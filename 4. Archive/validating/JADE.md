JADE?
Justify, Argue, Defend, and Explain
these are things you cannot do with abusive people, because they will not see reason and will just turn everything back on you
if you’ve been abused, you may have a bad habit of trying to JADE everything because you’re used to trying to negotiate whether or not you get to exist
