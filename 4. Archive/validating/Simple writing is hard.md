It's weird to me that people don't seem to talk about hyperlexia more often I mean most of my problems in life stem from the fact that I learned how to read before my third birthday and that's set me up for a lifetime of being broadly incomprehensible

It feels to me like as you approach mastery of a language you eventually cross a threshold beyond which you steadily become LESS effective at communicating as your grasp on that language strengthens Knowing how to "simplify" requires an entirely different kind of intelligence

And that threshold at young ages is EXTREMELY low Like hey buddy maybe your three-year-old is great at communicating with YOU, and that's a fun party trick, but now none of their classmates can understand them and it's building resentment on both sides See how that pans out

And—and I say this with no education on the subject whatsoever—advanced language skills, unlike a lot of other forms of advanced development in children, don't really appear to eventually bottleneck with everybody else If you're ahead of the curve at five, you will be at fifteen

obv I'm in my thirties now and people still rib me a lot for using words they have to look up Simplifying language isn't just a matter of swapping words out, you have to rewrite your sentence over and over until you've recaptured the complete nuance of your original sentence

So ultimately my "advanced language skills" double or triple the amount of labor I need to put into my words to say as concisely what somebody at the median level could say completely off the cuff Maybe in return listening becomes easier, but that's not always a good tradeoff

One of my classic "genie's wishes" has always been "the ability to speak all languages and dialects perfectly" but in practice a wish like that would self-monkey's-paw The impulse to codeswitch to achieve perfect linguistic precision would make it impossible to be understood

To make yourself "more broadly understandable", simplifying your language to do so, is a genuinely painful experience You're literally changing the meaning of your own words in order to convey something broadly analogous to what you meant to say It's almost like outright lying
