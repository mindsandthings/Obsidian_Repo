I suspect it would be pretty helpful for a lot of people if there was more of a concept of *contextual gender*: like, I’m female in this social context and male in this one, without either gender being necessarily false. The concept of genderfluidity seems *kind of* similar but in practice that seems to usually be used to convey someone’s gender varying from time to time within the same social context, and that looks pretty different in terms of the attendant social norms, how people want to be seen, and how people see themselves.
The idea isn’t to replace the idea of being in the closet, to be clear. It doesn’t mean that that you’re *actually* your ASAB around your family if you haven’t come out to them as trans. It’s more just that if you’re one thing with one group of people and another with a different group, and you *want* both of those to be true, they can be.
