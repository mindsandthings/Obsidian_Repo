A weird thought I’ve had lately, wrt female underdiagnosis of autism, and women who are convinced they must be autistic because they were diagnosed with ADHD but ADHD can’t possibly be what they have because they experience actual social debilitation:

Now, sure, yes, you may have autism, but also consider…

We have to consider that in the 80s and 90s, and possibly some periods beyond, ADHD was massively overdiagnosed. The pipeline for diagnosis for ADHD has always been much, much larger than that for autism. 

Public school systems (including community colleges) were willing to label a person ADHD.

This means that lots of people without ADHD, got labeled ADHD. 

So the general public has no idea what actual debilitating ADHD really looks like. 

This means that lots of people, when they think ADHD, think “someone who’s basically NT.”

They can’t imagine that ADHD is actually socially othering. Not just because ADHD has a sexier media image than autism (to the degree that you might not get diagnosed autism if the clinician finds you too attractive/interesting/fun) but because so many non-ADHD people may be carrying the ADHD label, that _they’re what we’re used to seeing and thinking of_ _as adult ADHD_. 

I know some ADHD people who as socially othered as autistic people, sometimes for the same reasons, even though those reasons have different underlying cognitive and sensory processes behind them. I don’t feel like as much modern ADHD writing talks about the social aspects of ADHD as much as older ADHD writing does.

I know ADHD people who are more socially othered than the autistic people in our spaces in fact, because the non-ADHD autistics do have masks and compliance algorithms for the social stuff they’re required to do, but the non-autistic ADHD people’s impulse control issues can make masking or following a compliance algorithm very, very hard.
