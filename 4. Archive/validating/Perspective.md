Since I’m tired and caffeinated and depressed and procrastinating…
 
Your life will be full of meaningful connections. You have no control over this. You will interact with people in your life. You will touch the lives of hundreds, thousands, and even hundreds of thousands of others. Some of those people will ascribe meaning onto your existence; some will not. Meaning can only be defined by those who experience it. That which is meaningful to you may be meaningless to others. That which is meaningless to you may have meanings you do not understand.
 
Interactions can have positive and negative consequences. They can be profound and deep and unsettling. They can be shockingly simple. They can change the course of history.
 
When you realize this, you will consider people you have touched, and people who have touched you.
 
You remember people. People will remember you. Strangers you never even saw will think of you as they draw their dying breath. They will think of you every time they read a word or see the sun or sit alone in a darkened room. You have a meaning. This is not something you can prevent.
 
You have ruined lives.
 
You have irrevocably broken somebody and you don’t even know how. You have transformed people in the worst of ways. Somebody has suffered by your hand. Somebody thinks of you during their worst moments. This cannot be changed.
 
You will ruin more lives.
 
Your life will amass to a series of destructive moments. You will be the topic of discussion through many therapy sessions and late evening phone calls. People will know of you without knowing your name. They will think of you as they hurt themselves even more and they will think of you as they grow from their own spite.
 
If the purpose of life is to change the world and leave a tangible footprint, then these are truths which you need to accept. You have an uncontainable potential to cause pain. You have already fucked up more lives than you can count. You have fucked somebody up and they will never recover.
 
Everybody has done this, and so this does not define you.
 
We are all bad people. To somebody, we have all committed the worst crime that there is to commit. We cannot control the impact we have on others; we cannot predict it nor can we prevent it. It is merely a fact of life.
