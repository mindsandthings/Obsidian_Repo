    Something something {unreasonable expectations of uncomplaining and unconditional provision of emotion work/adjacent services} vs {unreasonable expectations of emotional and material self-reliance};
    the observation that {white cis MLM} and {white cishet women} are consistently (but not in a consistent order) at the ‘bottom’/‘top’ (depending on how you look at it) of the Imaginary Privilege Totem Pole in the sorts of SJ spaces that pay a lot of attention to the IPTP - however, this plays out in different ways for each group.
    White cis MLM are supposed to fuck off now they (are assumed to) have their privilege, while white cishet women are supposed to stick around, but be everyone’s bitch.
    **\[disclaimer: this is obviously a very half-finished thought; I am talking about things that annoy me not necessarily the things that are most prevalent or important; this does not apply to all SJ spaces nor are the attitudes described solely held toward the named groups.**Ability and socioeconomic class are deliberately excluded from the list of considerations the people I am talking about normally in practice find to be important.\]
