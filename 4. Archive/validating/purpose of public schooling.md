For the most part I'm pretty cynical about public schooling, it's mostly just a result of a variety of social and political pressures such that it serves no particular purpose or even set of purposes well, it's just like... a thing that happened, and is economically useful, BUT the thing where they make kids read and talk about a weird kinda fucked up short story feels fundamentally Right to me. If you have power over a bunch of 12 year olds for an extended period of time it is your duty to make them read a weird short story. For their psychological development

tbh one of the main purpose it serves is putting kids in front of screened, unrelated adults who might notice if theyâ€™re being abused or taught absolute nonsense about the world
