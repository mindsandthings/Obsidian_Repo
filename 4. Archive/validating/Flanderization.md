i hate the term “flanderization” sometimes it’s just character development. how many people do you know in real life that are stuck in the same work/home situations for years on end who don’t slowly become parodies of themselves as their personalities get simplified to emphasize parts that get the most positive reinforcement from their surroundings as they pace the slowly tightening circle of their lives like understimulated zoo tigers
