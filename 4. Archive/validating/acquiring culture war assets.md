# [May the Bridges We Burn Light Our Way Home](https://isaacsapphire.tumblr.com/)

If you want backstory and deets, read the blog. Or just guess I'm your least favorite demographic, it's easier for you that way, and funnier for me. All non-bots who have literally anything to add to the conversation welcome here, even if we disagree on some things.

Sometimes things are just like they appear. Most things that aren’t academia or nerdy are neither like cockfighting nor like horse racing. Clam fishing on the Spanish Atlantic coast is not like cock fighting, even though it was male dominated for a long time, and women had to fight to be granted fishing licenses.

    > > Clam fishing (Or mussels fishing? I am fuzzy about the correct translation here…) is neither. It’s male-dominated because it’s physically hard work, but also because men who issued fishing licenses didn’t want to give them to women who just wanted to make a point about equality, but to men who had families to feed. If a woman had a family to feed, well, that’s not how we do things around here, she should have married a man with a fishing license.

    > > The fighting game community is like cockfighting. It’s male-dominated, and beyond that it’s AMAB-dominated in a way that is worth noting but not worth going into detail over. It’s also low-status. It’s not clear how much status the fighting game community would _deserve_, if you applied a social justice lens to it. It’s not clear how many more women would play _Smash Bros_ competitively if you made the fighting game community more welcoming but still low-status and aout fighting games.

Campaigning to get more women into cock fighting is counter-productive for different reasons. It’s not an exclusive club in the first place. Getting more women into clam fishing is not something that benefits the broader world of women across the country, but those women in particular can benefit a lot. Clam fishing is a living.

    > > But a lot of gender-based analysis and cultural criticism focuses on gender disparities in cock fighting and horse racing type groups, and pretends fixing them might help women in clam fishing type situations. Or it pretends getting women in tech to _lean in_ will somehow spill over into cockfighting type groups.

    Well, there’s that issue too, where there’s a substantial culture war type element and it’s not really about getting women into whatever (which you can tell because the three women who have been doing whatever with the guys for decades are ignored and driven out by the feminists rather than seen as foremothers) but about changing whatever _culture_. Because it’s seen as a potential culture war asset.
