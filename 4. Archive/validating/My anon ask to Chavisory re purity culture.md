Re evangelist morality in leftist spaces, this is mostly guesswork and half-ass observations but I suspect contributing factors include: 1) post-1960s conservative backlash led to a lot of girls in the 80s/90s being raised in environments that were especially shitty in gendered purity-culture ways, and when they encountered purity-culture or purity-culture-amenable strains of feminism, it absolved them of their sins and gave them the opportunity to be the ones passing out judgment (1/3)

2) increasingly mainstream support for feminism from the 1990s onward, leading to other movements wanting the same levels of influence
3) intersectional feminism rising in popularity in the 00s/10s allowed purity culture to spread outward to other movements 
4) since people in mainstream leftist spaces either are or know plenty of women who don't endorse purity-culture feminism, purity culture didn't take off in the mainstream directly from feminism, but...

5) at least for primarily-white mainstream leftist spaces, purity culture really took off when it came in via racial justice movements, because many people in (primarily-white, mainstream) leftist spaces value not being racist but have few if any people of color they know well. So they hear loud voices but don't have quiet/moderate voices to compare. Plus that thing where purity culture works best to assassinate your rivals when you do it on behalf of people who aren't there to object.
