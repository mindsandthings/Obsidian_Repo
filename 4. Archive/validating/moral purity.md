# General You

the idea of moral purity–of being born into the right opinions, of never having held conservative, negative, or just incorrect views–as a state that makes you better than everyone who did is bizarre. it’s taking a gold star approach to morality, and damning everyone who wasn’t as fortunate. it’s demanding perfection in a world that is incapable of it, and deliberately choosing to punish all attempts at correction, all desire to do better, to change, to help oneself. it’s fundamentalist christian sin incarnate: everything you do is always suspicious and tainted with your past evil _unless_ you were fortunate enough to be born in grace, and everything you do wrong will always be attributed to your inherent evil, unlike everyone else’s, who _never do wrong_ and are _led astray_ because of the evil of everyone around them.

it’s the moral and cultural equivalent of being born on third base with a silver spoon in their mouth, then claiming they hit a home run and \*earned\* everything they have with hard work and merit, and how that is so much better than all the lazy savages still toiling away in poverty.

it’s the moral parallel to being a gold star lesbian, a gold star progressive who’s never been wrong in their life, actual real life claims to being jesus.

it’s the same thought process as a transphobe who thinks that a trans woman can’t be a real woman because she wasn’t fortunate enough to be born with the right external parts or perform the correct gendered desires their entire life to prove true medical need rather than passing fetishes. it’s literally saying that a progressive who wasn’t _born a gold star_ can’t ever actually be seen as progressive because they weren’t _born that way_ and didn’t tailor their entire lives to get the proper paperwork authorization, so obviously they’re just _predatory fakes_ trying to harm the _true believers_.
