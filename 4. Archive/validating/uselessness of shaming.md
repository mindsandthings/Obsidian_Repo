So I passed by a table of anti-racist/social justice themed books today.  The old standby White Fragility was there, but also a book called Dying of Whiteness, another called Surrender, White People, and several others that had “white” in the title (where it was presented as a negative).

The books themselves are probably more nuanced than the titles make them sound (at least, one can hope), but it really strikes me how fast the framework of the conversation around racism has shifted from “we need to stop seeing blackness as a bad thing” to “we need to start seeing whiteness as a bad thing.”

Yeah. There’s a way in which whiteness is framed as a particular brand of arrogance. And I think that’s true of some people, like the straight up Nazis and their sympathizers, who keep telling themselves myths like “white people invented civilization” and believe in “western chauvinism “ and the like.

But it seems to me, as a white person who has experienced the failure mode of this where I felt just sort of… omnidirectional shame for having white privilege but not in any kind of way that helps me figure out and measure what I can do about it, much less keep track of what I’m doing right and how often, that not every white person who holds some messed up ideas about race is too arrogant.

A lot of us are actually too… humble isn’t it. We’re not actually being humble. But we’re not seeing the social power we have in the way these people are describing it. We’re thinking of ourselves as just some guy. Which is how most people think of themselves, unless they’re a little to a lot more narcissistic than the average person.

So along comes someone saying “you need to ‘surrender.’ You should be quieter. You need to take a backseat.” And while in context this makes sense—the good faith version of it is just “hey I think you missed that it’s my turn to talk now”—it’s very easy for it to seem like some universal pronouncement.

So you’re internally like. “I’m just some guy. But I’m too much of some guy! I need to be less of some guy.”

Which leads to self abasement and shaming rituals in public, but does NOT actually lead to rethinking things. Because this brand of anti racist theory is not saying “rethink things” in a neutral way, it’s intentionally trying to use shame as a tool.

But shame is a blunt instrument. You’re more likely to get self flagellants performing shame than you are to get people understanding and internalizing your point.

And then you act disgusted at their self flagellation, which confirms to them they need to do more of it, and then.

Eventually you get a spineless worm… or someone so sick of acting spineless they decide they might as well see what these Nazis are so arrogant about.

> it really strikes me how fast the framework of the conversation around racism has shifted from “we need to stop seeing blackness as a bad thing” to “we need to start seeing whiteness as a bad thing.”

I kinda had to stop for a moment here and just think that…

The “whiteness is a bad thing” has very much been a part of the conversation since the conversation started happening. It’s just hasn’t been popularized since it was typically a conversation topic among PoC, and white people weren’t really aware of or paying attention to it.

You fundamentally can’t have conversation about one without having a conversation about the other. This is point 1 of the other half of that conversation, or the context of the first sentence.

P1: Whiteness is the thing that is held as the “Good” to the “Bad” of blackness.

P2: “whiteness requires blackness to be bad

P3: “We need to stop seeing blackness as a bad thing”

C1: “We need to start seeing whiteness as a bad thing (as the first step towards what we need to do in P3).“

I think… part of the problem is the concepts mean two different things?

“Whiteness” and “blackness” can mean: a social system created and perpetuated to elevate the first thing over the second thing, and make up specious “reasons” to support this, which we spread as propaganda.

One solution to this can be “what would it look like if we saw whiteness as bad and blackness as good? Hmm, that thought experiment isn’t actually all that difficult! Doing it helps us see how the whole thing is arbitrary from go, and helps us learn to reject these categories as prescriptions for how to society.”

But.

“Whiteness” and “blackness” (or whatever) can also mean: one’s ethnic and cultural heritage. I don’t just have this visible social marker of rank (lack of melanin), I have this cultural history and identity.

And calling that “a bad thing” or “a good thing” without allowing for nuance like “your festivals and legends are awesome but your imperialist history is less awesome” can and I think does lead to people feeling shame for the wrong reasons and over the wrong things.

Which in turn leads some people to cultural appropriation, I think. “My people’s thing is shameful. Yours is good. I’m going to do yours instead.”

(As well as to weird “noble savage” oversimplifications of the culture(s) labeled good, which are less obviously bad at first glance, but also not great. Many, many cultures have been imperialist in ways it’s not great to be proud of.)

The big part of this problem (which I think you did cover in slightly different but also the same words) is that some people will understand the nuances of “white people shut up it’s our turn now” and others haven’t been educated enough to read it that way yet. So the harsher more blunt language is right and fair in many instances and far be it from me to tone police marginalised voices, but in terms of realistic productivity, fairness and justice aside, many people just aren’t educated/experienced with it enough to read between the lines and understand what actually needs to be said and done as people with white privilege.

And then there’s the problem where ‘white and black’ in terms of anti-racism teaching as listed above is an extremely Western and even more specifically American thing that doesn’t always apply well to anything outside of where it developed. For example, Australian, New Zealand and English racism problems and conversations do have overlap, but also their own variation of racism and anti-racism movements. And that’s not even beginning on things like colourism in India and the systemic oppression of the Welsh, Irish and Scottish being related but also a different ballgame again but still important when talking anti-racism, though the American model does not and cannot fit these things because it’s a different culture whose racism and the corresponding anti-racist conversations and movement sprung up around. It doesn’t apply to anywhere else in the same way it does in America.

Racism exists everywhere, but it takes on various different forms, presents varying types of systemic issues, and various types of responses to and movements against it will form based on what those forms and types of systemic issues are. 'White and black’ in American race terms becomes far less helpful again when people who are used to talking about American racism try to apply the same already-not-always-instantly-comprehendable language to racism in other places toward other demographics.

Yep. You get it.

Saying this stuff in a tone people can’t parse makes it bad as a recruitment tactic.

We really should be thinking more about that, given that the right is fucking amazing at recruitment, and part of the way they do it is saying “yeah, you’re right. The lefties are real fuckin rude.”

Honestly, I would like to say that most of racism discourse centers around “white people = bad” even though people really don’t want to admit that.

I’ve read Dying of Whiteness. It’s about how white people vote against health care because they’d rather die than let people who aren’t white get health care.

[@medleymisty](https://medleymisty.tumblr.com/) If those are their motives then whatever subset of white people they're talking about are dying of spite, not "whiteness."

Regarding the OP, I don't know the other books mentioned, but "White Fragility" is exactly as un-nuanced as the title sounds.
