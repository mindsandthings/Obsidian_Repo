# An article on memory problems during the pandemic matches well with possible memory problems due to being homeschooled. Your brain can’t distinguish between memories well if every day is the same.

It really took a global pandemic for us to get more information about this.

Holy crap, holy crap, holy crap. I thought my memory completely sucked. I can't recall things when I want to from my school years. Grades are meaningless to me and I thought it was my memory. I'm around other 40 year olds and people say "when I was in third grade blah blah blah" and I think "it's all a big blur!". But something triggering can happen and I'll remember a story with good detail.

This explains it! My kids change teachers and classrooms every year. They have an "anchor" point to attach the memory to.

My college years are more memorable. Then a big black hole in graduate school but that was sleep deprivation and mild depression.

Ah so it’s not just me! My entire childhood feels like an odd foggy memory. A therapist I was using said it’s common for people who go through trauma to block out painful memories and experience “memory loss”. I thought for the longest time that I was just forgetful.

I felt very equipped to handle the pandemic. It felt like my home schooling days. I feel like I also had more optimism about it being temporary than other people did. I didn't freak out that it might be forever. I believed there would be an end date. I guessed in March 2020 it would be by August of 2021.

I actually deepens my social connections with my friends (virtually through games and group chats and such) during the pandemic actually for this reason. I realized I was way too comfortable just hanging out in the house all day every day, talking to nobody but my immediate housemates.

Yeah my memory is shit, I can't remember most of my childhood, I definitely dissociated from the loneliness and trauma as I discovered recently. But I only really remember things like vacations. And it doesn't feel real, it feels like someone else's life.

As a psychologist who homeschools, I find this very interesting. I have never thought of this way, but it’s definitely true. Sorry for stepping in your sub, but I watch from time to time for education purposes and how I can change things for my children to make their experiences better.

That being said, it’s, in my opinion, 100% abuse of someone doesn’t allow their child multiple exposures of different stimuli. It’s essential for the human brain at any age.

I don’t really have a choice. Due to geographical concerns and limited schooling options there really isn’t much of a choice. We can attend online school with crappy internet (sometimes no internet) or homeschool. I actually teach most of the local children, some who wouldn’t have a decent education otherwise. We are in a village 60% of the year and in the city 40% of the year. Additionally, one of my homeschooled children has a severe brain injury and doesn’t perform well in school, while the other prefers to train competitively during the hours they would be in school (has a chance at the Olympics). That particular child has no interest in traditional school. The other one is PreK, so I don’t really count them yet.

I actually think a good majority of you have a right to be more than mad. Some of you had basic human rights stripped from you, and others were pure neglect. I linger for articles (or concerns) like this, that make me reconsider how we can approach homeschooling to make it a nicer experience for my children. I would hate to know my children are on this thread in 10 years talking about me, when it’s a concern I could have attempted to mitigate.

I will say that you guys have for sure changed my perspective from “parents rights to homeschool” to “child’s right to education” as well. Before this sub, I felt that parents should be able to HS regardless, but I see now why more oversight should be enacted.

I would say be careful using one kid to justify the homeschooling of your other kids. My parents used to tell me that they pulled all their kids out of school because I was being “bullied”. We lived on an island and the local schools were not good, but I think I would still have preferred a normal environment. I lived with tremendous guilt until adulthood because it felt like I was the reason my sisters didn’t have a childhood. You sound like you’re trying to homeschool for “the right” reasons, but definitely try to get your kids in an environment where they can get as much interaction with other kids as possible. My parents used to “ask” us if we wanted to go to school at different points in time, but it was a loaded question and I think we wanted to make them happy / they didn’t want to move. Kids shouldn’t really be in a position where they are asked whether or not they want to go to school because they will often speak from anxiety or say whatever parents want to hear. Local schools are rarely worse than homeschooling, but if they are very young and the local school is in a third world country, then it’s probably ok for a while until middle school when kids start learning social context and need more rigorous support.

For full disclosure- we are such a small community that we don’t even have a local school. The council has recently petitioned for us to get funding to build one- we’ll see where that goes. Our population is slowly building, so we believe the state needs to be property notified so we can get federal resources. Our literal only option is homeschooling or online schooling. That’s why I teach most of the local kids. We get together several times a week and I prepare lessons for them so they can have a basic education. I do what I can, but I’m not a certified teacher so I depend on our community coming together for resources for curriculum and supplies. We have approximately 40 kids in the village total- up from 22 5 years ago. Approximately 5 have decided to try the online route and they still come to me for help and are very frustrated.

I am sorry you carried that guilt. That is heartbreaking.

You sound thoughtful and sensitive. I’m sure you’re working hard to be a good parent. That being said, adults do have choices—and homeschooling is a choice that you’re making. I’m from the Midwest of the US, so I’m aware that our backgrounds are different. But, I’ve heard lots of parents claim they don’t have an option but to homeschool—and this isn’t the case. They choose to not take that option for reasons they feel are important; but it’s children who don’t have choices.

By all means, if you’d like to give the millions of dollars that it costs to build a good infrastructure here so we have steady access to internet go right for it. The entire community would LOVE you for it. Especially in the winter when we can’t do literally anything else.

Sigh. Sounds isolating! I think my point is that you do have a choice related to where you live: the school option in that area follows from that choice. Lots of American homeschool families move to isolated remote places and then claim they have no option but to homeschool. That is true as far as it goes, but the issue I have with my parents is that both of them were competent educated professionals and they chose to live in a place where school access and quality were poor. Fine, but it wasn’t like they were slaves who were forced outside of their will to that community—it was conscious decisions they made of free will, that were passed on to us as not having a choice. Which we as children did not.

Sounds like I may have touched a nerve.

Interesting that you’re posting in a group focused on supporting former homeschoolers and then calling me uneducated and uncultured when I express an opinion that is inline with the focus of the group, and tailored to my own lived experience. You may not see homeschooling as a choice that you are making, but my sense is that your children will when they become adults.

Also, as a side note. If you drop out of a PhD program, that doesn’t typically result in being called a psychologist. Typically we save that for people who complete the degree and pass the licensing boards.

It's all for what reason you homeschool. My parents didn't want me to learn about evolution, but couldn't afford Christian school. They didn't want me learning about sex. They did their best to get us around other homeschool kids, but we couldn't go to swim parties (immodesty) or dances (immoral, plus the music has drums).

I was 100% against homeschooling when I had kids. But my experience might have been different had I been schooled differently. The science was half dedicated to why evolution was wrong. My economics course was called "whatever happened to penny candy?" and was essentially free market libertarianism. I don't remember if it was that curriculum or another one that taught liberal politics tried to control people economically, conservatives tried to control people socially, autocracies tried to control both. Libertarians controlled neither.

I don't view the world that simplistically now, so maybe it's not as bad to teach that in homeschool high school curriculum as I remember it. Schools in my state are thinking of softening language about the horrors of slavery. So maybe this is a inherent flaw of schooling of any kind. We pass our biases on to our children.

For what it's worth, they believe it 100%. If a judge had ruled that I deserved to learn about evolution and sex education, they would have been convinced that it's the liberal world and the devil trying to corrupt my young impressionable mind.

Almost every pastor and church leader growing up was not a real believer. They were con men who could stir up fear and win respect of the congregation. But most in the congregation really believed in things like this.

I'm not sure what causes these ideas to linger. It could be a mixture of fear and paranoia (the world is against us and demons are behind every bush waiting to possess us), elitism (we know the truth and no one else does), addiction to endorphins from all of the high emotions (lots of shouting and running in a church service), desire to control others (kids and especially women), or maybe it feels nice to be the target of vast conspiracy for people who's lives are more mundane than they would like. It's exhausting to me. Maybe it's that a few con men rely on extreme emotions and mental fatigue to cause people to shut down their reasoning so they can send a 16 year old young woman to be "counseled" by a 40 year old man and not see the problem with that. Or why the pastor in this poor community owns the nicest house and cars.

I actually was at one point (sort of), but I dropped out of the PhD program when my daughter became ill and moved back to the village so that she could live a normal life and be closer to our family.

Edit: I actually ended up doing a 180 and going back to college for science and math degrees after to help this community out. No one really knew complicated science and math.

It’s very well worth looking into. It’s definitely a unique topic to bring to the table and if done properly, would get you published. It’s things like this that help transform laws and build arguments for/against homeschooling and under which provisions. As of now, there is very limited peer reviewed research.
