# Perspective in the face of other people's anger

[Perspective in the face of other people's anger](https://www.realsocialskills.org/blog/perspective-in-the-face-of-other-peoples-anger)

This is a thing that happens with some people:
* People get angry
* They tell you off in mean ways that make you feel horrible
* Or their anger scares you, even if they’re not actually being mean
* You feel like the way you’re feeling is evidence that you’ve *done* something horrible
* Or you’re afraid, and feel like you have to grovel for forgiveness in order to be safe
 
It’s really, really hard to tell whether you’ve actually done something wrong when someone is being mean to you. (Or when you’re terrified by anger or conflict.)
 
If you’re afraid or hurting, or especially both, it’s hard to have perspective. Especially if you feel like acknowledging that you’ve done a horrible thing might make that person stop hurting you. 
*Especially* if you’re really good at reading what someone wants to hear.
 
This is doubly true for people who have been abused. If you’ve been hurt by someone who demanded that you stop thinking in the face of every conflict, it’s hard to think when other people are angry with you. 
 
There are countermeasures. It’s possible to learn to deal with anger and conflict without falling apart.
 
Countermeasure #1: recognizing feelings that indicate that your perspective is off, and creating distance
* If you’re panicking and feeling inclined to make an abject apology, it’s probably time to step back
* Even if it turns out that you were in the wrong, a panic apology is unlikely to make the situation better
* Because when you’re panicking, you’re not really capable of apologizing sincerely anyway
* It’s ok to need time to think
* It’s ok to realize that you’re panicking and need to back away from the situation to be able to think
* Someone who won’t let you do this is probably not someone you should trust
 
Countermeasure #2: considering reversal:
* Think about what you did, and how the person who is angry at you is reacting
* What do you think you’d do if the situation was reversed?
* In light of that, do you think their reaction is reasonable?
* And do you think you actually did something terribly wrong?
* (The answer to this might be yes even if you think you would have reacted differently. But thinking about reversal can still make the situation easier to understand)
 
Countermeasure #3: Think in concrete terms:
* What, specifically, does the person who is mad at you think you did?
* Do you think you actually did that thing?
* If not, do they have a reasonable basis for thinking that you did that thing?
* Are they understanding correctly? Are they listening to your explanation of what you think you did? (eg: if they think you said a slur and you actually said a different word that they misheard, are they screaming at you and saying you are just making excuses?)
* If you did do the thing, why are they angry about the thing?
* Do you think it’s reasonable that they are offended?
