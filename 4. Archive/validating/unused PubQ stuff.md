# unused PubQ stuff
The stopgap measures put a lot of weight on correctly reading implicit social expectations and on just knowing the right thing to do or on being able to figure it out easily. It's difficult to distinguish the stopgap measures from measures intended to 

We hear "of course you know what you did" when we don't have any idea. There's a usually-not-explicit message of "you harm people by existing". This is exhausting and traumatizing and universal, and autistic people do a phenomenal amount of (almost always unrecognized) emotional labor trying to figure out how to do better. 

The way I've seen it work in practice is that asking questions and expressing concerns is treated as deliberate aggression. Where that's the norm (and I figured it would be based on the way the initial survey was introduced) it becomes unsafe to even say "hey, I have some concerns about the implementation". 

It turns into an endless cycle of wanting to support other people, trying to support other people, being punished for getting it wrong, being punished for trying to figure out how to get it right, withdrawing because 

I think there's an assumption that approaches like the stopgap measures will be used only as intended, to 

The actions the stopgap measures refer to aren't even clear to all neurotypical people. It's not obvious to me what "white-assumptive" means, for example. I don't assume everyone in PubQ is white, and I think it probably means something closer to what I would mean by "the stopgap measures assume neurotypicality". I tried to figure this out by web searching "white-assumptive" and "white assumptive" and got zero hits.

-- Most autistic people I know have a strong sense of justice, intense empathy, and very badly want to avoid hurting people (this is literally a common enough autistic thing that there's research on it). 

-- Autistic people extremely commonly have social trauma related to harsh punishment for unintentionally committing even minor social transgressions. Many of us have repeat experiences where trying to engage with the meta-topic - "I want to do better but I don't have information on how to do that and can't find it or even figure out how to find it" - results in all our actions being treated as intentional aggression if they weren't already being treated like that.  

In this situation, the initiative is about reducing the emotional labor required of BIPOC by having white PubQ'ers interact differently. The concerns are coming up most strongly for white autistic people because the initiative 

We're not the point of the initiative,

I have seen people cloak ableism in social justice spaces 

I'm personally reluctant at this point to talk about ableism in spaces with any social justice culture because I worry that my doing so reinforces the misconception

-- When autistic people 

-- Autistic social trauma is nearly universal. Seeking therapy for it often either doesn't help or makes it worse. Consequently, we have to manage it on our own. Often the best option is to leave a situation to prevent dumping trauma reactions on other people. Often this is interpreted as our being deliberately aggressive or noncompliant. Some of us also have secondary trauma related to being forced to stay in situations until we have meltdowns and then having those meltdowns used against us. 

-- Autistic people often need more time than neurotypical people to process social things, and more time to calm down from trauma triggers, often for reasons related to being under greater demand to handle sensory, social, and other challenges in the absence of support or understanding. 

-- The stopgap measures are partly intended to make dissent less likely to be met with defensiveness and performative flouncing, but I'm worried that they encourage performative morality (which autistic people have an especially difficult time with) at the expense of making dissent safer, and at the expense of genuine understanding (which autistic people tend to value a great deal but may need more time for). I'm also worried about what will happen if reflection *doesn't* lead me to the conclusion that I've fucked up, or if my engaging in good faith continues to make things worse. 

-- I'm also worried that the stopgap measures are representative of what the final Code of Conduct will be.
