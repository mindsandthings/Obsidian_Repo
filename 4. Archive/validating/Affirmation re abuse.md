* it breaks my heart when i see survivors of emotional abuse who were so harshly invalidated, punished and tortured for their own emotions they now don’t dare to feel, they have to ask someone else for every single feeling if it’s okay, if it’s overreacting, if it’s logical, if it’s acceptable for them to feel it, if they have a good enough reason to feel the way they do, it’s fucking devastating, to suffer abuse that makes them doubt their every emotion and makes it unsafe for them to feel it, they can’t even think about expressing it because even just feeling it makes them guilty! they’re scared of their own emotions and consider every emotion that isn’t super convenient to everyone around them to be a burden and a proof of their failure to control themselves and be a proper person
feelings aren’t illogical, they aren’t wrong, they aren’t here for no reason, they aren’t a failure of self control, they aren’t a burden, they are not an inconvenience! emotions are generated from actual things that happened, they are normal reactions to things that actually happened! if you feel scared, anxious, hurt, overwhelmed, terrified, panicked, even if it seems illogical there’s a very good reason you feel this way. you aren’t supposed to control how you feel, you aren’t supposed to doubt your emotions, they are always just a reaction, they do not come from you! they’re not your failure, feeling all this is normal and logical under unbearable circumstances of abuse and torture, feeling all these as a symptom after being exposed to trauma and abuse is normal and humane.
the only reason anyone ever told you that the way you feel is wrong is because they wanted to dismiss and deny what’s happening to you. they didn’t want you to see the truth. they didn’t want to show basic human decency to you and acknowledge that something horrible happened to you and caused this shitstorm of emotions you’re going through. it’s a part of global agenda to deny abuse and oppression is happening and forcing people to act “socially acceptable” while they’re going through torture. your feelings were right all along. your feelings don’t have to be socially acceptable. nothing about you has to be socially acceptable. you’re not impossible to handle, or too much to deal with, or a burden to others, you already spent so much energy protecting everyone from what is going on inside of you, it’s been enough of doubt, enough of guilt, it’s not you who is fucked up, it’s the world who denies validation to your reality.
