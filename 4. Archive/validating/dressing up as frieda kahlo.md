_> [W]hile it may be tempting to dressing up a child up as Coco from the Disney movie because it would be “so cute” for an Instagram post, if the child has no Mexican and/or Indigenous ancestry, that decision should be reconsidered. […]  
_

_> It’s also important to consider if you can separate the real person from the marginalized culture. Instead of dressing your child up as Frida Kahlo, assuming they do not have Mexican heritage, encourage them to dress as a non-descript painter, but then engage in a history lesson about Frida and her life before they go trick-or-treating. Considering the elements of magical realism in Frida’s work, another idea is opting for a magical creature like a butterfly or fairy as an alternative costume._

_> Other safe bets? Athletes, musicians, and public figures not directly tied to one culture or heritage._  

Huh I wonder who gets to count as “not directly tied to one culture or heritage”.

Not that I’m actually considering dressing up as Frida Kahlo, but if I did do this… it would be because I identify with her as we’re both disabled, both had major surgery, both experience(d) chronic pain as a result, and both create(d) art out of that embodied experience. Not because she’s indigenous and Mexican and my white ass thinks that’s exotic.

I do not feel nearly as intense a kinship to “some random painter,” much less a butterfly.

I get the whole “don’t treat people like fun costumes” thing but… if someone is multiply marginalized, someone with only one of those marginalizations can identify with them. Even if you personally invest more meaning in the other one(s).

I just want to reblog this again bc it’s so important to me.

I do feel like time and again I’ve been told/received the message that I can’t identify with this character too hard, can’t dream of portraying them onstage, couldn’t dress up as them for a costume party, because while I had all these reasons to love and identify with them, Race Was More Important.

And it’s a relatively recent shift - toward a more extreme version of this anyway. When I was little British kids didn’t dress up as non-spooky things for Halloween, but if we had, I was probably Disney-age right on the tail end of it being unremarkable for a little white-passing middle class girl to dress up as one of my favourite Disney princesses - Mulan and Pocahontas - and then in my teens & early twenties taught to feel horribly ashamed of having done so by Americans on the internet.

(My aunt is somewhat darker, much less Online and culturally working class, and dressed up as Pocahontas on a pub crawl last year without apparent shame or censure. I’m not going anywhere with this it’s just true I guess.)

And if I wake up the part of me that was a little kid who was really into (say) Disney-version Mulan, then she is kinda offended on behalf of her fave that people are insisting she Must be seen as Chinese above anything else she might be, like a warrior or a leader. I mean, I can’t really speak as to the mythological figure, but the emotional arc of Disney movie Mulan was all about _not_ being defined and limited by the category you were assigned to at birth!

And we don’t do this for any other category. As OP points out, we don’t even do it for race consistently. There _are_ people who’ll say a black woman can’t dress up as Superman, but we would say they’re wrong! We even think it’s cool when men dress up as women, despite a lengthy history of grotesque caricaturesque stage and sketch show performances where men portray women to make jokes at womens’ expense, which began when women were entirely excluded from appearing on the stage.

I feel like what happened is that some really fucked-up stuff happened wrt blackface and cross-race-by-white-people movie casting _in the place that got to decide what consensus social reality was for our time period,_ and we’re all just expected to unquestioningly accept _their_ weird social taboo that exists because of their specific history or we’re Bad People.

And I guess I am questioning that.
