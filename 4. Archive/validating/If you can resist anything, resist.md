# If you can resist anything, resist...

If you can resist anything, in these days where your resistance is everywhere demanded, resist this kind of damage. ...
 
[N]o one is entitled to another person’s energy, attention, or joy. Not random sea lions on the internet, nor politicians, pundits and priests. My term for people who demand my energy without my consent is spoon bandits; I’m as fond of them as I am of any brigand or pickpocket. There are people whose requests for my attention I will entertain; there are also requests that are entertaining enough that I’ll listen on those merits alone. But my energy is mine.
 
Step two, the mental and emotional. This will vary enormously by character, but at a minimum: give yourself permission to be fallible, to be weak, to be discouraged; also give yourself permission to be happy, to be at peace, to be delighted in a world that also has good things in it. ... Maintain your relationships. Seek joy, and value it when you find it. Send love to people who are struggling; it may make you feel better too.
 
Check in with yourself frequently when you’re consuming media, social or otherwise. Are you showing signs of stress and distress? Are you feeling overwhelmed? Given that, is the time you’re spending well-spent? I don’t necessarily mean “check out of current events,” though there will be people who will do that. But consider your objectives in reading your Twitter feed: is it to make you smarter? wiser? more joyful? Is your way of interacting with it doing that? Or are you just turning tharn, doing long-term damage to the emotional resources you’re going to need in the future? If so, how can you do things differently? Mute people or keywords, agree with yourself to skip political tweets and get your news from some other source, delete the app and keep up with those people by email? Whatever it is, don’t just consider it. Do it.
