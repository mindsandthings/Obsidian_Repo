# Twilight People
### Twilight People Prayer
*“As the sun sinks and the colors of the day turn, we offer a blessing for the twilight,*
*for twilight is neither day nor night, but in-between.*
*We are all twilight people. We can never be fully labeled or defined.*
*We are many identities and loves, many genders and none. We are in between roles, at the intersection of histories, or between place and place.*
*We are crisscrossed paths of memory and destination, streaks of light swirled together. We are neither day nor night.*
*We are both, neither, and all.*
*May the sacred in-between of this evening suspend our certainties, soften our judgments, and*
*widen our vision.*
*May this in-between light illuminate our way to the God who transcends all categories and definitions.*
*May the in-between people who have come to pray be lifted up into this twilight.*
*We cannot always define; we can always say a blessing.*
*Blessed are You, God of all,*
*who brings on the twilight.”*
