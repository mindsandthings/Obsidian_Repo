This is the thing about accommodation: The more accommodated I am, the less I seem like I need accommodation. If your level of activity keeps you healthy (for you), that's not an indication that you should push yourself harder, it means you've found the right balance.

Well this bears repeating: There are lots of chronically ill folx who are healthy enough to start working again, but not at all healthy enough to stay working again. If your relative health depends on a lot of rest (as mine does), then full-time work will take your health away.
