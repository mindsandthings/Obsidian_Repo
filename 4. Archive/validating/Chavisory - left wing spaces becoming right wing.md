Lately it seems like I see a whole lot of people noting (correctly!) that so many people who consider themselves leftists are actually regurgitating conservative Christian/purity culture morality…but then they’ll mostly be talking about the ways that manifests with regard to gender and sexuality and fandom content and not really touch what I consider the deeper, broader, even more alarming ways that that’s true, like:

-Inevitability or moral duty to alienate and even mistreat certain people, certain kinds of people, or certain numbers of people  

-Anti-intellectualism and devaluation of expertise

-Devaluation of mental autonomy. If you study the ~scriptures~ correctly (if you educate yourself, if you really take the time to think about it, if you read the right things) you’ll agree with us  

-Duty to disown and renounce your former self, and to internalize certain pronouncements about yourself whether or not they’re true  

-The viewpoints of people who don’t agree with us are not just wrong, they’re fake. Our way is the only way of interpreting this information.

Like for instance: [https://twitter.com/ithayla/status/1573573018608992256](https://twitter.com/ithayla/status/1573573018608992256)

He’s not wrong.

I just keep wanting someone to describe well that there is so much more to this fuckedupedness wherein lefty social justice movements are basically just co-opting evangelicalism.

I think a major sign of this problem is that free speech and logic have become right-wing-coded. How the fuck did that happen?
