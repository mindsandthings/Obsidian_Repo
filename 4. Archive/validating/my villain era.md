you say _it's my villain era_ and what you mean is that when you were six you panicked about wearing the right thing to kindergarten, what you mean is that in middle school nobody was eating, what you mean is that you spent high school _prepping for college_ and college _prepping for adulthood_ and adulthood fucking lost in the system.

what you mean is that you've been _good_. you were _a good team player._ you would have never considered yourself _perfectionist -_ those are people more popular, prettier, more successful - but you carry _any_ flaw like a secret in you, terrified someone will desert you for the simple reality of your personhood.

if you were _good_ you could be loved. you could be loved if you were selfless and thoughtful and caring. if you bent over for every person, if you went above-and-beyond, it would absolve you of who you _actually_ were. deep down, how horrible that you had _needs_. that you had _boundaries,_ that you had _desires._ you learned young that you cannot afford to cut people out of your life - you would have nothing left. it is better to live in the service of others, to supplicate. to worship. you weren't _exceptional_, you had to make up for it in some way. to prove to others you were _worthy._

if they need you, it's the same thing as loving you. if you are always-there, always-listening, always-friendly, you are filling a role. you have a purpose. you are living correctly.

_villain era,_ you repeat. you mean: yesterday you finally told a man _no_. for hours afterwards, you couldn't control your heartbeat. you mean: you've been saying positive affirmations on repeat, trying to teach yourself any new thing about how _self care is necessary._ you mean: three weeks ago, due to a scheduling conflict, you finally told a coworker that no, you couldn't do them a "quick favor". you have felt bad about that ever since. sure, it would have made you work late and it would have been extra stress - but you feel bad about it nevertheless.

you tell your therapist you have been leaning into evil. she asks what that means. when you tell her: _sometimes i prioritize my own needs,_ she doesn't find it funny. she looks at you a long time.

"and that's evil?" she clarifies.

"well," you say. "feels evil to me."
