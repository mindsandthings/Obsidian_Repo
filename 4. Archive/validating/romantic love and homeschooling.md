# romantic love and homeschooling

*  [illidanstr](http://illidanstr.tumblr.com/post/155503752892/thoughts-on-romantic-attraction-difficulty) :
thoughts on romantic attraction, difficulty getting laid, etc
first off, our society lies.  a *lot*.  it lies about how much appearance matters; both in romantic matters, in attraction, and the halo effect; you can tell this by observing people around you, your workplace, people in positions of power, history, and the stats on dating sites.  
but whether someone is attracted to someone else is very, very situational, contextual.  their feelings, tastes, how their environment affects them, how smooth someone else navigates it, how unfulfilled they are.  winning at things tends to make you a whole lot more attractive, though it can also intimidate others.  make them feel they can’t measure up, make them feel *worse*about themselves.  coaxing attraction is helping someone else feel *good*not bad, not about building yourself up like a soulless monument to your manliness, a 3d johnny bravo given flesh with the same obtuse mind. 
being totally different from those around you makes it hard to find love.  a non-verbal language barrier.  not just because you don’t know how to read them, but because you don’t know how to speak to them and they don’t know how to hear you.  and homeschooling is *really really tough*for learning many variations of non-verbal language.  religious households are often so great for learning how to read the intentions of domineering power figures to mollify them, though. 

 [there’s a certain type of honesty which is key to attraction. ](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pnas.org%2Fcontent%2F113%2F16%2FE2248.full.pdf&t=ZjNhZTcyN2RiODI3OTlhNzcyODY1YjEwZmIzYzBkNTFkYTVkNTE0YixaSVB0OTdMdw%3D%3D&b=t%3A_ENe8aSkHK9XEZwEcIkXCg&p=https%3A%2F%2Fisaacsapphire.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F155519553304%2Fillidanstr-thoughts-on-romantic-attraction&m=1&ts=1608572595) 
 [the neural mechanisms underlying individual adjustments of interpersonal attraction during social encounters might act through internal reward signals that are partly independent of external feedback](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pnas.org%2Fcontent%2F113%2F16%2FE2248.full.pdf&t=ZjNhZTcyN2RiODI3OTlhNzcyODY1YjEwZmIzYzBkNTFkYTVkNTE0YixaSVB0OTdMdw%3D%3D&b=t%3A_ENe8aSkHK9XEZwEcIkXCg&p=https%3A%2F%2Fisaacsapphire.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F155519553304%2Fillidanstr-thoughts-on-romantic-attraction&m=1&ts=1608572595) 

We found the better a participant thought they could understand another person’s emotion the more they felt attracted toward that person. Importantly, these individual changes in interpersonal attraction were predicted by activity in the participant’s reward circuit, which in turn signaled how well the participant’s “neural vocabulary” was suited to decode the other’s behavior. 


*independent of external feedback.*If you feel you can’t read someone in a certain way, if something is *wrong* it can kill attraction *even if*they’re pretty and wealthy and you want to like them.  
and if you’re different enough from those around you, if you grew up being different, you don’t know how to show yourself honestly.  you’re scared to talk openly.  you know you’re different and you suspect you’re *wrong*and you think others will reject you, turn off, you’ve been here, you know this goes badly, and there’s a certain type of partial facade which works really really super well *except* you don’t have a script for this interaction and the parser errors out on your input.  
a lot of guys who are “good with women,” in traditional binary straight culture, are, in my experience, very socially good with other men, too.  they notice when the light is shining in the window in an angle that would hit your eyes, when you feel left out, when you’re happy and enjoying something and in the moment, when you really wanted something else, how to be respectful to elders and make you feel *welcomed*and not just a guest.  how to prep logistics ahead of time so that situations go well and how to improvise when they don’t; how to calm the mood of those around them; how to reassure a sad face and how to kick a party into gear and raise up spirits for fun; how to catch themselves when they’ve lost the attention of others, how to notice when something is wrong or “up.”  a lot of these are really basic, boring, functional things; a lot of them take experience; and a lot of them take morbid levels of thought and attention regarding really freakin’ minor boring details.  helping someone feel good about themselves and have a good time isn’t just a skillset it’s a profession.
there’s so much here from *Impro*about social creativity.  speaking what comes to your mind.  letting the environment and the situations and your feelings suggest words and they just come out.  playing.  taking a role and living it.  taking a mask and being it and taking it off and being you.  being *honest*about your fears and frailty, not self-deprecating, loving yourself, but not hiding, not pretending that what everyone can see isn’t there.  cutting the latency and the checks between your instinctual reaction and the reaction you show and showing someone the truth in your feeling even when you’re terrified they’ll hate you in response. 
but these aren’t always good! there are plenty of reasons not to show your full self! not everyone is “neurotypical!” even of those who are not everyone fits in! not everyone navigates guess culture, sometimes that culture goes terribly wrong! *the way things are normally done can be full of holes and errors and trauma and leave many people out from all genders.*
a whole lot of people give up a lot for love.  they have risky sex and get STDs and partners who run off with everything they have and betray them and they *knew it was probably going to happen*and took the risk and they have sex they don’t want and take abuse just to fit in and get pregnant and get others pregnant and give in and go without and make promises and compacts with what they thought was just barely good enough that turns out to be not what they wanted at all and to find an illustration of a perfectly happy healthy relationship you need some time and goggles too.  and people’s lives often look a whole lot better from the outside.  
a lot of the PUA advice available is designed for inculcating the thoughts and habits befitting a certain role which is effective with a certain subset of the populace.  some of it is fairly universal, in terms of attraction, but by no means all.  but learning how to really do something well is about finding someone you respect, you trust, you admire, who you would want to be.  someone who wouldn’t make *you* feel gross if they tried the same thing on *you.*  *fake it until you make it only works if what you’re faking is something you are actually okay becoming.*
being confident isn’t about bravado or braggadocio.  it’s about admitting the truth - yes, you present the best side of it, you shower and use deodorant and try not to look offensive or dumb - but you show that you know who you are and you are comfortable with that person.  if you want to be someone else, you go for it, if you fuck it up, you can keep doing it, but what you can’t do is hide the truth from yourself that you just fucked it up.  you *own it*.  you own yourself, your mistakes, your feelings, your ambitions, your loves, your hates, your recriminations and your fears and your tears.
and if you’re giving dating advice the words *chemistry*and *honesty* and phrases *being yourself* and *loving yourself*and *being okay being alone*need to be unpacked all the damn way because they are not self-explanatory in the slightest.

Hahaha, look, it’s me, a nice package explaining why I’m worthless at romantic relationships and really all relationships and can’t pretend to be human outside of very scripted situations. And yeah, my parents accidentally on purpose did about 90% of that, not that they’d care or take responsibility in a million years.
I don’t suppose anyone has any solutions or treatments more effective than lead?
NOTE: ALL YOU FUCKING HOMESCHOOLING PARENTS, THINK DAMN HARD ABOUT IF THIS IS THE LIFE YOU WANT FOR YOUR HYPERACTIVE DARLING.
