[speakingwhentheworldsleeps](https://speakingwhentheworldsleeps.tumblr.com/post/190936178537/the-strange-thing-about-growing-up-in-conservative):

> The strange thing about growing up in conservative Christianity and then leaving it behind is that there are a lot of secular/progressive spaces that engage in similar thinking while sincerely believing their ideas are _counter_ to conservative ones. So I thought I would just make a list of things I was taught within conservative Christianity, the stuff that was either the _core_ of our beliefs, or the social dynamics that we created. Some of the language I use is specifically either scriptural, or Christian-speak.
> 
> This list isn’t to say “stop thinking this way.” This is actually intended to simply be informative because sometimes social justice spaces assume, “we are crafting our ideals in _opposition to_ conservative ideals therefore whatever we think surely _must be_ the opposite of whatever they think,” without ever seeming to know that their language and ideals look and sound the same.  
> 
> So, let’s begin:
> 
> **Sin-leveling**: x is bad, and y is bad, and all bad things deserve an equal reaction
> 
> **Sin-leveling part 2**: because all things are equally bad, there’s nothing wrong with inverting the consequences. Hurting others becomes acceptable (because it’s no different than doing something distasteful), doing something distasteful is unforgivable (because it’s no different than doing something harmful)
> 
> **Avoid all appearance of evil**: if I assume that your behavior looks wrong, then you are wrong, even if further context would say otherwise. You should avoid doing anything that others would see as wrong because you are not allowed the benefit of the doubt or to defend yourself.
> 
> **Sin by association**: x company contracted with y company. Y company engages in something sinful, which means x company approves of said sinful thing which means if you purchase from x company, you are condoning, supporting, and _have actually_ committed the sin.
> 
> **Think only on what is good**: or as the pastor of my old church liked to call it, “garbage in, garbage out.” Whatever ideas, thoughts, words, arguments, stories, pictures, books, movies, songs, friends, love you put in your head will _create the desire_ to become that. If you want to be good, you must avoid any bad thought because you will “slip” into _wanting_ it and then be unable to stop yourself from _being_ it. (For example, type into google “is secular music” and click on the autocomplete of “a sin”)
> 
> **Language as an in-group test**: if you do not describe your life, experiences, and beliefs with the exact same vocabulary and in-group speak, you are either not _really_ one of us, or you’re someone who hasn’t thought through their ideas as deeply as I have.
> 
> **By any means necessary**: Also known in the ex-Evangelical world as “lying for Jesus.” If my words create the necessary beliefs and actions in others, then it doesn’t matter if I am exaggerating, saying half-truths, or using manipulative language, because I’m saving others and helping them do what’s right.
> 
> **Touch not God’s anointed**: any critiques of those our community trusts, critiques of those we’ve deemed “the good ones,” are actually people trying to sow discord and disunity to destroy our community and their voice should be silenced because they must be lying.
> 
> **Judge not lest ye be judged**: A scripture that we throw at people when someone says our leadership is abusive, a scripture we cry is being taken out of context when we want to harshly critique someone ourselves. 
> 
> There’s more, lots more, but this post is already fairly long. Once again, though, this isn’t intended to be combative. I just want people to know the actual social dynamics that a lot of us grew up with in conservative Christianity communities, so they know when sometimes they’re _sharing_ those social dynamics, not _countering_ them.
