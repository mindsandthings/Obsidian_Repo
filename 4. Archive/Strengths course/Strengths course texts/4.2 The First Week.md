Once you've finished working through your packets and scheduled your one-on-one, it would be helpful to immerse yourself in your Strengths. Re-read your packets, talk to your friends or family or fellow writers about your Strengths and how they work in you. Talk about your balconies and basements. Immerse yourself in your Top Five.Â 

Look for your Top Five in your behavior. Start working on your identification of Strengths. When are you doing X Strength? Where do you see it in others? When is it most active? When is it a basement? When is it a balcony?

Identification is step one, so that's your homework. Work on identification of your Strength behaviors!
