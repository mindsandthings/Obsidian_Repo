Hello Dr. Kuntze,

Sandra Ammons suggested I contact you. I’m a hearing ASL and Deaf Studies certificate student at Ohlone. I'm hoping to find part-time research support work for later this year, and hoped you might know of opportunities for either Fremont-area or remote work.

I've previously worked as a data manager and project coordinator at UCSF on health research projects. My skills include data cleaning and basic statistics, programming online surveys, maintaining participant tracking databases, miscellaneous tech support, writing documentation, project management, training and supervising volunteers, and co-editing papers. I have a background in research psychology (M.S., focusing on cognitive development and culture acquisition) and information science (M.S.I., focusing on user experience design).

I spent the last five years focused on writing and editing, but I've realized I miss research and would like to get involved again. Ideally, I would like to work 10-20 hours per week but am open to a lower number of hours.

I've taken ASL classes for several years \[details?\], and am hoping to combine that with my interest in research.

\[include something about identity-centered communities\]

\[include specific about their research and why I think it's cool?\]

Resumes

Two-page resume is fine

Do a chronological resume, not a functional one

Turn it into a PDF

No objectives

"What makes you good? Why should a hiring manager be glad to hire you? What made you great at each job, and how did you do better than someone else would have?"

Here’s what most hiring managers want from a resume: a concise, easily scanned list of

what you’ve accomplished, organized chronologically by position, plus any particularly

notable skills. That’s it.

To better describe your job: use your real title, then include a bullet point in your accomplishments that describes the point you're trying to make.

List volunteer work if relevant.

You do not need to include very short jobs - the resume is presenting yourself in the strongest light, not a comprehensive accounting of each month of your professional life.

4\. Consider adding a Profile section at the top.

Profile sections are a totally optional trend in modern résumé writing (and have replaced the awful, old-school Objective that everyone used to have). It’s just a short list at the top of your résumé — like two to three sentences or bullet points — summing up who you are as a candidate and what differentiates you from other people with similar professional backgrounds. The idea is to provide an overall framing for your candidacy.

A good trick to writing one: Try thinking about what you’d want a contact to say if they had 20 seconds to sum you up to someone who was hiring for the work you do.

Again, though, this is optional. You can skip it if you want — and you shouldskip it if everything you come up with sounds generic. But if you can come up with something that captures how, say, a former boss who adored you might describe your work, without giving yourself over to the utterly subjective, it’s worth including.

5\. You probably don’t need a Skills section — but maybe you do.

In most fields, you don’t need a Skills section; your skills should be obvious from the accomplishments you list in your Experience section. That said, some fields are an exception to this, like I.T. or other highly technical fields.

If you do include a Skills section, limit it to hard skills, like software programs and foreign languages you’re fluent in. Don’t list subjective self-assessments like “strong written communication skills” or “visionary leader” or “works well independently and in groups.” People’s self-assessments are so often wildly inaccurate that these won’t carry any weight with employers and just take up space that would be better spent on something more compelling.

\*\*\*Leave dates of graduation off\*\*\*

Resume needs to go back only 10-15 years

"I left my position at XXXXX Corp after an accident that left me unable to fulfill my duties. After seven months of rehabilitative therapy, I recovered my lost mobility and was cleared for employment by my doctor. I am now eager for an opportunity to once again channel my talents and skills in a productive way, and am confident that I can provide tremendous value to your organization."

https://www.askamanager.org/2008/09/listing-volunteer-work-on-resume.html

I think it’s fine to lump the the volunteer work in with the paid work. As an employer, the only concern I’d have here is whether the organizations you were donating your time to were holding the bar lower/holding you less accountable since your work was free. But that’s pretty easy to address, by focusing on accomplishments in your resume, rather than just listing duties.

Cover letter

A cover letter is where you make a compelling case for yourself as a candidate. It’s where you talk

about why you’d excel in the particular job that the company is hiring for.

Ideally, a cover letter will also provide information about why you’d be a good fit for the job that

can’t also be found in your resume.

So what does it mean to customize the cover letter? Here are some ways to do it:

• Tell me why you want this particular job. What grabbed you about the job description or the

company itself? Why would you prefer this job over others out there?

• When you talk about the employer, don’t just regurgitate facts about the company that the

employer will already know. Rather, explain what appeals to you about this particular

company. For instance, mentioning your interest in working in health policy when applying for

an assistant position in a hospital portrays you as perhaps more invested in the opportunity

than the average candidate looking for any old assistant position. Remember, employers like

candidates who are excited about this particular job, not just any job.

• Tell the company why it should want you, too. And be specific.

• If something makes you especially well-suited for the job aside from your

resume, the cover letter is the place to mention it. Maybe the position

requires an inordinate degree of meticulousness and you constantly get

teased for being anal retentive about details. Great! Mention it or I won’t

know.

• If you know you’re overqualified but you don’t mind, say so in your cover

letter. Otherwise I’ll figure that you don’t understand the nature of the

position and won’t want to waste my time or yours.

• If you’re not a perfect match with the qualifications listed in the ad,

acknowledge it and tell me why you’d do a good job anyway. Don’t hope that if you don’t

mention it, I won’t notice.

• Stay away from hyperbole like “you won’t find a candidate better qualified than me.” It’s

usually not true when people say that, and it comes across as nave.

Decision relevant; I’m much more interested in answering questions where your action will change based on the answer than in justifying or science-washing a decision that’s already been made.

Involve pulling together disparate information and reading between the lines to create an understanding that isn’t publicly discoverable

Makes the information ecosystem better rather than worse. I haven’t entirely ruled out work in advertising or PR, but I’m not going to help systems that make people dumber.

If you’re interested, please email me at elizabeth@acesounderglass.com with a description of your research question. From there we can set up a call to discuss details. I typically like to start work with new clients with a well-defined, ~5 hour project. This lets us see if we’re a good fit without wasting too much time if the answer turns out to be no. If things go well, we can expand from there. Rates start at $225/hour, with some room for negotiation based on deadline and topic.

What process do you go through with clients to refine their research questions?

Can you give me some examples of typical research questions?

Psilocybin question

Thu, Apr 14, 2022

12:37 PM

I might be able to infer a ceiling on how much psilocybin could be metabolized into breastmilk over how long, and I could look for research on what concentration is too low to have noticeable-by-adults effects, but I wouldn't be able to rule out the possibility that psilocin (which is what psilocybin is metabolized into and which has similar effects to psilocybin when administered directly) or psilocin's metabolites have qualitatively different effects on developing infants than on adults. I also have not been able to find research on whether consuming psilocin's metabolites would have effects on adults (who, reasonably, are generally not into drinking the bodily fluids of recently tripping people). It's possible that someone with more knowledge of chemistry than me could figure out an answer.

I did find a 2017 review of psilocybin and psilocin metabolism (linked below) that references a 2002 study in humans finding that 3.4 +/- 0.9% of it was excreted in urine after 24 hours. I couldn't get ahold of that study through scihub, through the SF public library, or through Ohlone community college's access; I think it may not be available online. However, that appears to indicate that it's excreted very slowly in humans compared to rats (who excrete 65% in urine after about eight hours and another 15-20% in feces and bile). This review also notes that if the psilocybin is in the form of mushrooms it will be accompanied by other psychoactive compounds whose metabolism has been researched even less.

https://www.sci-hub.st/10.1080/03602532.2016.1278228

A study looking at renal clearance in humans found that psilocin's elimination half-life was three hours and that only 2% of it was intact psilocin, although some subjects took quite a bit longer. That's strikingly different from the study above. I was not able to get ahold of this paper either.

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40262-017-0540-6

If desired, I can do more research to try to reconcile the differences between these two papers, and estimate a ceiling for much psilocin and psilocin metabolites an infant would get after different waiting periods, based on subtracting the amount excreted in urine from the total amount. I could also look into research on other psychoactive compounds, if the question is about psilocybin ingested via mushrooms as opposed to synthetic.

Finally, if desired, I can look into the minimum dose of psilocybin/psilocin that causes any detectable effects for adults, and whether it's dependent on body weight, although I would not be able to answer the question of whether psilocin affects infants in the same way as adults after adjusting for body mass, or the question of whether psilocin's metabolites have any negative effects.

\*\*\*tl;dr\*\*\* With more research, I might be able to answer the question "If we were to assume that psilocybin's metabolite psilocin affects infants in the same way as adults after adjusting for body mass, and we assume that further metabolites of psilocin have no negative effects on infants, and the psilocybin is synthetic rather than shrooms, how long would a mother need to wait to breastfeed before the infant would not experience detectable effects?" But those are a lot of assumptions, and ultimately I can't give a clear answer about safety that's more useful than "definitely wait until every last bit of it is gone, and I'm not sure when that is".

https://www.microdosebros.com/psilocybin-psychedelics-and-breastfeeding-everything-you-need-to-know/

\[doesn't cite research\]

Here is what we currently know:

Psilocybin is considered the safest option while microdosing as it has the shortest half-live of common psychedelics. Within 24 hours of ingestion, the majority of psilocybin and psilocin are expected to be eliminated from the body.

Waiting until the time of five half-lives has passed before nursing reduces the presence of the substance in breastmilk and is regarded as safer, but isn’t completely risk-free either.

Some mothers report successfully microdosing while pumping to evacuate their milk supply until the time of 4 to 5 half-lives of the psychedelic has passed.

Opting for donor breast milk to eliminate all the doubts that come with microdosing, has become another option for microdosing mums, although sometimes expensive and unavailable.

Wikipedia:

The half life of psilocybin is 163 ± 64 minutes when taken orally, or 74.1 ± 19.6 minutes when injected intravenously.\[1\]

Psilocin is broken down by the enzyme monoamine oxidaseto produce several metabolitesthat can circulate in the blood plasma, including 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetaldehyde, 4-hydroxytryptophol, and 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid.\[1\]Some psilocin is not broken down by enzymes and instead forms a glucuronide; this is a biochemical mechanism animals use to eliminate toxic substances by linking them with glucuronic acid, which can then be excreted in the urine.\[79\]\[80\]Psilocin is glucuronated by the glucuronosyltransferaseenzymes UGT1A9in the liver, and by UGT1A10in the small intestine.\[81\]Based on studies using animals, about 50% of ingested psilocybin is absorbed through the stomach and intestine. Within 24 hours, about 65% of the absorbed psilocybin is excretedinto the urine, and a further 15–20% is excreted in the bileand feces. Although most of the remaining drug is eliminated in this way within 8 hours, it is still detectable in the urine after 7 days.\[82\]Clinical studies show that psilocin concentrations in the plasma of adults average about 8 µg/liter within 2 hours after ingestion of a single 15 mg oral psilocybin dose;\[83\]psychological effects occur with a blood plasma concentration of 4–6 µg/liter.\[1\]Psilocybin is about 100 times less potent than LSD on a weight per weight basis, and the physiological effects last about half as long.\[10\]:171

https://doubleblindmag.com/psychedelics-and-breastfeeding/

We know that most drugs ingested by breastfeeding mothers—including pharmaceuticals—do show up to one degree or another in breast milk, but that substances with a shorter half-life will also exit the system more quickly. We also know that the concentration of a drug in the mother’s blood plasmais related to the volume of the drug in the milk, and that the amount of a drug that enters breastmilk is related to the mother’s dose. To complicate matters further, milk composition usually varies within a single feeding; foremilk, which appears earlier in a feeding, has a higher lactose content and hindmilk, near the end of a feeding, contains more fat. Therefore, fat-soluble drugs may appear in greater concentrations in the latter part of a feeding.

Dr. James Abbey of Infant Risk, an organization that informs lactating mothers on matters around pharmaceutical drugs and breastfeeding, has written that four half-lives is “usually enough to render all but the most toxic drugs safe for breastfeeding.”Some sources recommend refraining from breastfeeding for five half-lives of the drug to reach an even greater level of safety. To maintain milk levels, breast-or-chest-feeding people can pump and dispose of breastmilk during the waiting period (a practice known as “pump and dump”).

Estimated Half-lives of Common Psychedelics

• Psilocybin – approximately 50 minutes; A 2002 study found that, based on a dose of .21 mg/kg, the majority of psilocybin and psilocin is entirely excreted from the body within 24 hoursof intake

Psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine)

https://www.sci-hub.st/10.1080/03602532.2016.1278228

n humans, psilocin is detectable in significant amounts in the plasmwithin 20-40 minutes after per os administration (Passie et al., 2002), and maximum

concentrations are reached after approximately 80-100 min (Hasler et al., 1997;

Lindenblatt et al., 1998). The effects completely disappear within about 4-6 hours

(Shulgin, 198

Psilocybin and psilocin have an elimination half-life in plasma of approximately

160 and 50 minutes, respectively (Hasler et al., 1997; Martin et al., 2013a). In vivo

studies in rats have shown that psilocin is excreted in urine (65%) and bile and feces

(15-20%) within 8 hours after oral administration (Kalberer et al., 1962). About 10-20%

remained in the organism for a longer time with metabolites of psilocin being detected

in urine 7 days after oral administration (Kalberer et al., 1962; Hofmann, 1968). About

25% of the whole dose was shown to be excreted unaltered (Kalberer et al., 1962). A

controlled study in humans showed that within 24 h, 3.4 ± 0.9% of the applied dose of

psilocybin was excreted in urine as free psilocin (Hasler et al., 2002).

https://www.sociedelic.com/a-beginners-guide-to-dosing-psilocybin-mushrooms/

Other mushroom and “truffles” species have different dosage recommendations. These dosages are for dried Psilocybe Cubensis:

• Microdose: 0.1g – 0.3g

• Low Dose: 0.25g – 1g

• Moderate Dose: 1g – 3g

• High Dose (Heroic Dose): 3g – 5g and above

https://www.sci-hub.st/10.1080/03602532.2016.1278228

brain and peripheral tissues and therefore extended effects of magic mushrooms are

likely (Fowler et al., 1996). Moreover, since psilocin may cause competitive inhibition

of MAO and this enzyme also metabolizes serotonin, brain levels of serotonin may be

elevated and simultaneously 5-HIAA may decrease (Freedman et al., 1970). It was also

described a minor oxidation metabolic pathway of psilocin to a deep blue color product

with an o-quinone or iminoquinone structure. This pathway was claimed to be catalyzed

by hydroxyindol oxidases (e.g., ceruloplasmin, the copper containing oxidase of

mammalian plasma, and cytochrome oxidase) or non-enzymatically by Fe3+ (Blaschko

and Levine, 1960; Horita and Weber, 1961a; Kovacic, 2009). Although these

metabolites may present physiological activity related to production of reactive oxygen

species during catalytic cycling, data are yet limited (Kovacic and Cooksy, 2005).

Additionally, the oxidation to the bluish products also appears when mushrooms are

handled or damaged.

The analysis of serum samples collected 5 h after mushroom intoxication showed

that up to 80% of the psilocin was present as the O-glucuronide conjugate and is

eliminated by urine in this form (Kamata et al., 2006).

What is the lowest dose with psychoactive effects? Is it by body weight?

What dose is toxic?

What substances is it broken down into?

***Where I'm at: I have the above article which talks about how it's metabolized, including up to 80% going into urine after ???. It also mentions that there are other hallucinogenic compounds in shrooms.

Moderage dose of 1 gm would mean if 80% goes into urine, 0.2 gm possibly remaining to be expressed as ??? whatever it's broken down itno. assuming that goes into breastmilk I have no idea.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/84332/

Drugs found in a woman's blood can be detected in her milk. The concentration in milk depends on the amount of drug in maternal blood, its lipid solubility and degree of ionization, whether it is actively secreted into the milk, and status of maternal renal function.

\[this is from 1972\]

https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/Profs/PUarticles/lactation.htm

Calculation of infant exposure to drugs can be used to help guide safe use

The infant's dose (Dinfant) received via milk can be calculated using the maternal plasma concentration (Cmaternal), M/PAUC ratio and the volume of milk ingested by the infant (Vinfant):

Dinfant (mg/kg/day) = Cmaternal (mg/L) x M/PAUC x Vinfant (L/kg/day)

The volume of milk ingested by infants is commonly estimated as 0.15L/kg/day. The infant dose (mg/kg) can then be expressed as a percentage of the maternal dose (mg/kg). An arbitrary cut-off of 10% has been selected as a guide to the safe use of drugs during lactation. Drugs such as lithium (infant dose as high as 80% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose) and amiodarone (infant dose up to 50%) should be avoided due to high infant exposure and potential for significant toxicity. For drugs with greater inherent toxicity such as cytotoxic agents, ergotamine, gold salts, immunosuppressives and isotretinoin, the cut-off of 10% is too high and breastfeeding is contraindicated.

Transfer of drugs into breast milk is most commonly described quantitatively using the milk to plasma (M/P) concentration ratio. The accuracy of this value is improved if it is based on the area under the concentration-time curves (AUC) of the drug in maternal milk and plasma (M/PAUC).

Infants have lower drug clearance than adults

Drug clearance in the infant is a particularly important consideration and premature infants have a severely limited ability to clear drugs. Within a few days of delivery, term infants have glomerular filtration rates approximately one-third of adult values after adjusting for difference in body surface area, and premature infants have even more impaired clearance (see Table 1). Generally, adult glomerular filtration rates (adjusted for the difference in surface area) are attained by five to six months of age. Metabolic processes such as phase 1 oxidation and phase 2 glucuronidation are also impaired in the neonate. Drugs subject to high first-pass metabolism may have higher oral availability in premature or term infants due to impaired ability to metabolise on first-pass. Adult metabolic capacity is attained towards the latter part of the infant's first year of life. The following table is useful for estimating infant clearance.
