# Paddy Ladd notes


Deafness is a process - struggle by each Deaf child, Deaffamily and Deaf adult to explain to themselves and eah other their own existence in the world

asking: what could a Deaf community become, incl if sign languag and Deaf teachers not removed in Milan? who are and were in centuries previous? how can use to inform 21st century? 

drive to answer these questions, process of becoming: Deafhood

	•	1. Introductory account of Deaf communities
	•	2. Deaf counter-narrative of Deaf history, to 1880. Introducing key terminology and ways to analyze history.
	•	3. Deaf counter-narrative of Deaf history, from 1880 to today; identify the "subaltern"
	•	4. Examines 9 disciplines, identifying theories, tools, and strategies; makes case that Deaf culture is a culture and not a subculture
	•	5. Examine what's been said about Deaf culture and identify four domains: discourse in printed media, discourse in printed media in Deaf communities, workshops conducted by Deaf subalterns and professionals, and discourses between Deaf subalterns
	•	6. Problematicizes self as a Defa researcher and outlines methodologies used in study of Deaf culture
	•	7., 8, and 9 present findings in the words of Deaf informants
	⁃	7. Identify roots and traditions of Deaf cultures in Deaf residential schools; cultural strategies developed by Deaf children to resist oralism and the positive and negative cultural features those produced 
	⁃	8. Identify roots and traditions of Deaf cultures in Deaf clubs: the power structure in Deaf clubs, role of (mainly hearing) Missioner to the Deaf, and identifies two polraized positions taken by Deaf club members.
	⁃	 9. Deaf club members who rebelled against "mission control" and gives examples of young school-leavers seeeking out Deaf elders. The pub as the site around which Deaf rebellion coalesced, how lay hearing people informed Deafhood, then illustrates constrasting interpretations of Deafhood held by the rebels and those who remained in the club. Then, British Deaf Association and post-war contestation between deafness narrative and varying Deafhood readings. Shows Deafness is a culture.
	•	10. Draws threads together; describes implications of cultural recognition
	•	11. News and discoveries since 1996. Contemoprary battle for recognition of sign languages as official minority languages. 


Says this is the first of three texts and a DVD. Did those happen? 

Other central concepts for the Deaf Cultural Projec
	•	Deafhood. Compares to blindness: glasses-wearers are not blind and hard-of-hearing people are distinct from the Deaf signing community. This narrative proposes that conflating Deaf and HoH were a deliberate tactic for suppressing sign languages in Deaf ed.
	•	Culturo-linguistic model: Deaf communities swept along with DA social movement because lacked power to make their own views known. Got some limited benefits, but it compromised their ability to express their reservations. Issue is that social model uses the medical concept (deafness) for deciding who should be included in ranks. Social model helps for individual hearing impairment but those are not specific to Deaf communities. But Deaf is more in common with language minorities. And are collectivistic, not individualistic. Poor education of Deaf children damages community—it is a double oppression similar to that of indigeneous, enslave, and colonized peoples. So Deaf communities' priority not accessibility but for Deaf children to received Deaf-centered education in own language. 
	•	Colonialism. (linguistic colonialism) Tropes of charity and benevolence: welfare colonialism (orig about Austrailan Aborigines)
	•	Deaf epistemologies: if it's a culture that means it has epistemologies (ways of viewing the world). Post-modernism: he doesn't like because it's an external attempt to impose meaning - intersection of age, class, race and gender interferes with minorities' attempts to locate groups of features which their members hold in common. 

[p28 holocaust comparison] 

p34 advent of hearing aids used to mainstream more deaf pupils from 1960s onward.
Ladd advocates for bilinguality/biculturality (p34-45)
argues that both medical and social models are inadequate; the social model doesn't recognize that
