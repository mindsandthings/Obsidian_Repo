• What is a local government?

⁃ Solely creation of state government - chartered by state to implement state policies and govern at the local level

⁃ Consequently, they have significant limits to thier power. Dillon Rule / Dillon's Rule: local governments can only do what they're expressly allowed to do by the state in either laws or the state constitution. Most states have "home rule" provisions to loosen Dillon restrictions, but many still require "enabling" legislation from state legislature or apply only to specific types or sizes of government.

• Types of local government

⁃ General-purpose: basic stuff - collect taxes, provide services, handle law enforcement, infrastructure, and roads, etc.

⁃ Counties: arose out of pre-existing unofficial borders. Main purpose is to implement state policies at the local level. Especially true for the legal system (e.g. state courts, prosecutors, judges, jails - circuit/district courts). However, thanks to increased capacity they also offer services (police, fire, EMS), programs (parks and rec incl youth summar camps and sports programs), building inspectors, libraries, health and social service departments, registrar offices that run all elections.

⁃ Municipalities: most are cities. Problems of inequality (centers of power/welath/culture, cnocentrations of poverty/segregation).

⁃ Oddballs: some places treat towns as distinct from county borders. Also, NYC. In some places cities and counties have been merged (Philadelphia). Native American reservations. Territories with their own local government structures; Washington, DC; unincorporated areas.

⁃ Single-purpose

⁃ School districts: financing is prominent issue even when not key. Most states use equalization formula to try to make up for gap in property tax revenue between rich and poor districts.

⁃ Special districts: e.g., problems that extend beyond one local government's border (river that floods 3 different counties), or a technical need that a city or county decides would be better served by an expert governing body (providing electric service, promoting economic development, soil and water conservations). These are often overlooked by citizens and most often run by appointed boards, which means they often lack accountability and can operate in wasteful/irresponsible ways.

• Local government structure:

⁃ Most general-purpose local governments have a mayor-council government (since most don't have a mayor, better term may be executive-council government). Legislative makes laws, executive administers/enforces them. i.e. board or council passes laws.

⁃ Weak-mayor system: mayor typically selected by council from within its ranks, and mostly runs council meetings and holds some ceremonial power. Council operates both as a legislature and an executive (passes laws, is in charge of day-to-day operations of government especially through appointing key department heads like head of public works or police chief). Counties more likely to follow weak-mayor. School boards too.

⁃ Strong-mayor systems: executive elected separately from council. TYpical can directly appoint heads of branch departments. Larger cities tend to favor strong-mayor structures. May call them county executive, mayor, "county judge".

⁃ Either strong or weak can be combine with a council-maanger form of govt. Whoever's in charge of teh exec branch appoints mgr to run govt operations.

⁃ Legislative branches can have many different names (council, commission / board of commissioners, board of supervisors, and weirder ones)

⁃ There are plenty of exceptions to strong/weak-mayor system, like votors electing representatinves to departments directly.

• Local government vocabulary

⁃ Ordinance: law passed by municipality or county

⁃ Code: individual laws complied into "code of ordinances"

⁃ Resolution: statement of opinion without force of law. When issued by mayor or exec branch typically called proclamations.

⁃ Zoning

• Several notable officials in different local govts. Prominent ones include:

⁃ Clerk: chief administrator for a local govt. Knows how to use computer and find files. May sometimes be appointed or even elected and responsible for a range of things like maintain code of ordinance and issue marraige licenses

⁃ Registrar: responsible for administering elections.

⁃ Sheriff: variety of responsibilities and functions (e.g. in CA is chief of a county's police force)

⁃ Treasurer (tax collector) issues tax bills and ensures local taxes are filed and pai deach year.

⁃ Assessor: most locailities funded by property taxes, has important role of determining value of property within city/county limits

⁃ Auditor, Inspector General: may have either or both or combined duties into one office. Review finances of city and county depts to ensure $ is properly spent. IG offices look for fraud and criminal activity.

• Many positions elected. Can lead to long ballot with uninformed voters. For most good government advocates specific functions better served by appointed officials than ambitious politicians, esp local judges.

• Advocate for home rule in your state: the more local control the better.

• different associations for many types of local government

Why important:

• Local governments doing more (increased capacity). Republicans have dismantled federal bureaucracies and returned power to state na dlocal level, eg welfare policy and healthcare delivery. State and local governments more responsive to public opinion when federal slown to change e.g. marijuana.

• Local governments using new technology to do more, and as a result cities, counties, and states are communicating and working together more often.

• "Policy diffusion": new laws spreading across regions of the country.

• Still/more, at odds with each other over issues like natural resources and economic development, and in conflict with state governments over Dillon Rule restrictions and sometimes the fed govt (e.g. school districts - no child left behind, common core)

• Expenditures for state and local governments have tripled since the 1970s, straining local revenues especially property taxes. They can't freely borrow; they must balance their budget every year.

• Local governments are all about land use: zoning, housing, etc. Services (garbage, libraries, parks, health clinics, homeless shelters, etc). Taxes: mainly property taxes though some tax admissions, meals, cigarettes, gas, other economic activity. Public education. Social issues (abortion clinic regulations, anti-discrimination laws, sanctuary city resolutions).

• Why is participation low? Lack of media coverage due to decline of local newspapers. Internet resources don't always gain tractoin. Leads to news deserts.

• You want access and impact. Access means you can get into rooms; impact means you have a chance of affecting outcome of laws and regulations. It's where you get the most bang for your buck. Local council or board meetings monthly or more, most require foficial public comment periods. You can catch them in public or make an appt whenever they have public office hours. You can even run for office - in many places the barrier to entry is extremely low. Small staff let you get to know the clerk etc, who is often the most plugged into the political scene and the most knowledgeable about how to get things done.

Housing:

\-\- dedicated funding stream: housing trust funds typically funded by real estate transfer taxes

\-\- community land bacnk: granted ownership of troublesome properties local developers afraid to touch. engage with local community needs like adding a grocery store in a food desert. community land trust: nonprofit owns property and decisions abou development made by community board.

\-\- community benefit agreements: developers promise to maintain wage floors and affordable housing targets in exchange for community support for development projects. govts can make these types of arrangements easier or harder through legislation, regulation, and political support

Public transit:

\- Advocacy and watchdog groups

\- Bus Rapid Transit

\- More frequency often translates into less coverage; we need both
