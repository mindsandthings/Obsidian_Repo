rolls in a week later with another suggestion. Comfy Sleepy and Signa also know this system & they're in Nest if anyone wants to go in there to vibecheck them, but.

Their name is Mariage SorciÃ¨re. They're the system with Umineko sourcemates (and another Battler, hence Tora going by Tora), if we've ever mentioned them in passing. They don't have any openly plural public-facing social media, I think.

passing thought but we rlly like pekoe, Mycelium Forest, and Quantum Realm over on PN & they might bring some cool insights if we start looking into expanding again
