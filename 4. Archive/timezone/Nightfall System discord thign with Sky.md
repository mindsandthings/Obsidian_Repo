# Unsent notes



I don't think it will go like you're expecting, for multiple reasonsâ€”for example, I remember Dark Blue getting kicked from the LGBT server a year ago and how upsetting it was for them, and I also remember NFS specifically saying they would really like to be invited to this server, even though they were barely active in the old server at the time. More to the point, I think it would demonstrate very clearly that mods don't consider themselves to be bound by server rules or by the need to consider likelihood of harm, and that instead we get to do whatever we like based on our own personal comfort (so other members better be careful what they do here, or in any other part of their own lives including their romantic relationships). 

Here's the thing, though: I can't think of *any* way to handle this situation that goes well. I don't want to bring the discussion to the members because it'll be upsetting for everyone to be forced into essentially putting a server member on public trial. I'm not going to quietly kick Nightfall and hope no one asks publicly, because that would be both unethical and a bigger violation of trust. 

I don't want to continue as things are, because I don't want to mod with you anymore. So I am offering to transfer server ownership to you. I will resign from being a mod, make a brief and nonspecific announcement, and then I will no longer be able to prevent you from banning people for any reason. Anything that you do after that is solely your own responsibility. Let me know if you are ok with this and I will 


# Draft to send

Two systems have recently asked to exclude another system from part or all of the server (a different system each time, in unconnected events). In both cases, it was an issue of personal comfort: there was no server rule violation and also no concern of harm to/misbehavior. 

When moderators revoke access based on individual members' discomfort, you wind up with a space where everyone's inclusion is precarious and dependent on their ability to curry more favor with the mods than whoever might dislike them. 

We have rules discussed and agreed on by the community in part so that doesn't happen. Since there was no server rule violation or concern about actual or potential harm/misbehavior, I have not honored either request and don't plan to honor similar requests in the future. (If there had been concerns about harm/misbehavior but no rule violation, then depending on circumstances it might have merited a warning/suspension and a discussion of potential rule changes, but that was not what happened here.)

Not wanting to be around people you're uncomfortable with is common and understandable. You don't have to be friends with everyone in a server and you don't have to feel a particular way about anyone in the server, but you can't curate their participation, only your own.

Re my post in #announcements: I'm trying to get some other things done and not feeling great. I'm not likely to participate much in any discussion, and my replies may be delayed. 

heavily in any discussion of this but other folks are welcome to discuss it, and to propose changes; see rule 10 in #rules, as well as rule 2.
