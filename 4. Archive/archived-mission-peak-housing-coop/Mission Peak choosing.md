# MEMBERSHIP


### There are three levels of involvement in Mission Peak Cohousing
 
 
At all three levels, you are encouraged to join one or more committees to share in the work of creating our community.
 
### ~Provisional/Prospective Members~

You may attend 3-4 of our events or meetings to assess whether Mission Peak Cohousing might be a good fit for you. You are provisional/prospective members until you are ready to make a decision and/or investment.
* Become educated about cohousing and about Mission Peak Cohousing in particular.

* Become active with the community and participate in committee and community meetings.

 
After attending four times, you begin paying the $25 monthly dues but do not yet participate in making group decisions.
 
### ~Associate Membership~

If you and current members agree about continuing the process to the next step, you will be encouraged to become an associate member and complete a personal profile so the community can get to know you better.
* Agree to acquire a thorough understanding of cohousing principles.

* Participate in at least 50% of our community meetings, participate on at least one committee and attend at least one community-building activity (such as meals, parties, mixers) per quarter.

* Gain the standing to participate in non-property- related decisions.

 
Associate members pay a $250 associate member initiation fee and the $25 monthly dues.

### ~Full Membership~

The final step is to become a full member of our community and its limited liability corporation (LLC). Once again, if you and current members agree about continuing the process, you will become one of the households that commits to the creation of the Mission Peak Cohousing community and supports its vision and values.
* Register as a member of the Mission Peak Village LLC

Full members pay an initiation fee of $500 and $25 monthly dues.
 
You will need to be able to financially afford participation in the project and make regular capital contributions until you have invested at least 5% of the estimated cost of your home type. When you become a full member of the LLC, you agree to pay all financial contributions required to date (the amount contributed by others). You can withdraw at any time, but you agree that any payments made beyond the initiation fee and monthly dues will be refunded after all homes are sold and constructed if there are sufficient funds available.
