We hope you enjoy using Scrivener. The registration details above allow you to unlock the trial version of Scrivener so that it becomes the full version.
To start using the full version of Scrivener, follow these instructions:
*INSTALLING*
Scrivener is download-only, so if you have not done so already, you will need to download and install the trial version:
1) Download the trial version from:
 [http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php?platform=mac) 
2) Install the trial version by double-clicking on Scrivener.dmg and then dragging the black-and-white Scrivener icon from the window that appears and dropping it into your Applications folder in the Finder.
3) Eject the Scrivener.dmg disk image in the Finder and launch Scrivener from the Applications folder. If you wish to add Scrivener to your Dock, drag it from your Applications folder to the Dock (do not drag it directly from the install window to the Dock).
*ENTERING YOUR REGISTRATION INFORMATION*
When the trial launches and you get to the nag box that tells you how much of the trial period you have remaining, click on the "Enter License..." button and enter the user name and serial number /exactly/ as they appear above. (Note that the serial number is tied to the user name, so it is a good idea to copy and paste both, being careful not to copy any extra blank spaces at the end of the serial number.) Alternatively, while running Scrivener, you can select "Registration..." from the Scrivener menu. Entering your licence information into the trial version turns it into the full version (that is, removes the time limit).
*GETTING UP AND RUNNING*
We strongly recommend that you go through the interactive tutorial project (available from the Help menu inside Scrivener) to get up and running and learn Scrivener's major features before starting your own projects.
For further assistance, we have a number of tutorial screencasts available on our videos page:

This order confirmation contains both your receipt and registration details, so please be sure to save this information and keep it somewhere safe. (Please note that because we are a small shareware company, we are unable to provide printed receipts via the post.)
Happy writing!
