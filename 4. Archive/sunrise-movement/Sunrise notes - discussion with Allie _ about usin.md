# Sunrise notes - discussion with Allie ? about using for Earth Day
### action network map, 2x/day pause and point to local live streams
### local could be on a bunch of different platforms and they'll run a live stream

### how to make those more accessible

### they have funds for cc

### some variety of people talking: panels, interviews, teach-ins
### a lot through zoom in some way, might be streamed into something else
### dance pieces

### supplementary materials? maybe some presentations

### 100 registered local livestreams, maybe 200
