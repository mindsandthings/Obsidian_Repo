Necromancer

I can’t take full credit for all of this—it came together as the result of conversations with many different redditors—but here is my unifying theory of everything Nona! (Sorry for the length, it’s a lot…)

1.  Harrow broke into The Locked Tomb when she was 9, kissed Alecto on the mouth, and absorbed a little piece of Alecto’s soul via a piece of her frozen lip that stuck to Harrow’s lip. Nona/Alecto explains this shortly before the epilogue in NtN.
    
2.  Harrow had episodes as a child where this scrap of Alecto—the Body—would take control of her, presumably in the year between her opening the tomb and Gideon catching her entering it. Crux tells us this at the end of NtN, when he says Harrow has “gone away again” and urges her to “come back.” After her parents' suicides, Harrow never sees the Body again when she's awake—presumably she somehow locked The Body/Alecto away in her mind, in a place that looks like The Locked Tomb. She does not seem to remember how/why the Body disappeared. This incident may be why Ianthe sees some scarring in Harrow’s brain during the lobotomy.
    
3.  When Gideon and Harrow complete the Lyctor ritual, Harrow begins to digest part of Gideon’s soul (we’ll say she gets down 25% of it).
    
4.  She later gives herself a lobotomy to forget Gideon, with Ianthe’s help. During this process, they have to open the Locked Tomb “box” in Harrow's mind to stuff Gideon into it, and the Body escapes. This is why she seems to have reappeared after many years—as mentioned above, Harrow had unwittingly (?) locked her up somehow.
    
5.  The Body actually absorbs the 25% of Gideon that Harrow ate. This is why the Body’s eye color changes from black (in Harrow’s childhood memories) to gold (after the lobotomy). The first thing the Body says to her in HtN is also "What he is saying is that you have to learn that sword," which is a very Gideon thing to say. So the Body in HtN, which later becomes Nona, is actually a scrap of Gideon and a scrap of Alecto. (There are many clues in NtN that Nona does have some Gideon in her. In the scene where she wields the piece of chair like a two-hander, Nona even says she’s screaming through "the mask that was front of her face” or something like that, i.e. Harrow's face is a mask for Alecto, and also, Gideon's face in the pool dream had skull paint. At one point she also seems to try to hold Gideon down under the water in her dream and can’t, so Gideon’s soul is fighting her, I think?).
    
6.  Speculation: It’s possible that The Body+Gideon25% let the 75%Gideon out of the mind prison near the end of HtN because she/they needed Gideon’s fighting skills to save Harrow’s body.
    
7.  At the end of HtN, Harrow ends up back in her own mind, in the place where she had imprisoned the Body, and more recently, where Gideon was imprisoned, hence the presence of her sword and the fake titty mag. When the text says this is the “final resting place of Harrowhark’s one true love,” it’s ambiguous whether it’s referring to the Body or Gideon, or… both? (Edit: There is a lot of debate about exactly where the version of The Locked Tomb that Harrow fell asleep in was located. There is a moment near the end of NtN where Nona finally comes face to face with her own "real" body—Alecto's body—and the text says, "But there she was—and within her, the child, asleep, with the strange sword." This makes it sound like Harrow has been in Alecto's mind inside the literal tomb this whole time, but I don't think that's the case. Nona is severely disassociating at this point—Nona is Alecto, Alecto is Nona, Nona doesn't know where she ends and Alecto begins—so I think Nona is now seeing herself and Alecto as the same thing. Harrow has also experienced similar disassociation for much of her life and has an episode in HtN: "If Ianthe reached out to touch your arm, you were afraid you might not understand whose arm she was touching.")
    
8.  In this mental prison in her own mind, Harrow “fell asleep, or dropped dead, or both.” Her body dies temporarily, but Harrow's soul is in her own mind in the Locked Tomb mind prison, asleep and dreaming Alecto’s memories of her early life with John on post-necro-apocalypse Earth. This is what the text means by “faraway in a land she had never traveled.” This "dream" is what we see in the John chapters in NtN.
    
9.  When Harrow’s body dies, The Body comes for the 75% of Gideon that’s been controlling Harrow and kicks her out, or she just gets booted out automatically because she's not the original occupant (the “no no no” that Nona is named for is likely unconscious Gideon prior to this happening, because CamPal is already working on Harrow's body when Gideon says she "dies").
    
10.  Finding herself seemingly the lone occupant of a human body, The Body takes a cue from Harrow's lobotomy and tries to partition off her memories so that she can experience a human life in a human body (or mostly human, Harrow being a Lyctor, after all).
    
11.  So Nona is a scrap of Gideon + a scrap of Alecto, and Harrow is asleep and dreaming in a corner of her own mind for most of NtN. There are three layers in Nona’s consciousness, and Nona says that the top and bottom layers know what the tower is, so probably not Harrow and definitely not Gideon (who is part of the middle "Nona" layer anyway). I think the top and bottom layers are Alecto with her memories intact (some of which Harrow is experiencing through her dream), and ??? Maybe John, as weird as that sounds, because there is supposedly a piece of him in Alecto, and he would know what the tower is.
    
12.  This one was not my idea, but it does make some sense. When Nona kisses Gideon’s revenant corpse in NtN, she is able to either transfer that 25% of Gideon back to her, or start a transfer process that is maintained by their proximity for the remainder of the story. So throughout the back end of the novel, Gideon’s soul is slowly knitting itself back together, which could be why Gideon seems to become more and more “herself” as the story progresses. Edit: I'm fairly certain that Harrow kissing Alecto when she entered the tomb as a child is new information. This means that there is a parallel between Nona kissing Gideon and Harrow kissing Alecto, but we don't know that until the end of the book, so that kiss really could be more important to the plot than it seemed... Muir loves to plant clues that don't seem obvious until you get certain pieces of info later!
    
13.  At the end of NtN, Nona returns to Alecto, Harrow “wakes up” and regains control of her body (but may not be a Lyctor anymore?), and unbeknownst to all, Gideon’s soul is already whole or getting there (maybe?).
    

There are a few things I still have questions about, and I'm very unsure about the 25% of Gideon's soul that Harrow "ate," but this all holds together pretty well for me.
