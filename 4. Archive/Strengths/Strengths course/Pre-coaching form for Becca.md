I discussed three major topics with Susan for my 1-5 strengths, and she suggested following up on the same issues from the full 1-10 strength perspective. 

I'd also be interested in your thoughts on strengths changes over time. I'm aware changes are partly an artifact of learning more about strengths, but I think Analytical and Deliberative (top 10 only in 2022) are major features of the way I interact with the world now (and Susan commented on Analytical being present in a lot of what I said as well). When strengths rise in prominence, is that more likely to represent a growth area to leverage or an attempt to work around a blockage in some other more "natural" strength? When strengths drop in prominence, does that mean they're being neglected, or that they're less useful? etc. 

The topics I discussed with Susan: 

-- Info management for fiction: I write slowly and have a poor memory. I need to create an information tracking system that actively supports my ability to identify dependencies in worldbuilding, plot, and character arc for a given book—including tracking what's on the page, tracking the underlying generative information that gives rise to what's on the page, and tracking how fixed or flexible that information is based on how many problems I'll create by changing it. 

Susan coached me on this for my 1-5 strengths. We came up with: reverse-outline and update my list of plot threads immediately on finishing a scene (instead of waiting to finish the draft), and try to figure out waterfall changes for other scenes at that time. Neither of us had ideas for how to represent dependencies to facilitate identifying what problems changing a piece of info will cause. 

-- Nonfiction writing: Once I know too much about a topic, I can't write about it anymore because I can't find simple, linear paths through the information. Each concept lights up at least five associated concepts and each factual statement has multiple caveats. Editing this into something bite-sized and manageable takes so much time and frustration that it's no longer worth it to write. When choosing whether to simplify, I can see probable real-world harm done by simplifying information to make it more easily conveyable, which adds a layer of difficulty. 

Susan recommended reading and analyzing examples of others' nonfiction. We also talked about the responsibility of editors and the importance of finding a trustworthy editor, which would not help much for my primary topic but could help for less charged topics. 

-- Finding writing advice focused on using strengths to write stronger, more enjoyable backstory/worldbuilding/exposition, as opposed to writing advice focused on keeping it as barebones as possible. 

We talked about this mostly in relation to Input. My plan is to make a list of authors whose works do things I like and look for whether they have patreons/substacks/etc with useful advice. 

***Summary of above***:
1. Implications for strengths development of changes in strengths over time
2. Information management in fiction: how to better anticipate the effects of changing a detail on other parts of the book (possibly by representing dependencies)
3. Nonfiction writing: when I know a topic too well I can't write short pieces about it anymore
4. Finding strengths-compatible writing advice for enhancing backstory/worldbuilding/exposition 

(I know we might not be able to get to all of these)
