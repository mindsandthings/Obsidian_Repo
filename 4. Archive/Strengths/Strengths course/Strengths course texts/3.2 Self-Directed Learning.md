This class is primarily made up of one-on-ones and self-directed learning. I want to give you the time to let this information sink in. Make sure you read and think if you need to, and give yourself the time to process.

Self-directed learning primarily means that we won't be having classroom discussions. But after you have been through your first one-on-one, you will be added to the ongoing Strengths Communities (forums on my website) that are private and open only to people who have that Strength in their Top Five. After your second one-on-one, you will be added to the Strengths Communities for the next five Strengths.

These communities will be ongoing, and you'll have an opportunity to chat with other writers who have a particular Strength. These communities are self-moderated, and there are behavior guidelines, but mostly, I want to leave them open so you can learn from each other. The best teachers are often other people who are also strong in your areas.
