Critique methods 

We 

Some of the worst critique fails I've seen happen when a critiquer completely misses what a writer was trying to do with a piece. For example, the writer is attempting Thing X but the critiquer assumes they're attempting Thing Y and their critique singles out the Thing X bits as detracting from a successful Thing Y, which usually isn't helpful feedback. It can hit writers harder when Thing X is also related to a marginalized identity they have, but it's often not helpful even outside of that. 

I think we underuse the opportunities we have for using critique explicitly as a means of helping writers realize their goals, because the writer often only has an opportunity to share their goals, especially their goals for an individual piece, after the critique is over. Goals for a piece can be quite personal and no one should be required to share them but I think we could get a lot of mileage out of normalizing talking about what you're trying to do with a piece as an option (and doing it before people put their critiques together, or at least soon enough that they have time to adjust their critiques). A venue like Clarion West is especially good for this because we have ongoing critiquing relationships and also live together, so it's easier to develop a high degree of trust. 

2) Somewhat related: critiquing relationships are relationships and I think there are some parallels with, for example, romantic relationships in that good tools for explicitly discussing and trouble-shooting the relationship are important. There might be ways to work more of that into discussions around critiquing at the workshop. (Especially because we're likely to wind up in critique groups or with critique partners after Clarion West, if we don't already have them.)

3) A separate point: I think it would also help to encourage writers and critiquers to talk about audiences plural (and intended audiences), and readers plural, instead of "the audience" and "the reader". And also to encourage critiquers to keep in mind that even just being a writer means they differ in a significant way from most readers of published works.

I think there's, like, an implicit model where the instructor can see the true form of a story and the author's goals are irrelevant

What has been the most fulfilling part of working with Clarion West? Feel free to share highlight moments or stories.
Seeing the current FAQ go up on the site! After attending CW, I wrote a blog post to help other disabled writers decide whether to attend Clarion West. The CW staff and board recognized that the nuts-and-bolts descriptions of daily life would be helpful to prospective applicants and prospective attendees and hired me to help them revise the current FAQ to include those descriptions. 

What has been the most challenging part of working with Clarion West?
There were some delays in turnaround on the FAQ. I don't feel like this was challenging, exactly? I just waited until they could get back to me. It's the only thing I can think of to put here though. 


What is the best writing class or workshop you have ever taken, or the last experience that encouraged you to create “wild and amazing worlds,” and what lessons could Clarion West apply from it?
I'll put thoughts on this in the alumni section. (Edit: this question wasn't asked of alums, so I'll wait and answer if it comes up in a relevant way in the future)

Is there anything else you think Clarion West could improve to help writers be successful today? 
I'll put thoughts on this in the alumni section. (Edit: this question wasn't asked of alums, so I'll wait and answer if it comes up in a relevant way in the future)

How often did you feel safe and supported to share your insight, ideas, and feedback as a LGBTQIA+ staff member, board member, instructor, or alum of Clarion West? (If you aren’t LGBTQIA+, please skip this question).



Neurodivergence
I think this is a question about general experience and not about critiques per se so I'll keep my reply general. 


On almost all occasions I felt completely safe and supported. 

We had an issue my year where an instructor critiqued a piece with a queer character in a way that multiple class members found offensive. The instructor's initial critique was that another character had not responded realistically negatively to the queer character being outed, and suggested a violent response instead. 

I believe the instructor felt that we didn't understand the severity of discrimination against marginalized groups, including the students from marginalized groups who explained why they didn't necessarily want to tell stories that included violent discrimination even when realistic, which not all of us felt it would have been. 

After students objected, the instructor gave examples of violent incidents to persuade us that we still didn't understand, including an increasingly graphic description of crowd violence against a Black man (the instructor was white and to my knowledge not queer). Several class members walked out at that point, including myself. 

Afterward the staff and the class met with the instructor not present. A big chunk of discussion focused on whether it had been inappropriate for us to walk out. Staff felt it had been; students were split, with queer people and people of color on both sides. It was a painful and unpleasant experience. 

Staff felt the conflict was partly due to the piece being memoir rather than fiction (a number of the students had known it was ahead of time, but the instructor had not), partly due to a culture clash due to our class being unusually accepting and supportive, and partly attributable to hearing impairment on the part of the instructor (the students weren't previously aware of this; I don't know whether staff were).

There are a lot of issues going on in here and this is way too long already but:

 - A lot of it could have been avoided if students had had more in-the-moment choices accessible to us than continue to disagree ineffectively, sit and listen to something that was being handled so badly by the instructor that we couldn't remain in the classroom, or walk out. I don't know what the best way to do this is. (Maybe something's already been put in place, I don't know.)

 - There were multiple culture clashes going on, including ones that led to different beliefs about what's realistic, opinions about when and how speculative fiction should be realistic, opinions about what goals for representation should be prioritized and why, implicit disagreements over the the risk and harm of potential erasure vs inserting violence unnecessarily, and implicit disagreement over whether someone who isn't in a marginalized group ought to be listened to more than people who are. All of those with the exception of the last one are (at least in some formulation) things people can legitimately disagree about, and discussing them can actually lead to people thinking more deeply about writing. I wish we'd had a way to shift the discussion onto those topics instead. 

 - There are complicated issues going on with critiques and author disclosure of nonvisible identities that I'm not even going to try to address here.

 - If disability interferes with someone's ability to teach effectively it needs to be addressed proactively.

I apologize for this being so long. I wrestled with how to make it shorter, but couldn't figure out how to omit details without misrepresenting the perspective of someone involved or making the bullet points above seem like non sequiturs.

My understanding is that the committee is going focus on the critiquing method, so I'll answer primarily about that. The current critiquing method had a number of features that made it accessible to me: 
-- Enough time to manage any processing issues: pieces available for reading enough ahead of time that I could read them multiple times, think carefully, and write out a critique
-- Minimal demands for on-the-spot spontaneous verbal responses: I could read from my written critique and could pass if I needed to.
-- Auditory attention demands not nearly as bad as they could have been: each critique went on for no more than a few minutes before shifting to the next speaker.
-- Auditory information supplemented with text: I usually got oral critiques of my work supplemented in written form enough of the time that if I missed some things in class, I still got what I needed.
-- Down time available after class to help recover. 

The week the instructor elected to deviate from that format and go full auditory (which I think was the first week?) was pretty terrible for me—I was still too out of it from traveling and too floored by the instructor's decision to turn written submissions into auditory format by reading them aloud himself that I couldn't manage to advocate for myself or even figure out how to. Luckily, I don't think he had us critique them (I actually can't remember most of that week). 

Related to the incident I described in my answer to the queerness question: in the meeting afterward between staff and the class, students were asked to remain in the room until we'd worked things out. People were very emotional and the class was divided. I'd been asked not to leave and felt I couldn't leave to self-regulate. I was not able to handle it and had a public meltdown in class, which was a deeply shameful experience for me and I sincerely doubt was a great experience for the class either. I'm grateful that no one seemed to hold it against me later on. I think there are probably ways to handle contentious issues that still allow people to leave to self-regulate if needed.

It was exhausting but overall manageable. I wouldn't have applied or decided to attend if I'd thought it wouldn't be, though. I did wish I'd had more information available to help me make the decision (which is why I wrote my blog post for disabled writers that's now been largely incorporated into the summer workshop FAQ).

Please feel free to share your experiences as someone with disability(ies) at Clarion West here

I don't think it came up much but I did sometimes critique pieces with disabled characters from a disability advocate perspective and I think that went ok. 

One instructor responded to one of my critiques by saying they didn't think the (explicitly disabled) character in someone's submission was disabled, just different, and referenced a younger relative as the basis for their saying that, and that was obnoxious but not a huge deal. 

How often did you feel safe and supported to share your insight, ideas, and feedback as a disabled or neurodivergent staff member, board member, instructor, or alum at Clarion West? (If you aren’t disabled or neurodivergent, please skip this question).
I critiqued 


Clarion West is the best workshop I've done. Apart from that, though: I took an online Gotham Writers Workshop SFF class with Michaela Roessner in early 2016, before attending Clarion West. She's extremely skilled at reading a submission and divining what precise advice the writer needs to improve, as well as coming up with . I think about that a lot when critiquing: not just what a piece needs, but what the piece's writer can realistically implement.

The social environment was quite welcoming. From a blog post I wrote about my experiences: "Science fiction and fantasy writers tend to be both eccentric and tolerant of eccentricity. I was out as autistic and otherwise disabled, and nobody treated me weirdly. I found everyone very welcoming and accepting, both for that and in general."

Relevant to the committee focus on the critique process: 

1) The critique process could include an (optional) opportunity for writers to talk about their goals for a piece ahead of time, so that critiques could focus on helping writers meet their goals for a piece as well as making it more publishable.

I think the reason our critique process has no formal space for author intent is that critiquers are assumed to be stand-ins for readers of a published work and for gatekeepers, but a submission hasn't been published or submitted for publication. Critiques at this stage are an opportunity to help each other implement our goals for a piece. At venues like Clarion West, we have ongoing critiquing relationships and also live together, so it's easier to develop the high degree of trust that's necessary to talk about some of our goals, which can be quite personal. This happens some, but informally. 

2) Critiquing relationships are two-way relationships and I think there are some parallels with, for example, romantic relationships in the usefulness of good tools for explicitly discussing and trouble-shooting the relationship. There might be ways to work more of that into discussions around critiquing at the workshop. (Especially because we're likely to wind up in critique groups or with critique partners after Clarion West, if we don't already have them.)

3) A separate point: I think it would help with diversity-related issues to encourage writers and critiquers to talk about audiences plural (and intended audiences), and readers plural, instead of "the audience" and "the reader". And also to encourage critiquers to keep in mind that even just being a writer means they differ in a significant way from most readers of published works.

Some of the worst critique fails I've seen happen when a critiquer completely misses what a writer was trying to do with a piece. Writer attempts Thing X, critiquer assumes they're attempting Thing Y and singles out Thing X as the bits that don't fit. That can hit writers harder when Thing X is related to a marginalized identity they have, but is often unhelpful even when it isn't.

I think the assumption is that critiquers are stand-ins for readers of a published work or gatekeepers of publications, who only have access to what's on the page. But workshop pieces aren't published works and haven't been submitted for publication, and critiquers are representative of only a tiny subset of readers and most aren't gatekeepers. 

. I don't think we should pretend that we're a reader (or "the" reader) 
, and in mutually supportive writing communities, we care about each other's goals. 

We talked about those goals some as students, but informally, not as part of the critique process, and unevenly: you'd have to be in the right place at the right time to be part of a conversation about it. I don't think goals for a piece should be
