[Minister of Propaganda for the Decepticon Empire — pro tip that has made my life much better:if...](https://fierceawakening.tumblr.com/post/632506798279163904)

If something upsets me to the point that I can feel my heart rate get faster (& therefore know it has triggered my sympathetic nervous system) I have started making a rule for myself to step away. wait a few hours. Think about it again. Not respond for 1-3 days.

    pro tip that has made my life much better:

    if something makes you upset, angry, defensive…interrogate that feeling. gently ask yourself why. unfold the feeling until you get to its core. it’s often not about what the other person is saying at all, but what you think it means. (sometimes they have outright said something bad! sometimes they haven’t, but the scared and unreasonable part of the brain heard something bad anyway!)

    this has been really helpful for me dealing with rsd, it’s very useful in workshop situations, it’s just a really helpful thing to do when feelings are running high–be gentle with yourself, but be honest, too. very few things are an attack meant for you, personally.
