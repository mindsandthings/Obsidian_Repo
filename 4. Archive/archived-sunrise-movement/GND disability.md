# GND disability
We talked about how all of the components of the GND need to include people with disabilities and how the ways that the system is currently set up excludes many people from living and participating in society equally, and how the GND's mandates for housing, healthcare, and jobs cannot replicate that. We talked about having a disability bill of rights as part of the GND - an idea the was actually brought up by AOC's legislative assistant.
