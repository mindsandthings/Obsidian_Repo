Hi Elizabeth! Hope you're doing well 
![](Convo%20with%20Amy%20about%20joining%20Sunrise%20disability%20team/1f642@2x.png)
 I've been really appreciative of your leadership with getting Sunrise to be more accessible and less ableist these past months. I was wondering if you had any interest in taking on a more formal role in the accessibility & disability team? We're working to establish ourselves as a more structured team and trying to fill some roles. **Currently, Abby Bresler & myself have been working with different departments to try to increase accessibility, but Abby has very little capacity for this now, since she is a full time student and new hub leader,** so we're looking for a couple other folks to step up and think you would be awesome for this. The time commitment would be about 3 hours a week, although it's flexible and could be more some weeks and less others depending on your schedule, what is going on, and how much you want to commit to it. Let me know if you'd be interested and if you'd wanna chat about this!

**Right now we're envisioning the accessibility & disability team as an accountability structure for Sunrise, an advisory team and a resource to support all parts of the movement as they do their own work to become more accessible and less ableist. We want to focus on holding Sunrise accountable for growing and learning in this area, and incorporating and acting on feedback.** Of course, this is just our initial vision and this may change as time goes on, but that's what we're thinking now!

 [3:10](https://sunrisemovement.slack.com/archives/DQ1LNUX5Y/p1580339446014300) 
**We're hoping the structure of the team can be several team leaders who manage a group of volunteers working on holding different areas of Sunrise accountable. These are the areas we want to focus on: mass calls, climate strikes, accessible spaces, accessibility and anti-ableism content, hub support role, and facilitating our own learning. (edited)** 

 [3:11](https://sunrisemovement.slack.com/archives/DQ1LNUX5Y/p1580339498015400) 
So as well as recruiting team leaders, we're also recruiting people to focus on those individual categories!

Let me ask you a couple questions, and then I'll think about it and get back to you in a few days?

 [3:12](https://sunrisemovement.slack.com/archives/DQ1LNUX5Y/p1580339530016000) 
Or actually, let me mention a couple things

￼
 [Amy Goldfischer](https://app.slack.com/team/ULTSS0CUT)    [3:12 PM](https://sunrisemovement.slack.com/archives/DQ1LNUX5Y/p1580339535016200) 
Absolutely, happy to answer any questions, and there is no rush at all

￼
 [Elizabeth Bartmess](https://app.slack.com/team/UPADCF66Q)    [3:13 PM](https://sunrisemovement.slack.com/archives/DQ1LNUX5Y/p1580339585017000) 
Ok - so the first is that I'm 40, and I wouldn't want to take away leadership positions from younger folks.

 [3:14](https://sunrisemovement.slack.com/archives/DQ1LNUX5Y/p1580339669018200) 
The second is that I'm good at working with information, but not very good at working with people, and in particular bad at convincing people to do things they're not already willing to do - I'm not very effective at it but I also get incredibly stressed out by it

 [3:15](https://sunrisemovement.slack.com/archives/DQ1LNUX5Y/p1580339756019500) 
I don't think I could manage volunteers, but if I have time (I'm not sure I do yet) I might be good at providing administrative support (documents or tools for coordinating people) (and I also like the editing and feedback work I've been doing)

 [3:16](https://sunrisemovement.slack.com/archives/DQ1LNUX5Y/p1580339797020000) 
So I'm not sure of the extent to which my skills overlap with what you need.

 [3:17](https://sunrisemovement.slack.com/archives/DQ1LNUX5Y/p1580339845021100) 
I'm also doing tech tool development for the data team, and that would have to be my primary commitment since there isn't anyone else working on those tools with me.

 [3:17](https://sunrisemovement.slack.com/archives/DQ1LNUX5Y/p1580339876021600) 
That may slow down some, but if something broke I would have to put my volunteer time into that until I'd fixed it.

 [3:20](https://sunrisemovement.slack.com/archives/DQ1LNUX5Y/p1580340053023800) 
So my question for you is whether, if I did formally commit to regular time for the accessibility and disability team, would there be a way to work it so that I was doing support and feedback and not volunteer management and outreach? And if I had something with the data team come up that need all my time for one (or possibly two) weeks, would there be a way to keep that from blocking anything critical?

Hi Elizabeth! Thank you for sharing your questions/concerns/thoughts. Regarding your age, we actually haven't talked about whether we are following the same guidelines that the rest of Sunrise does. I will talk to Abby and Sarah about it, and let you know, but my thoughts are that it does not matter. Sunrise has a lot to learn, and they should be doing that learning no matter what age group is pushing them to do so.

 [8:43](https://sunrisemovement.slack.com/archives/DQ1LNUX5Y/p1580402629009500) 
Your role can absolutely be shaped to minimize working with people and maximize working with information/administrative support/editing/feedback. These roles are super flexible and will change based on people's strengths, and we absolutely need those skills on this team!

 [8:47](https://sunrisemovement.slack.com/archives/DQ1LNUX5Y/p1580402830012300) 
Also, in terms of time commitment, it can absolutely be flexible there as well so you can prioritize your already committed Sunrise roles in data and tech tool development. Also, that's super cool that you are doing that! As a pretty tech illiterate person I very much admire people with tech skills.

 [8:47](https://sunrisemovement.slack.com/archives/DQ1LNUX5Y/p1580402851012600) 
So the answer to your last 2 questions are yes and yes!

￼
 [Amy Goldfischer](https://app.slack.com/team/ULTSS0CUT)    [8:53 AM](https://sunrisemovement.slack.com/archives/DQ1LNUX5Y/p1580403188017300) 
We could write out a role description with you which could describe what you'd be doing if that would be helpful. The roles that we wrote out are not set in stone/we definitely didn't think of all the roles we need. The editing and feedback work as well as administrative support skills that you can offer are incredibly helpful! Having you as an administrative support person, feedback provider & content editor would be awesome.

 [8:53](https://sunrisemovement.slack.com/archives/DQ1LNUX5Y/p1580403218018000) 
That being said, please take as much time as you need to think it over and let me know if you have any more questions, concerns, or thoughts that pop up.

Thank you! I will think about this, and get back to you on Monday.

 [12:54](https://sunrisemovement.slack.com/archives/DQ1LNUX5Y/p1580504049000800) 
Also, thank you for thinking of me - I realize I didn't put it in my initial response, but I'm flattered to be asked.

Sounds good

 I'm flattered you're considering!

Hello! I've thought about this and I would like to take you up on the offer. What is the best way to get started? (fyi, I'm out of town from Thursday through Tuesday and not sure what my schedule will be then)

￼
 [Amy Goldfischer](https://app.slack.com/team/ULTSS0CUT)    [8:20 PM](https://sunrisemovement.slack.com/archives/DQ1LNUX5Y/p1580790042004200) 
Awesome! Thank you so much for taking this on 
![](Convo%20with%20Amy%20about%20joining%20Sunrise%20disability%20team/1f642@2x.png)
 How about we write up a role description for you first? I can write up a draft tomorrow and send it to you to look over.

￼

Sounds great!

The first things I can anticipate you could work on would probably be finishing up the guides that we have been working on (like the accessible venue guide and the guide for trainers). I'm also going to be talking with Sarah Abbott and Abby tomorrow, so I'll have a better idea of other things that you could be working on in this role after tomorrow, and I'll let you know what they are thinking.

Hi Elizabeth, sorry for the delay, had quite a busy day. I will send you a role description tomorrow morning. Have a good evening!
