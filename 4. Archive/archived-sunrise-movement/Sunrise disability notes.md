hey everyone- just wanted to introduce myself. My name is Sarah Abbott and I join the Sunrise team in August as the Team Support and Culture director on Sunrise staff, and a component of my role is supporting internal justice, equity, and anti-oppression work within the movement. I am EXTREMELY grateful for this group and the proactive work you are already doing to make our movement more accessible. I am chronically ill and have various access needs, so this work is close to my heart. As I've come into Sunrise in the past two months, it's apparent that we have lots of room to grow re:accessibility and disability! and it's going to need to be volunteer led to go to the scale it needs to, so it's amazing that y'all are already here leading. I am meeting with Amy on Wednesday to talk more in depth, but wanted to make myself known as a resource on staff, and I look forward to collaborating with this crew.

Excerpt from Amy convo:

Currently, Abby Bresler & myself have been working with different departments to try to increase accessibility, but Abby has very little capacity for this now, since she is a full time student and new hub leader, so we're looking for a couple other folks to step up and think you would be awesome for this.
