M is a bully whom you have seen bully people before; you are not obligated to take her in good faith. When she agresses, say: "I'm not sure that sits completely right with me. I'll think about it and get back to you." PQ generally: Remember, hon, they're kind of intolerant, and they receive points for weaponizing the framework against you in order to appear more victimized. There are good people in there, but the framework has set up being a good person in a way that can harm you.
