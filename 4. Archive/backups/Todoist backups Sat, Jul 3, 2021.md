Well... I see two possible explanations here. One, anyone who isn't the host didn't really front most of the time and was merely sharing front with the host, hence they acted like the host in the process, in which case there's really no reason to be worried about your identity, alot of systems share front like that and it doesn't magically delete your personality. However if they don't want to share front with the host then the host probably has some work to do on themself. Two, you have a shell alter who can't leave front and it affects everyone that tries to front and your idea of the "host" is also tainted by that shell alter.

Review critiquing advice: I take notes each chapter as I'm reading, for a long piece, and then I write up a few paragraphs each of a report, starting with "What it's about / what happened" (useful 'cause if I got that wrong, that tells you something about how to take the feedback bit), "What worked well", "What didn't quite work", "Suggestions" (if wanted, and sectioned out so they can be discarded if needed), and then a summary of my overall response.
