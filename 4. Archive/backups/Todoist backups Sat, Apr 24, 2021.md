which is: I take notes each chapter as I'm reading, for a long piece, and then I write up a few paragraphs each of a report, starting with "What it's about / what happened" (useful 'cause if I got that wrong, that tells you something about how to take the feedback bit), "What worked well", "What didn't quite work", "Suggestions" (if wanted, and sectioned out so they can be discarded if needed), and then a summary of my overall response.

	* 

choose your battles when it comes to homeschooling
	* 

don't introduce people to tools in their field of study
	* 

remember that Gabriel unfriended you



	* 

don't sign up for diversity or disability things or anything approaching social justice ever again
May 11

	* 

Remember not to make suggestions or have opinions about how groups operate, especially when there are people from marginalized groups involved. Do not volunteer to do things; do not contribute more than the minimum; do not step in; do not be visible. If someone in power invites you to, distrust them, especially if it seems like they have the power to grant it. Your goal is to be one of the faceless masses. Your fawn response actively endangers you. Your cooperation response actively endangers you. Your instinct to connect actively endangers you.
Tomorrow

	* 

remember: people don't want something that will help them. they want to feel like the things they post and say help you.
Tomorrow

	* 

DO NOT BLOG. DO NOT WRITE ON TUMBLR. DO NOT TALK ABOUT IT.
Tomorrow

	* 

STOP WINNING THINGS. STOP COMPETING. STOP SHOWING OFF. STOP STANDING OUT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THOSE THINGS. THEY WILL ALIENATE OTHER PEOPLE AND YOU WILL BE A BAD PERSON.
Tomorrow

	* 

STOP SUGGESTING STUFF
Tomorrow

	* 

maybe I don't have to do anything about self-esteem. maybe that really doesn't matter, because these people aren't worth my maintaining a relationship with them. they're not worth my respect. maybe they're just where I am right now before I move on to something else.
Tomorrow

	* 

Stop sharing personal distress stuff about autism. Stop doing in Slack and stop doing it in the novel and in the footnotes. It suggests that you are competing for status as a marginalized person and trying to use trauma to get out of punishment. It also makes the whole place less comfortable to be.
Tomorrow

	* 

 [So, the TMA Season 4 âwait wait thereâs more!â Jon... - The Reason I Get Nothing Done](https://findingfeather.tumblr.com/post/616763211741626368/so-the-tma-season-4-wait-wait-theres-more-jon)  reread
Jan 1 2022

	* 

Careful around Miri Baker, who uses the "your best isn't good enough, do better" language
	* 

Each time you start a new venture: lay out conditions under which it is acceptable to contribute. Then, stick to those. If they work badly, adjust later, but don't adjust on the fly.
Tomorrow

	* 

If someone is performing a job and having difficulty or being tired, do not try to take it away from them just because you want to do it (for example, holding the baby). They will experience it as criticism. Instead, make it about you.
Saturday




	* 

You are extremely overcommitted, and you cannot afford to spend extra time on something with a hint of a reward. You must focus on your chapters, the stuff for Ada, physical pain, and keeping the house clean.
Tomorrow




	* 

I set a challenge for you: don't show off. At all. You are *not supposed to be the best*. You are *not supposed to be visibly good*. You are supposed to be stable, independent, and happy.
Tomorrow




	* 

we need a genuine process of thinking over things before we send them out, and of alerting to our sense that we're being helpful, because being helpful results in us widening the discrepancy between ourselves and other people.
Tomorrow

	* 

Don't post suggestions that are helpful to teachers. DOn't be helpful. KNOW. YOUR. PLACE.
Tomorrow

	* 

Also, remember that people who want you to do things on hard copy are *obsessed* with it. It's a religious point for them. Don't go digital.
Tomorrow

	* 

The best way to think about this is: you need to match other people's indifference.
Tomorrow

	* 

if you feel like you are showing off, that is the point at which to stop. you have no need to show off.
Tomorrow

	* 

Seriously, tune it down. You could have a friend but you'll scare her off and make her feel bad about herself.
Tomorrow

	* 

remember that RH/YK/synagogue services are political overload
Sep 1

	* 

Remember: no more collaborations or interactions with R, she doesn't respect your time and energy and doesn't want to talk to you; A is exploitative and doesn't follow through; R/B are not your friends, they harm communities; Sara L. is irresponsible; J.M. never stops talking; don't post in the autism channel
May 10

	* 

M is a bully whom you have seen bully people before; you are not obligated to take her in good faith. When she agresses, say: "I'm not sure that sits completely right with me. I'll think about it and get back to you." PQ generally: Remember, hon, they're kind of intolerant, and they receive points for weaponizing the framework against you in order to appear more victimized. There are good people in there, but the framework has set up being a good person in a way that can harm you.
May 10

	* 

Other people need to have a perception that they are in CONTROL. Ask yourself: will this make someone feel like they are losing control of the situation? Like their expectations aren't accurate or reliable? You don't want to do that to people.
Tomorrow

	* 

Remember that tech support triggers communication trauma
