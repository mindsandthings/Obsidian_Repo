# Faerie story notes

Retrieval services picked you up too early

Your parent cares about you
Your parent does not care about you

Human changeling: body-modded with iron

Your counterpart's parent cares about them
Your counterpart's parent does not care about them

Your parent told you about your background
Your parent did not tell you about your background. 

The unhappy one gets adopted
