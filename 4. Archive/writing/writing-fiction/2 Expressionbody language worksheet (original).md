Emotions, expressions, and body language worksheet

	1.	Check my notes on the character's habitual motivation and emotions.
	2.	For each piece of the scene, identify and characterize emotions. 
	⁃	What's the character's mindset/motivations? What emotion(s) would they be feeling?
	⁃	Are they trying to suppress it, or show a more socially acceptable emotion? If so, what? 
	⁃	How intense and long is the emotion? Fleeting, mild, moderate, intense, sustained? 
	3.	Look up the emotion(s) in the emotion thesaurus. 
	⁃	Does the entry match what I'm thinking of? Check the lists of emotions it escalates into and de-escalates into to see if one fits better. 
	⁃	Pick a couple physical signals, internal sensations, or mental responses that I can see the character doing (also, check the associated list of power verbs). 
	⁃	If the emotion's being suppressed, pick one or more signs that it's being suppressed. 
	⁃	What else do I see the character doing here? Remember I can look at the body language book too. 
	4.	Write it in words. 
	⁃	What would the POV character pick up on? How would they interpret it? 
	⁃	Remember mood-theming/situation-theming, using rhetorical devices, adding humor
	5.	Evaluate: 
	⁃	Does it enhance characterization? 
	⁃	Does it keep the reader grounded in the visuals? 
	⁃	Does it convey messages that contrast with dialogue, when needed? 
	⁃	Does it clarify ambiguous emotion in dialogue, or to show its intensity or lack of intensity (when it can't be inferred from dialogue)?
	⁃	Remember mood-theming/situation-theming, using rhetorical devices, adding humor
