# Claire’s Historical Fashion Reference & Resources

Last updated:10/16/2022

  

I first put this document together [back in 2014](https://shoomlah.tumblr.com/post/76245310670/claires-fancy-pants-historical-fashion-master), and haven’t gone through the process of doing a full update—adding new resources, culling any dead links—in some time. Four million years, I think? So here we are. I decided to reformat it somewhat this time around: rather than sorting by books-vs-online resources, I’m sorting by era/region, and using 📚 and 💻 emoji to clearly denote what’s available as a book or online ( or 🧵 for sewing resources). That means that if you’re looking for a particular century, you shouldn’t have to dig around in more than one place!

  

This list is by no means an exhaustive one- it’s a list of (primarily western for now) historical fashion resources, both online and offline, that is limited to what I know, own, or use! It’s a work in progress, and I’m definitely hoping to expand on it as my knowledge base grows. First things first, how about a little:

## Advice for Researching Historical Fashion (or anything, really)

-   Read, and read about more than just costuming. Allowing yourself to understand the cultural and historical context surrounding the clothing of a particular region/period can be invaluable in sussing out good costume design. Looking at pictures is all well and good, but reading about societal mores, about construction techniques, daily routines, local traditions & symbolism, and whatever else will really help you understand the rhyme and reason behind costuming in any given context.
    
-   Expand your costume vocabulary. When you’re delving into a new topic, costuming or otherwise, picking up new terminology is essential to proper understanding and furthering your research. Write down or take note of terms as you come across them- google them, look up synonyms, and use those words as a jumping off point for more research. What’s a wire rebato? How does it differ from a supportasse? Inquiring minds want to know.
    
-   Double-check your sources. Especially on the internet, and doubly especially on tumblr/pinterest/tiktok. I love them (and use them!), but they can be ground zero for rapidly spreading misinformation. Books are often your safest bet, but also take into account their date of publication, and who’s writing them—an author’s biases can severely confuse or misconstrue how they’re interpreting their original source material.
    
-   Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Do everything you can to find out information on your own, but feel free to reach out to people with more specialized areas of knowledge for help! Be considerate about it- the people you’re asking are busy as well- but a specific line of questioning that proves you’re passionate and that you respect their subject matter expertise can work wonders.
    
-   Keep track of the information you find. There’s nothing more infuriating or heartbreaking than trying to remember where you saw that one particular jacket with the sleeves that do that thing—whether it’s using PureRef, a google doc, bookmarks, a post-it, anything: keep track of what you find so you can come back to it later!

    Online: [free to borrow on Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/whatpeoplewore0000gors/mode/2up) 💻  
    One of those “I am putting this here because I used it a ton when I was younger” books—a great survey to browse through, but full of illustrations based off of other work so definitely to be taken with a grain of salt.

    Online: [free to borrow on Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/historicalencycl00raci/mode/2up) 💻

    A collection of both Racinet and Hottentoth’s costume plates from the 19th century, but with some additional context and copy that is missing from Racinet’s original.

    The Met has graciously uploaded a substantial portion of its library for perusal and download, including over 50 books on historical fashion.  I might call out a couple of them specifically throughout this document, but it’s worth browsing through the entire collection.

    Fantastic survey of fashion as seen in period art, paintings, magazines, patterns, etc. Tons of information, clearly arranged by century/time period.
    
-   [Wikipedia’s History of Western Fashion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Western_fashion) 💻  
    Shouldn’t be the be all, end all resource for historical costuming, but a surprisingly robust  jumping off point for when you're trying to initially pin down a period of historical fashion.  It is definitely a high-level overview, though- you’ll need to delve into more costume-specific sites as well.
    
-   [The Cutter’s Guide](https://twitter.com/siamcostumes) 💻  
    Kind of a mind-boggling number of visual references and resources put together by Siam Costumes, a costume house out of Thailand.

    A fantastic resource for day-to-day clothing from the 19th and early 20th centuries, even if it isn’t catered specifically to fashion photography.

### Miscellany

#### CATALOGS and FASHION PLATES

Clothing and store catalogs are a fantastic resource, though they’re obviously limited to the advent of the department store and beyond.  They’re a fantastic snapshot of what was in-style for everyday folk during a particular year, and they also have a breadth of detail and variety that you wouldn’t be able to see otherwise.  One thing to keep in mind is that people weren’t always on the cutting edge of fashion- if you’re designing clothes for a character in 1887, you can look at catalogs from the decades prior as well.

### Historical Fashion Blogs

There are so many blogs out there that you can follow on historical fashion, so this is a woefully short list.  These are just talented costumers who I’ve stumbled across over the past couple of years; most (if not all) of them fabricate costumes as well as researching/writing about it, so they really know their stuff:

-   [All The Pretty Dresses](http://extantgowns.blogspot.com/) 💻  
    A blog cataloging extant garments in private collections, up to 1929. Hasn’t been updated in a white, but a great resource for seeing clothing outside of museum collections.
    
-   [Diary of a Mantua Maker](http://mantuadiary.blogspot.com/) 💻  
    Historical fashion blog, focusing primarily on the late 18th century.  A deep dive, and a very satisfying one.  Her work is gorgeous.
