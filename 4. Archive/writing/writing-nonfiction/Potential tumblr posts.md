*_Social norms about socializing and asking questions_*
 
(Especially one large group of friends who did not ever ask each other questions about anything at all. They just talked about their own interests. I can see an adapted version of that being great - turn-taking infodumping can be awesome - but in this case they didn’t seem to care about or be interested in each other, at all, and the group was very gender-binaried and whose knowledge was seen as legitimate knowledge and who only ever got to be an audience fell into that binary along predictable lines.)
 
 
I’ve been surprised, in general, by how so many people don’t seem to have any interest in

(It was also a very gender-binaried group and who was considered a legitimate speaker and who was assigned to be an admiring audience fell into that gender binary along predictable lines.)
 
 
*_Things that I now think are true about therapy_*
 
 
	* Therapists think verbal skills are equivalent to problem-solving ability, and
	* Therapist training teaches a particular version of hyper-neurotypicality 
*  
	* Therapists expect clients to not be initially trusting, but to become more trusting over the course of a few sessions. If I start out trusting them, they never get the emotional hit of feeling me open up, so they believe I don’t trust them. Sometimes they respond to this by demanding trust I’m already giving, 
	* Most therapists believe it’s okay to 
	* The reason that “you’re very smart” is directly followed by ceasing to take the client seriously is that 
	* Therapists do not like clients setting boundaries.  
	* Therapists like having particular kinds of interpersonal experiences in therapy. 
	* Therapists treat some clients like “easy A’s” - people with whom you can get a good outcome without having to do difficult work. (I suspect for me this has to do with demographic similarities to the therapist
	* When a therapist compliments a client on being smart, 
	* Therapists mistake clients’ explanations of problems for insights achieved in therapy, and also mistakenly believe that insight is adequate to create change. This is why
	* Therapists believe that clients can always rely on the privileges the therapists believes their clients have access to

	* Someone can have consistent bad experiences across therapists

*_ADHD/Narcissism_*
 
I'm reading a book for women with ADHD. 
 
It talks about clutter and self-image…and it completely leaves out other people except for as people who might gaze and make you feel bad
There's no acknowledgement of actions/failures to act that have negative consequences for other people. Especially missed deadlines and forgotten/dropped commitments, which is a huge issue for me—both difficulty meeting them, and having other people with executive dysfunction miss and drop commitments to me and not communicate about them at all and then expect me to make up for them. 
Even more noticeable is the lack of acknowledgement that anyone reading the book might genuinely want to not to crap out on other people because they have sympathy for other people and understand what it is like to have someone create headaches for you, or burden you with their dysfunction on top of your own.
I can have a small amount of understanding for an individual if they're very unable to meet commitments and surrounded by people who always do, but for an author who has ADHD and has worked with people witih ADHD and considers themselves an expert on it, it's really weird.
It's a very narcissistic approach to ADHD: the only time other people come into the picture is when their actions make us feel bad.
 
Sometimes, when someone asks for accommodations or starts asserting their need for accommodations, the reason they get pushback is that other people have the same problems they have, and already give all they can. 
 
And the thing is…I've done a lot of collaboration with other autistic people with executive dysfunction (sometimes because of co-ocurring ADHD), and this is actually pretty frequently my experience. And it's the reason that I wind up 1) coordinating them (because I'm willing to make up for everyone else's executive dysfunction—this even extends to neurotypical people, because I have systems) and 2) I wind up incredibly stressed out and angry. Because it isn't that people necessarily /can't/ remember to, for example, turn in a written submission for group critique on time…it's that the consequences are that the group doesn't happen.
 
And because this is unrecognized work (it might get called "emotional labor", but what it is is executive function labor), because it is both neurotypical work and women's work, people with ADHD seem /really/ unaware that other people are putting actual effort into handling it for them.
