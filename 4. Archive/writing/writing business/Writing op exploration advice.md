# Writing op exploration advice

From Amy Z. Chan: 

I would say reading a lot in the market to get a sense of what readers want, and as well as reviews of those books. Pay attention to what the reviewers are saying they loved and hated. If you are thinking of going indie, the best authors to pay attention to are the debut / newish ones in your genre that no one has ever heard of but are selling well. Big name established authors can do things that newbie authors can't.

Also networking with other indies in my genre. I have a weekly virtual Zoom lunch with a group of indies in my genre that I met at a conference and we regularly talk about who is selling well, and why we think they are selling well. That has also helped a lot.
