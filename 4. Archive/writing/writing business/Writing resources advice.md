# Writing resources advice



I started focusing seriously on fiction writing like 6 years ago and can't remember what I initially used, other than some books on the snowflake method for plotting novels. Nanowrimo sites might have some good resources for beginning novelists, if you're interested in novels. I also took several online courses through Gotham Writers, which were good introductory courses. Margie Lawson's site has some great intermediate and advanced courses, although I've found the intro courses vary widely in quality. (Some of them have reviews, though, so those might be helpful.) 

If you listen to podcasts, I recommend Writing Excuses. If you're interested in writing humor, I recommend the book "The Cheeky Monkey". For thrillers and suspense novels, Carolyn Wheat's "How to write killer fiction" is good. For motivation and procrastination, Hillary Rettig's "The 7 Secrets of the Prolific". Be aware that the publication industry changes rapidly, and any advice more than five years old is likely to be out of date.
