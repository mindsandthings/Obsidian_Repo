    I hope itâ€™s ok to ask this hereâ€¦ after my last micro coaching session I decided to set some self pub goals. Iâ€™ve only been pursuing trad pub for the last several years and the learner in me wants to absorb as much info as I can about this. Wondering if people here know if any good groups or resources for this? Looking for a FB group or YT channel or something like that if you know of any. Or open to however you get your best info! Many thanks!!

    The Wide for the Win Facebook group is good too

    They have a "tree of knowledge" series of posts that has pretty much everything you could possibly want to know in it

    If you're looking for an organized course, I've heard that Sarra Cannon's Publish and Thrive course is really good.
