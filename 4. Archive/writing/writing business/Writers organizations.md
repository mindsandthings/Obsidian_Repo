# Writers organizations
List from introductions posted by people to Margie courses


Sisters In Crime ($50): https://www.sistersincrime.org/page/join-now Includes critique groups and other community stuff. 

Maybe consider some of Margie's co-writing sessions?

Women's Fiction Writers Association ($48): "Women's Fiction Writers Association is an inclusive organization of writers creating layered stories in which the plot is driven by the main character’s emotional journey." Has occasional thrillers but seems to be mostly stuff I don't read. See https://wfwa.memberclicks.net/star-award-past-winners

Mystery Writers of AmericaL https://mwanorcal.org and https://mysterywriters.org. I don't get any sense of their focus and mostly don't recognize what books of theirs I can find. 

League of Romance writers - https://www.leagueromwriters.com/our-authors-2/ - almost all slightly older white women

Futuristic, Fantasy, and Paranormal group within RWA

Author’s Guild - no sense of fit

PNWA (Pacific Northwest Writers Association): I don't have a sense of fit

NINC: no
