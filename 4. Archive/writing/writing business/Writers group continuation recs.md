# Writers group continuation recs



You may luck into a group of highly committed people with enough time to write who are still consistently submitting years later. In my experience, people often trail off on submissions after six months to a year, usually due to other commitments they have to prioritize (work, school, family, health, etc). As the submission cycle becomes less reliable, previously committed people fall away. 
Typically, people like being part of the group and don't want to leave, especially if you're friends outside of the group. They're unlikely to back out on their own. Be prepared to actively ask people to leave the group and be aware that if the way you ask it is "do you want to still be a member and submit regularly" they will say yes, even if in practice they don't have the time. 
Part of being prepared to ask people to leave is having other people available to take their place quickly. Have a list of potential invitees. Actively look for and add people to that list. Remember that not all of them will want to join. 
*If you can*, try to have at least 2-3 active members who write regularly enough or fast enough that there will always be at least one thing to critique. (This is easier said than done, obviously. My best suggestion is to take it into account when you're thinking about potential invitees.)
An alternative is having some critique sessions be co-working sessions instead. This can keep a group going for a little while, but my experience is that if you're doing this because submissions have dropped off, it usually leads to people becoming less likely to show up at all. 
Actively go over the schedule for the next 2-3 submission cycles with the group. Check that everyone knows what they're supposed to be doing when. If your group meets IRL or virtually, ask everyone to check their schedules for upcoming travel, even if you meet regularly. Otherwise, they might notify you an hour before the meeting that they're on an out-of-town trip that they've known about for several weeks, or might notify you fifteen minutes into the meeting, or not at all.
