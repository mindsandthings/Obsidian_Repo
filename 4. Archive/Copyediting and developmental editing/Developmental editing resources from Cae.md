So great to talk to you today!

I’ve attached both the Editorial Letter and the annotated manuscript for a novel I worked on towards the end of last year. Obviously extremely confidential between me and my client, so please don’t share it with anyone else (not that I think you would, but it’s best to be safe!). Hopefully it’s useful in seeing what I do as part of the full developmental editing service, and how I go about sharing critique with an author who is reasonably thick-skinned but still in the early stages of their writing journey. In this case, the author had a really cracking premise and good instincts for writing a twisty and interesting plot, but needed some help with the more basic building blocks of storytelling. Honestly very typical of the kind of weaknesses I see in my clients’ manuscripts: too much telling, not enough conflict, and a vague/head-hoppy point of view. Those three problems turn up so often that I’ve developed set ways of covering them in editorial letters, like the “David felt anxious” approach to explaining show don’t tell that I use in this one.

I’ve also attached a copy of my contract template. It’s very simply, but it does everything it needs to do!

Last but not least, here are some Facebook groups that might be useful:

*Fantasy Writers Forever!*

https://www.facebook.com/groups/CouncilOfFantasyWriters/

This is the main group I’ve got clients from. They have a set day for promoting things, and I’ve gotten a couple of clients this way.

*Fantasy Writers Support Group*

https://www.facebook.com/groups/1800355053523765/

Similar to the one above, and the same rules around set promo days. I’ve not had any bites from here, but that’s probably just the luck of the draw.

*20 Books to 50k*

https://www.facebook.com/groups/20Booksto50k

A group for people following a popular method for making $50k a year from self-publishing—mostly by writing a shitload of books and writing to specific markets. I’m not sure if they allow promotion, but the group has been really helpful in understanding the self-publishing process, what is involved, what the common problems are, etc. That comes in handy when I’m working with clients who are considering self-publication.

*Ask a Book Editor*

https://www.facebook.com/groups/askabookeditor/

A group where people can ask editors questions. Honestly I don’t really participate in it, and mostly joined just because it’s a prerequisite for joining the group below.

*Ask a Book Editor – Help Wanted*

https://www.facebook.com/groups/313221489140919/

A place where people specifically ask for (and contract) freelance editors to do various sorts of editing work on their novels. It’s not been massively helpful in my experience, since it’s a bit of a race to the bottom in terms of price, and there are always at least a dozen editors that have commented before I even see something, but that last one may just be a time zone thing. I could see this being really useful for getting a couple of editing jobs under your belt and beginning to build a portfolio. Especially if you’re struggling to get those first couple of jobs charging your full rate.
