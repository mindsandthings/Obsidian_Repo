# Coaching notes
Can you give me some examples of how you tailor your approach? 

I get stuck and run out of reward responsiveness
or I just get super dysregulated 
I have to use a relaxing thing to get through a pain episode but I get hooked on it (games)

I need to be able to get moving and not just get stuck a long time

and I need to do it in the absence of external structure

and I need to be able to cope with teh build-up of urgent things to do

and also with other people's expectations that I be able to start doing things immediately once no longer in intense pain instead of having a boot-up period
