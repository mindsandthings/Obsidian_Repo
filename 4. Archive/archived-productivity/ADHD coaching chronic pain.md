Hello, I'm looking for life coaching to help with starting, switching, and stopping tasks. Do you have experience adapting ADHD coaching for people with fluctuating chronic pain that periodically destroys their ADHD management structures? If you do, what is your availability and pricing?


Best,

Elizabeth 




### Unpredictable, fluctuating chronic pain that frequently disrupts effortfully-built habits and routines. 


### I have specific difficulties starting, switching, and stopping tasks, made worse by unpredictable chronic pain issues. 

### I know how to create and maintain habits and routines

### When I'm temporarily not in pain, habits and routines can carry me through starting, switching, and stopping tasks. If I lose momentum, I lose the habits and routines, and have to put in extreme effort to rebuild them. 

### I desperately want to maintain access to these habits and routines, so I push through pain when possible. This causes the pain to worsen to the point 

### Those habits and routines are then interrupted by physical health issues that prevent me from carrying out tasks. Each time that happens, I have to rebuild habits and routines from scratch.
