# Things vs Omnifocus vs Todoist


In Things, tasks can repeat weekly or daily, but there’s no awareness of weekends, so it’s impossible for me to set up this particular repeat pattern. Even something simpler, like repeating every other weekday, I would have to set up manually in the repeat settings for the task.


certain aspects like repeat scheduling can’t be set up at capture at all in Things—you have to create the task first, then navigate to it and access its repeat settings.
Lack of Web Access

The burden of supporting multiple platforms with a native app on each is heavy, so I understand why the Things team hasn’t been eager to take that on.

Todoist is a subscription ($36/y, though there’s also a free tier) whereas Things is a one-time purchase on each platform (you’ll spend $80 getting it on macOS, iOS, and iPadOS).

The Standard version of OmniFocus for macOS sells for $49.99, while the Pro version costs $99.99. For iOS, the standard version costs $39.99 while the Pro version is $59.99. If you want to use the Pro version of OmniFocus on your Mac and your iPhone, you'll need to buy both versions for $159.98. 

Things also uses separate pricing for every version of the app. The macOS version of Things 3 sells for $49.99, while the iPhone version sells for $9.99. The iPad version---yes, it's a separate version---sells for $19.99. 

Things cannot hide tasks that you can’t work on right now because Things does not support sequential projects. For some people, that might be a dealbreaker. If you want to keep track of exactly what you could work on right now, that’s just hard to do in Things. 

Overall, OmniFocus gives you more flexibility in organizing your projects. I once worked with someone who owns a small construction business: his company installs doors in newly-built houses. At any time, he might be keeping track of 50 houses that need doors installed. For someone like him, OmniFocus is a great choice, because OmniFocus’s flexibility allows him to choose exactly what to show when.

By contrast, Things limits your organization. That could be a plus or a minus for you. I’ve worked with plenty of people who got bogged down on setting up OmniFocus—and found that when the switched to the simpler Things, they stopped tinkering with their task manager and started getting stuff done.

Both apps let you assign due dates, although they’re called deadlines in Things. These work as you would expect. The difference lies in the other types of dates available.

In OmniFocus, there are defer dates. When you defer a task until a certain date, you imply that the task is not available to work on until that date, or that you don't intend to work on it until that date. OmniFocus then hides that task from many views.

By contrast, Things has a date that I’ll call—even though it sounds a bit odd—the when date. When you assign the “when” date to a task, that implies that you intend to work on that task on that date.

In OmniFocus, you're saying “I’ll work on that task on Tuesday or later”, while in Things you're saying “I’ll work on that task on Tuesday”. There’s no “or later” bit in Things; once you assign a “when” date, Things will continue to show that task in its Today view until you complete it, delete it, or reschedule it.


Both OmniFocus and Things integrate with your calendar.


A major difference between OmniFocus and Things is that OmniFocus has built-in review functionality, while Things does not. If you tend to review all of your projects in one go, once a week or on some other fixed schedule, this isn’t a big deal. But if you anticipate sometimes getting interrupted mid-review and having to get back to it later, then in Things you’ll have to keep track of where in your review you were. By contrast, OmniFocus keeps track for you as long as you mark each project as reviewed when you’re done with it.
