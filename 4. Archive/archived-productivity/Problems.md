# Problems
Turn into a set of areas
Wed checkins: check in on each area (current status, what I've accomplished in the last week, next steps)

Used to have small goals to keep moving forward. Now it's all novel stuff including scene/chapter daily goals. 
No goals other than writing
Difficulty getting moving in morning
Nothing new and stimulating. 
Where is my life going?

Like people's embassy
Would like longer term life goals (1-2 years, break down to smaller ones)
Daily writing goals and contributing to a career

Animal Crossing - takes a little longer than ideal - want a breakfast + lying thing that's 1/2 hour. TV shows require hearing aids. 

Post-pandemic: more socialization pressure, maybe classes, maybe glasses

Do I want career path/work?
Probably consulting/contracts - just 1 contact, not a team
DS - not sure what would do or what expectations also high stress and no code review

Morning stuff:
Need routine, hard to get cemented
Send Kris co-worker group info
Check Tiimo API and hire programmer to fix push-forward problem
Rec Design Life book
Talk 2 bass teacher about prospects and next goal

Q:
find timer options, explore
Also life coach
Wed checkins: report back
Attitude: make sure I won't be stuck; make sure I have time and resources to try lots of things
