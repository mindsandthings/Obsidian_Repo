I've been using the Tiimo app to help me keep visual track of my day and have found it very helpful - it crosses the bridge between a calendar app and a checklist app, basically giving you the ability to set specific checklists at specific times of day, with an optional visual timer showing you how much time is elapsed and left for that activity. It's a paid app ($4.49/month, cheaper yearly, free 2-week trial) that was developed via research with autistic youth.  [https://www.tiimoapp.com/faq](https://www.tiimoapp.com/faq)

It specifically helps me with the problem where I need to be able to easily see how much time I have left to complete a given set of recurring tasks, and what all those tasks are (but just what the tasks are for that specific time, not all other times). It's not as flexible as I would like (it would be really useful to have some way to globally push all tasks half an hour forward in the day, for example, or to reorder by dragging and dropping) but I haven't found anything else that does this particular thing effectively.

I've also found the app Engross, which doesn't do all those things but may be worth checking out for people who want an app with a smoother user experience and don't need to be as zeroed in on just the current set of tasks.
