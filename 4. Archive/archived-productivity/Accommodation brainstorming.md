# Accommodation brainstorming
- Finish accommodations planning 

* "Hi, I would like to make an appointment for an adult autism assessment. I understand that ___ and ___ ____ there both do them. What's involved in that process?" 
 
I also can't be tasked with being solely responsible for handling other people's inability to communicate clearly. 
 
I'm not actually able to extract compliance from people I have no authority over. I've been placed on multiple occasions into extracting cooperation from people who have already repeatedly refused to cooperate with their actual managers—I'm not going to be more successful. 
 
Sometimes I really do need help extracting what's relevant about something. 
 
I need to be able to ask for information in email, and have my questions answered, even if I ask more than one question in the email. If someone isn't able to give written answers, or is unwilling to, I need someone else to extract the information. I need to not have the topic changed. If a third party I need to correspond with starts deliberately trying to evade questions, I need support. If I ask a question I need an answer, even if the answer is "I'm not willing to answer this question" I need an explicit agreement on how to get my emailed questions answered. 
 
If a co-worker repeatedly breaks my concentration, especially if they keep doing "and another thing", I can't do it. 
 
 
*Work*
* Kind of thing

* What I need

* Why

* Interpersonal backup

* Someone else ensures others questions, requests, and needed work responded to, if my initial attempts do not work or someone else is persistently recalcitrant or repeatedly evasive. 
 
If tasked with gaining others' compliance, need ability to actually give them consequences for noncompliance. 

* I can't force them to, and am often not believed that people will refuse to answer polite requests until manager/etc sees it for themselves. 
 
When my work is reliant on input or work from others, and they actively or passively refuse to provide it, I can't do my job.

* ???

* To not be assigned to extract compliance or "round up" or keep in line or "manage from below" other people. 
 
Emotional caretaking in lieu of job tasks, or when it directly conflicts with my performing job tasks 
 
As long as I am polite and appropriate, that should be enough. I will be diplomatic to the best of my ability but sometimes the best I can do is ask directly. 

*  

* Workload management

* Executive function - sometimes I will volunteer to help organize/remember something for someone, but I do not want to be tasked with handling other people's executive function in ways that other people in my position are not routinely tasked with simply because I seem like an organized person

*  

* Workload management

* Clear lines of responsibility - [explain what this means]
 
Both for work due to who, and for who is responsible for making decisions
 
I need to know where my authority is so that I'm not put in the position of having to try to read into someone's ignoring my question to mean whether they think the decision should be my responsibility and they've declined to inform me of that because they think I should already know, or whether they'll be angry at me later. 

*  

* Written materials

* Written instructions or response summaries if someone's verbal communication was too disorganized for me to follow.

*  

* Workload management

* Support for load-lightening and renegotiating deadlines if I request it; if response is to ask me to delegate, I need extra load reduction in order to put in additional time training someone else to do my work
 
Support for acquiring work, if the norm is for people to convince others to let them do work
 
I need to be able to say "I have too much work; I need help offloading some, or help deciding what to not do". I need people to understand that my work takes longer than it looks like, and that if I am coping with a workload, it doesn't mean I can take on more. Basically I need normal requests for managerial support to not be discounted. 

* Executive functioning issues. 
 
It takes me several times longer to delegate than to do things myself because of how long it takes me to convert what I do into something others can understand

* Ability to leave a situation

* In some situations, especially interpersonal conflict, I need to be able to leave the room to manage my distress so that I am not publicly angry. 

*  

* Interpersonal backup

* I cannot meet alone with people with a history of retaliating against people or expressing rage. If emailing, I need to be able to cc someone. 

*  

* Written materials

* For lectures, conferences, and trainings—anything where it is primarily a single person speaking for a long period of time—I need all materials in text or adequate captioning (sometimes automated captioning is adequate and sometimes it's not), accessible to me before or simultaneously with the training, including tests and evaluations. Sometimes this may be possible via a bluetooth mic and livetranscribe. If there will already be an ASL interpreter present that will work for me, but I would rather have written text. 
 
If Q&A is relevant, I need them to at least use the microphone

*  

* Written materials

* For meetings, videochats, or phonecalls, I may need post-meeting notes, if they are frequent, long, or involve speakers with non-American accents or difficulty speaking clearly. If captioning is sufficiently good to capture this, I may not need notes. 
 
I need the *option* to request communication via email (or print or handwritten notes if legible) in lieu of an in-person or phone meeting.
 
If automated captioning is available (e.g. skype for business) I would always like it. 

*  

* Ability to leave a situation, or shift to an adequate venue

* If a work-related event (including social events, trainings, meetings, phonecalls, and videocalls) requires auditory processing, I need to be able to leave without penalty if I can't hear well enough to have conversations or if I know I will be too exhausted from further auditory processing to do my work effectively, and provided the same information later in written format. 
 
If my participation is mandatory, or if I am needed there to supply information, I may need someone to cue me or repeat what was asked. 
 
I need to be able to leave without penalty, or shift venue to somewhere quieter, or have anything I miss recapped to me. 

*  

* Sensory

* Sensory-friendly clothing

* This is not a problem if the dress code is casual or business casual, but might be one if I were expected to wear a uniform

* Sensory

* Need to be allowed to wear noise-cancelling headphones, a quiet environment, put up a mirror so I can see people coming up behind me. If a loud worker I may need to switch desks.

*  

* Written materials

* If a class, I need homework assignments in writing, including any changes that are made verbally in class. 

*  

* Interpersonal backup? Other?

* Need to be able to raise hand or otherwise indicate I need to say something; need to ensure I get called on in videochat

* Difficulty judging pauses in multi-person discussions

* 
 
 
 
To get from another provider:
	* Heat intolerance
	* Lengthy standing: Need to be able to sit, including at receptions
	* Allergies (smoke, foods, other) - cannot work in regular proximity to a smoker; if temporary, need to be able to wear a filter mask
	* Need to be able to bring in own food and water and eat/meds on regular schedule
	* Can't disrupt sleep schedule heavily for travel
	* Travel problem - need to minimize travel (especially air travel, BART - vibrations). Can't travel casually. 
	* Severe muscle cramps - need delays
*  
	* Not knowing what will happen
		* Detailed info about new venues
	* No self-help trainings. 
	* Phone anxiety
	* If auditory material duplicates written material, I am extremely unlikely to gain anything extra
