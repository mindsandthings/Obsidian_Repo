Hi! I'm Telluric from California. I'm looking for a pomodoro buddy. I'm a writer and taking some community college classes.

Looking for: Someone to do regular pomodoros with via DM (25 minutes work then 5 minutes break to check in on goal completion, set goals for next sprint, and rest).

Duration: Test run and/or long-term.

Timezone: I'm in PST (GMT -5). I'm usually active from 9-6 or so PST (12-9 EST, 4-11pm GMT), but having someone even for part of that is helpful!

Reach out to me via: DM if you're interested.

32M solo entrepreneur (IT)

looking for: accountability partner

time zone: GMT +9 (but flexible)

duration: undetermined (as long as it's productive for both parties)

As a self-funded solo entrepreneur in the very early phase of the company, I wish there was more pressure to make me perform at my best.

Since I'm more likely to fulfill a pledge made to someone else rather than to myself, I'd love to have an accountability partner for both work related matters and more mundane things like waking up early. Also interested in schemes with a monetary penalty like Stickk (only for myself of course)

Feel free to DM if you think we could be a good match - I don't really care about your time zone or goal you're working on, I'm more interested in commitment and reliability.

Hi everyone, my name is Hannah and I am a 22F working full time in my first job after undergrad (non-profit). My ADHD makes it very difficult to work consistently throughout the day, especially after lunch from 2-5pm. I’d ideally like to connect with someone who is also new in their career, especially if you are struggling in the corporate world like me!

Looking for: accountability partner or someone to co-work with

Duration: Ongoing

Timezone (if applicable): UTC -4 (EST)

Looking for: Accountability partner

Timezone: PST (Los Angeles, Tijuana) but usually flexible

Duration: Undetermined. Maybe 3 months

Hi. My name is Angelica (28 F) and I'm trying to adapt to this new job. Going from academic student to academic writer sounds great in paper, but I've been struggling to commit to deadlines, and since I'm in the introduction period, the consequences haven't been severe, but I would like to create better habits.

I would really like to connect with someone that needs my help too, so we can work on whatever we are doing, together, just by checking how we are doing with our tasks or what we are struggling with.

I'm a medical doctor, so if you would like any tips about which techniques helped me to study better and get my degree, please feel welcome to ask.

Looking For: Freelance accountability partner

Duration: April 2022, Monday - Thursday

Timezone: UTC-4, but people from UTC-5, UTC-6 and UTC-7 can work

Hello! I'm Nikita and I am a 27-year-old freelance writer currently working on book reviews, personal essays and short stories to pitch to various magazines and newspapers abroad (I live in Guyana, South America). I am also taking a few writing and art courses to improve my craft. I struggle to focus on my own, but I would love an accountability buddy who also works during the day (10am-5pm with snack and lunch breaks) to work alongside so that I can keep on track with my work and courses.

I’m also a communications/journalism major so I would be happy to offer my partners mild editorial services in exchange.

Reach out to me via: DM's should work fine!

Looking For: an accountability partner whose support looks more like tough love than soft encouragement. Preferably in grad school or in the healthcare or creative (writing) sphere.

Duration: undetermined, hopefully longterm if we work well together

I'm a medical student in the US and am pretty self motivated but it would be nice to check in with tasks, related to studying/house work/creative work/fitness and diet.

Timezone: CST

Reach out to me via: DMs!
