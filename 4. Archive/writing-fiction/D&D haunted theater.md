# D&D haunted theater (2020? 2021? with Michael)
During a long-running series of plays, the creator hired a spellcaster to bewitch the audience into returning again and again until the series was completed. The creator also hired the spellcaster to prevent fans from directly expressing their wishes for how the ending would go. 

In the penultimate play, that part of the theater was overrun by magical pests (caused by the spellcaster in revenge for the proprietor shorting them on their pay). More recently, the entire theater building has become increasingly haunted by the ghosts of attendees who died (of unrelated reasons) since the plays were to end. They have been drawn back by the keep-coming-back spell, and can't leave until the play has been completed to their satisfaction. However, due to the other part of teh spell they can't directly express what would end it to their satisfaction. 

The players are asked to solve the haunting by the proprietor, who tries to keep them from finding out about the boarded-up part of the theater and the magical pests. 

The players must figure out that the haunting is associated with teh boarded-up part of the theater, enter it, and get rid of the magical pests. After doing so, they discover they can't leave the buildingâ€”the ghosts have locked them in. 

They must determine what each ghost wants out of the play, create a plot, and then perform the play themselves. 

Optimal ending: the ghosts are satisfied and decide to haunt the theater positively. They give the players loot dropped by the audience members in the rush to leave when the magical pests arrived, some of which has become magical. 

Middle good ending: the ghosts are satisfied and leave. The players find some loot.

Less good ending: the ghosts stop haunting the theater and instead become hecklers, yelling "boo" at the stage when plays displease them. 

Living NPCs:
 - proprietor, hired the person to cast the spells
 - janitor, knows everything that went on - overheard argument between proprietor and spellcaster

3 ghosts:
 - one that wants a romantic conclusion between two of the play's characters
 - one that wants the answer to a mystery
 - actor involved in the show, knows their fans, wants a better ending for their character than the one planned

copy of agreement between proprietor and spellcaster? (or angry note from spellcaster)

a script for the final play

can make friends with janitor by nerding out about the series (get info from actor ghost)

maybe janitor and one of the ghosts are in love. he has her obituary in his office. and maybe a picture of them together. (or maybe it's his son?}

newspaper articles about the ghost

the ghost does not want the players to get the janitor fired. 

if the players can bribe/blackmail the proprietor into stepping down, the janitor can become the new proprietor. purchasing it using the loot the players help find. and at the end the ghost and the son reunite. 

bonus: deliver loot to the spellworker

 - challenges other than fighting or talking to people that let the differetn players show off theri skills
 - borrow dm's guide to ensure I've got the official list of magical items to find

 - a couple ghosts as strategic allies
