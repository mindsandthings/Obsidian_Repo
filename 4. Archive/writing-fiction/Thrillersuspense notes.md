# Thriller/suspense notes

Wheat, Carolyn. How to Write Killer Fiction . SCB Distributors. Kindle Edition. 

Suspense from spy genre
involves the fate of the entire free world
Like the gothic heroine, the spy never knows whom to trust, but unlike her, he’s been thrust into a larger world and must operate within the customs of various countries. 
Even though there’s one protagonist we care about, there are usually several other characters whose viewpoints we see and whose plotlines we follow until they converge for the final confrontation/crisis. 

Personal Jeopardy
Personal jeopardy is at the heart of most gothic-tradition suspense novels. 
An ordinary person must pit his or her entire being against powerful enemies, and the suspense lies in whether or not our hero will survive and prevail. 
The person in jeopardy is not always the protagonist; parents become heroes to rescue their children, a husband or wife fights for a spouse captured by the enemy. 
The key is the struggle, the David-and-Goliath confrontation in which a person very much like ourselves must become braver, stronger, more heroic in order to win the unequal fight.

Spy fiction offshoots
So one challenge for the spy branch of the suspense tree is to make the conflict personal without losing the big-picture impact of its high stakes. Giving the reader a character to identify with at every turn helps a lot.

Suspense vs. Thriller 
What makes a suspense novel a thriller? Thriller writers aren’t afraid to take their plots, characters, situations, and locales to the max, pushing the envelope of credibility at every possible turn. They pile it on, pitting their protagonists against super-powerful enemies and putting obstacle upon obstacle in the way of success. They squeeze everything they can out of their settings, to the point where the reader ends up knowing more than he ever wanted to know about the internal workings of submarines or dinosaur DNA. And yet that’s part of the thrill inherent in the thriller: the sense of getting more than you bargained for, of being taken inside the inner circle and told things no one is supposed to know.


The Techno-Thriller 
Many techno-thrillers are based on what-if horror stories about technology gone awry. In fact, one aspect of the thriller market in general is its fascination with “systems gone mad”—we’ll see that medical thrillers focus on medical technology gone mad, legal thrillers zero in on the law gone mad, and so forth. 
...The theme, as exemplified perfectly by Michael Crichton’s Jurassic Park and its sequels, is that man is too flawed to be trusted with overly ambitious scientific projects. In other words, man shouldn’t play God by restoring extinct species to life. Even with the best motives in the world, evil will prevail in the end because hubris, that old human failing, always corrupts. 
The danger in writing a techno-thriller is falling in love with technology and forgetting to thrill. A second pitfall is making the technology more interesting than the characters.


Myths and dreams
Rites of passage


Structure of the suspense novel
Prologue: a scene that takes place before the action of the novel, establishing the character's ghost of the past. In other words, it’s setup. It creates deep doubt in the reader about the ability of the main character to deal with the stress of another hostage negotiation, and any reader with a brain will realize that the entire rest of the book will consist of putting him in exactly that position and letting us identify with him as he faces the ultimate test.

Arc One: In Hero’s Journey terms, this is the ordinary world the hero lives in before the big change that catapults him into the special world of challenge and fear, suspicion and skill mastery, tests and tasks, allies and enemies. We meet our protagonist and his world, the family, friends, lovers he thinks he can count on as allies. We learn his weaknesses, the inner need that this ordeal will resolve by testing him to the limit. We need the ordinary world so that the special world will be special enough. 

Accepting the adventure: 

every7 scene ends with a "no, and furthermore" or a "yes, but"
the prose is spare. Crais gives us just exactly as much information as we need to understand this moment in time and nothing more. There are no “extras” here, no long descriptive passages or internal monologues. We do go inside people’s heads from time to time, but for the most part, they think about what’s happening now, not what happened in the past. To the extent that the past enters into their thoughts, it’s for a few short paragraphs and it’s directly related to something happening in the present. One decision is quickly followed by consequences that lead to a second decision, new consequences, a third decision, etc. There isn’t much time for contemplation between events; one event happens right on top of another like a twenty-car pile-up on the Santa Ana Freeway. The dialogue is crisp, which means that people say exactly what they think in no more words than it takes to get the idea across. Everyone is businesslike, speaking to the point, which fits because there is much at stake and no time for small talk. Paragraphs are short, sentences shorter. All these devices working together create a sense of urgency.

Never let someone sit down in the second act. Something must be happening to your hero at all times; even moments of seeming safety must be fraught with possible danger. Will the peace last? Can this old friend be trusted? Will the police act, or have they been corrupted by the evil opponent? Can we cross the border into Poland or will the customs officials spot our phony passports?


The pendulum
The middle novel: hero veers wildly between trust and distrust, safety and danger. 
Tasks and tests increasing in danger and difficulty. 
Increasing isolation from support system: to force hero to fall back on her inner resources, so that it looks like she's earned it, so that the reader will identify with her. 
Hitting bottom scene - turning point of the novel, middle of the book. 
Rifts within the team as a middlebook suspense generator: internal conflicts must relate directly to the overall conflict. 
Raising the stakes: 

Arc three: hero becomes proactive (if arc 2 was a passive, taking-it-on-the-chin arc; other options are for arc 2 to have the hero fail because htier heart wasn't pure or because they were missing crucial info or after the wrong goal, which brings them to the hitting-bottom stage). 

Endings
Writ ethe last chapter first

Each time you revisit the confrontation scenes, ask yourself if you’re getting the most out of your characters, your situations, and your setting.

Ask yourself these questions: What is there in the setting that could be used as a weapon, either by the villain or the hero? How can the setting be made even more dangerous to the hero? Is the setting remote, so that outside help is unlikely? Are there natural dangers that threaten the hero as much as anything the villain could do? Does the setting have any other meaning in the story that takes on an ironic edge now that it’s become a place of confrontation and danger? Can the setting be made even more frightening by, say, turning out the lights, or cutting off the oxygen?

You’ll also notice that Barr gives the final-confrontation-in-the-cave situation three chapters from descent to ascent. That’s about right for a really well-developed climax, and you’ll also note that there are mini-goals and mini-arcs within those three chapters.

The middle of a fairy tale involves tasks and tests the hero must perform in order to win the princess. The tasks increase in danger and difficulty until finally the hero emerges triumphant over his older, stronger brothers. The same pattern exists in the suspense novel; the hero practices for the final confrontation by overcoming challenges from lesser opponents or by escaping from imprisonment. In some cases, the hero fails the early tests and appears to be on the verge of failing the final test as well. A certain amount of trial and error makes an interesting middlebook as your hero learns the skills he will need to confront the opponent in the end. And of course, a hero who has failed once or even twice creates a great deal of suspense as he goes for the third try. (Note the magic number three, a powerful number in fairy tales.)


But our hero by this time isn’t powerless. Whatever she learned in the middlebook comes into play now. All the new skills she’s mastered plus whatever strengths she started with need to be used. Any allies she made among the enemy ranks need to turn their coats now, and we need to believe in their transformation.
