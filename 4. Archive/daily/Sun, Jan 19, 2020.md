Pushed in at the right base of my skull and it clunked back into place and I feel so much better, after a week of headaches and being ok-ish last night until going on a walk and then crashing during the walk.
Symptoms today were:
* A sort of over-pulled painful burning raw feeling in my lower back and hips and side muscles, starting in the morning and increasing. 
* Incredible sleepiness this morning, starting with being somewhat sleepy and getting incredibly bad around 9:30
* Feeling like everything was burning all over with any movement and even with holding still
