Bedtime last night: 11:00. Could not sleep but due to mistiming melatonin.

Acetazolamide? n
DMSO? n
Clonazepam? y
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? went to bed at new, later time, but accidentally took melatonin too early. 

Pain management for today? 

Kind of out of it but not super so. Going to try stretching, see if it works.
