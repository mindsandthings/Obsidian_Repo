So stressed. Maybe it's absence of atenolol? The 1/2 a pill didn't seem to make a difference, but during the week seems much worse. idk. If it doesn't go away in a week I should go back onto 1/2 and see if it changes it. It could also be due to the headaches from chewies for aligners + starting Muldowney. I can't keep doing this, though. 

Yesterday night was so great and today I'm just wiped. It's also the heat I think. 

Maybe if I get a picnic blanket and my laptop and food and water I can just go and escape. I really want to get out right now. 

Therapy was frustrating. Felt like we just kept trying to solve the wrong problem and the problem is I can't trust myself to take breaks to enjoy anything later.
