tired
depressed can't write must program

did some gentle tugging/untugging this morning, helped. around ribs etc

Did Hannukah at Steve and Liza's. Made good latkes and sufganiyot. Janie was there. I could have been more social but I was not and I said a dumb thing about bass playing and feel it made me look bad and dumb to Steve.
