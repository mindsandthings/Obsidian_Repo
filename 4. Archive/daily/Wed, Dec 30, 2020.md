Acetazolamide? n
DMSO? n
Clonazepam? y
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? y but could not sleep

Pain management for today? 

Showered and did the ketoconazole shampoo. I think my head is itching less. 

Last night I did some pretty intense trigger point pressure on the collarbone ones and that seems to have helped.
