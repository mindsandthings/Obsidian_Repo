Slow start today. Stuff in CABS server re Nightshades - I hadn't realized they'd left months ago over folks objecting to the same issues I was triggered by. I suggested BC step back from modding if they wanted to advocate for Katie and they took it way better than I expected. 

Unsure about headspace. Had passing thought of adding an MLP and then there was an actual horse with wings and horn and now I just don't know if I'm making it up - conflicting views on when I went in briefly as to whether it was really there or not. Got confused and left. 

Relaxing in the relaxing room. ZThathelped. It's fall in there, and the wind blows the leaves along the floor. I guess it's open to the outside? I think before I had it underground. 

Feeling kind of stressed over 3 maternal figures now downstairs and will want me to do things when I go down.
