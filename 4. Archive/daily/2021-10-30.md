Wednesday was my last full working day as a User Assistance Developer (technical writer) at SAP SuccessFactors, I'm literally changing careers. It's exciting and scary at the same time. Inclusive Design is coming to SAP, and that's where I'm moving towards. Only two large companies have done Inclusive Design, Microsoft & Adobe. It will be a huge effort, the impact will be huge, from a product perspective, and eventually it'll boost Diversity and Inclusion at SAP. I'm very excited to start with my new team starting November 1. I'll miss my UA team at SuccessFactors...
