Very achy and tired esp hip after packing yesterday. Nerve glides helped some but weren't sufficient. A hot shower this morning seems to have fixed it though. 

Continuing with Muldowney, and kind of achy. Will keep doing at E&A but maybe I should put the ramp-up on hold in order to not trigger anything while going through the move.
