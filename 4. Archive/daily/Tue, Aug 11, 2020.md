Acetazolamide? n

Clonazepam? n
(prev night)

Went to bed on time?  y

Pain management for today?

Woke up an hour early feeling quite good, probably related to acetazolamide yesterday afternoon - which makes me wonder if before, when I took it right before bed, the problem wasn't the acetazolamide but the fact that it hadn't started working yet.
