(prev night)

Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today? 

Last night almost fell asleep then felt the switch in brain flip. Couldn't stop thinking about negative things. Wonder if it's someone switching in? 

Went for walk which was fine but then was quite achy. Took a while to relax then fixed upper back. Rubbing lower right ribs now.
