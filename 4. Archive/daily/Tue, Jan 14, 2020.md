Bad neckache/headache, to the point I took a opiate last night before bed and then was up very late because it made me not care if I fell asleep

a little better today. leaning back at an angle and letting my shoulders/arms hang down and back helps

scared of climate change, that this is when it turns to worldwide horror, this year
