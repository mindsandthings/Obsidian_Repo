Pain management for today?

apparently forgot to take the rest of my meds last night. 

yesterday played animal crossing most of day, then did spices. in a lot of pain while trying to sleep - right back of neck not pain but felt like touching and shouldn't be. hard to fall asleep. also very buzzy head buzzy agitated, in the physiological way. 

Today woke up. Still in pain but 3 ibuprofen seem to make it undetectable.
