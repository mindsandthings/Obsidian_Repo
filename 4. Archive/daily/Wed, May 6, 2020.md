Played games last night, took clonazepam to help sleep, still had trouble falling asleep even though it was a full one. 

Did get sleepy around 10, so have shifted melatonin to 9pm for tonight. 

Head achy after walk, felt stuffy, though the side to side head turn with rotating palms up fro TOS helped.
