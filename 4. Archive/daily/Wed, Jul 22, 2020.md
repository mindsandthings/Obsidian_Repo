Acetazolamide? n

Clonazepam? y, 2/3, around midnight
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? y

Pain management for today? nerve glides, de quervain's, try to fix ribs

Couldn't sleep till late, probably more because of stress/screen time right before bed than head tightness. Need to switch to reading tonight. 

Success with continuing working on head drainage position. Felt pretty good waking up, although later lower back cramped and an unusually high rib on my right side is out (maybe post-exercise? not sure). Felt unusually good standing up in morning.
