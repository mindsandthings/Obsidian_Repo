Went to bed on time? n

Pain management for today? 

Reduced lyrica some. Woke up in middle of night very awake, presumably from that, around 1:30am.

Back of head feels a little swollen. I do feel better overall from the trigger point work I did yesterday, though something on the left side of y neck is trying to tense tup.
