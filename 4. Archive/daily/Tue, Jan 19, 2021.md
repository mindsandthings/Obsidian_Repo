Pain management for today? 

Last night (this morning?) very tiny push on right back base of skull led to very tiny double click (after a while with nose and other facial muscles up). Have felt much better. Although now worried that I overplayed animal crossing because I was so comfortable and that is why the right back neck (45 degrees) feels like it's now swelling up / going numb. My left shoulder is also up although I've been trying to adjust the rib downward. 

Need to either DMSO the right back of neck (after cleaning) or painkiller it.
