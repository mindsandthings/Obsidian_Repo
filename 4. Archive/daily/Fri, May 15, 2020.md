Pretty achy today, especially hip. I think I've got it now, after finding a spot underneath my rib cage on the right. My thumbs are tingling now though. 

It seems like these exercises are causing a lot of nerve issues, and I don't know why. (Although I suppose that packing and looking down is also playing a role.)
