The core tenet of Stupidism is that everyone is really hecking stupid.
The core values of Stupidism are
* **Caution**: because we, being stupid and surrounded by stupid people, are liable to do something stupid or be subjected to the stupidity of others at any time and in any situation.
* **Compassion**: because it sucks to be stupid, and we are all stupid together.
* **Curiosity**: because being stupid means having a lot to learn.
