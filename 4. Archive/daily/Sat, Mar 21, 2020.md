Woke up pretty thoroughly achy. Lowering right shoulder for a while and then cameling caused right mid-lower-back to pop which helped.

Muldowney protocol exercises seem to be helping; it's noticeable on walks and also in general with respect to lower back stability. (Of course, I'm also not writing much, which may affect it.)
