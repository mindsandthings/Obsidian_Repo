Woke up a bit achy but nonetheless got up from breakfast at 7:50. Did all exercises. 

Afternoon - head not feeling superfull but feeling very stupid and unmotivated. holding head in draining position helped. So I took an eighth of an acetazolamide at 4:07 pm. 

Last night I'd had some salty tofu. 

Also I watched Community all day. 

4:36 draining but it doesn't feel great. I still want to lie down.
