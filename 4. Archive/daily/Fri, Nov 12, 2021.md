Coughed a little yesterday during some things. Last night had that one spot in my throat itch terribly and suddenly, and had to get up and have water and food due to coughing/chocking. 

Cramps and badly aching lower back. Took ibuprofen and put on voltearen gel; not making much of a dent.

Just want to lose myself in things. 

Last night played VR. Don't know if related to anything today. 

Everything not dissociative feels impossible. 

We are some shrimp soup with peppers in it last night. Related? 

Took 1/2 tab famotidine to see if it helped with cramping.
