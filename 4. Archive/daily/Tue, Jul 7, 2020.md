Pain management for today? nerve glides

Woke up super ouchy and floppy. Breasts have been hurting for several days; don't know if it is period or if it is muscle growth. 

Very weak on some upper-body exercises (TYI especially). Don't know if it is from not having enough food and protein, not having exercised regularly several days in a row, nerve entrapment, or something else.
