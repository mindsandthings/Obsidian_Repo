Acetazolamide? n

Clonazepam? y
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today?

Last night was in incredible pain all over and felt awful - acetazolamide helped with head stuffy feeling but made it feel pressure too low. Garlic smell in bedroom from having had windows open was bad. May have been combo of thing between shoulders out + right hip very achy from all the band exercises + post-headache. Today I have had ibuprofen and put the thing in my back back into place, and rested. Very late start though.
