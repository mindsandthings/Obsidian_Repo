Went to bed on time?  n, late

Clonazepam last night? n

Acetazolamide? n

Pain management for today? 

Woke up and bent back of neck out to the right and it cracked and stuff got much better. Lay in bed for a while relaxing.

Exercised pretty hard. Left side of face/head feels numb/swollen-ish but overall I feel like I can sit up straight comfortably again. I thought the problem was in my mid-back but I guess it was the back of the neck thing.
