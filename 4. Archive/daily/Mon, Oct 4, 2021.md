Instructor in Death Valley + glasses didn't show up

ASL class 9-12am; ASL lab with Daniella and Kendra; 2 hrs Slay the Spire; no Deaf History class because instructor in Death Valley. 

My glasses came to the neighborhood....then left, because City Optometry didn't put my house number in the address. I called (right away! go me!) and they are going to rush mail it after it  gets returned. I don't know how long it will take to get returned; I'm hoping overnight. 

Facebook major outage today, and I'm hearing their building was locked too, which is worrisome. Somebody apparently just deleted the DNS records? 

I figured out how to set up the ASL DVD to play for Daniella and Kendra over zoom. I already did unit 7 but at least it will handle my lab hours. 

Face muscles frequently ouchy from chewing on chewies. Have been doing trps.
