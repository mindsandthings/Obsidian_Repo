Yesterday only had ibuprofen in morning. Was fine throughout day and then at bed time got worse and worse. Today feel a little shaky and melty. Can't remember if I had ibuprofen with breakfast but will take at lunch. 

Also, head muscles were tense from chewing on chewy. Need to remember to work with those even if it doesn't feel necessary. 

System: went for walk last night and visualized headspace's all areas while existing in reality. Felt calmer and people were excited about it. 

New aligner today.
