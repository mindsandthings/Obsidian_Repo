# COming year notes 2021

Coming year
*Asterisked items need a soon deadline
*List out options for keeping ASL up and pick some
Writing: plan to decide whether to continue and how
Bass: continue till end of Feb. Then decide if getting a new teacher. 
Gardening: let it drop off. Not sure what to do with supplies; hang onto just in case? Since if Ana is not involved I may get interested in small-scale gardening again.
VR art: keep doing for a while and reevaluate if I want to keep doing it. Might be good to focus on it as a way to do things I enjoy or find fulfilling, rather than a way to show things off to others. I might want to list out things I want to learn though, like importing others' sketches.
