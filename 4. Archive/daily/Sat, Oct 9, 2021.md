Frustrated because glasses still not here.

Took Maya to halloween house in neighborhood again, she pointed at stuff and I named it for her. She noticed birds and notices them in the sky now, along with trees. She picked up pine needles and I explained they comes from trees and showed her a tree with lots of pine needles. 

Lots of abdominal cramping. Took ibuprofen again.
