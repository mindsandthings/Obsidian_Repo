No Slay the Spire; slept well

Lots of eye patch yesterday, slept well woke up 6:30 felt good. Achy now though. also, I think restaurant food gives me indigestion after I eat, now that I don't take famotidine for the mestinon. 

Wrote Deaf History paper yesterday afternoon but am waiting to submit it until I can think about it. 

A little worried that right incisor is not coming down correctly. Chewies seem to help though so maybe I just need more attention on those. 

Lower abdominal cramping starting I think. Looks like it's the middle of my cycle almost exactly. Will take ibuprofen.
