Went to bed on time? y

Clonazepam last night? y

Acetazolamide? n

Pain management for today? nerve glides, de quervain's

feeling much better having slept a big chunk even though I woke up at 4:15 and could not get back to sleep.

very difficult TYI exercises even though I did nerve glides beforehand but something must have worked out (probably holding my right chest up straighter) by the time I got to the bands.
