Acetazolamide? 1/8 at 3:45pm
DMSO? yesterday around 4pm
Clonazepam? n
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? y

Pain management for today? 

Yesterday afternoon/evening head felt pretty tight, and it still kind of does today. Right lowest rib also feels out. I'm not 100% convinced that I need acetazolamide - I've done really well, not needing it since the 15th - but I'm keeping it on hand in case. 

Sinuses felt more and more dry and inflated over the day. acetazolamide didn't make the head pressure/dry thing go away. I think it's maybe vasoconstriction. (It did start going away when I lay down on my front for a bit)
