Took 1/8 acetazolamide at 8:08, by 9:26 post-exercise was feeling way better and then pushed neck back into place - twisting left middle to the right - and now I can sit up straight again. 

This might be why it was doing so much worrying grinding when I was doing nerve glides. 

yesterday had 2 servings of tater tots, think it was probably way too much salt
