Woke up achy again (breastbone level of back and pelvis). Stretched; feels better but right neck hurts. 

Bluhhh. 


Head began feeling very tight last night. Wonder if this is a CSF thing again. If it persists after exercises I'll take an eighth of an acetazolamide. 

Interesting that it's preceded by feeling frantic and having difficulty sleeping. 

tok 1/7 azetolamide but alo clicked a thing in neck at right back by pusing in and left

head continues to feel really achy and stuffed and not good.

also possible: is this a side effect of eating a bunch of salt last night?
