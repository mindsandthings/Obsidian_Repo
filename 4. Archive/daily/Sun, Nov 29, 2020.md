Acetazolamide? n
DMSO? y, incl lower back and hips night before
Clonazepam? 
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today? 

I have new muscles accessible in my neck/head that help! Like the swallowing ones at the back of my nose that hold something down and away. May relate to getting magnesium up in hair when DMSO last night. 

I did feel pretty congested after walk. don't know if from motion or from outside. 

didn't feel awesome waking up (weak, dizzy, leg flop) but have been getting things done fairly well.
