Wound up taking ibuprofen last night due to worry I wouldn't be able to sleep. 

Achy this morning but could also get going easily. 

Very difficult time with the yellow-band exercises and the Y of the TYI. Think this might be due to nerve stuff not muscle stuff. 

This was the day the traumatizing thing with the disability team happened.

14:00 trying taking 1/8 acetazlamide.
~2:25: pressure on head and neck is easing, even though I didn't think it was pressure just soreness
