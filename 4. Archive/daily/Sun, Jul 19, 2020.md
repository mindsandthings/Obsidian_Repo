Acetazolamide? y, 1/8 + 1/4

Clonazepam? y
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? n

Pain management for today? nerve glides, de quervains


awake late because of cooking under bright light sand couldn't sleep. head tight/swollen all over all day yesterday. woke up feeling awful and could not get going. 

acetazolamide didn't seem to kick in well until I was actively upright. 

arms were very weak for I's and Y's for exercises, so I switched and did ball exercises instead.
