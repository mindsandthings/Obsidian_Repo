Bluhhhh tired. Was achy waking up, probably from yesterday (have gone down on mestinon due to needing refills)

Chiro said that I was only half a degree off this time (he might have meant only for one thing? but overall it's still apparently better)

Feeling a bit head-stuffy/swollen after the adjustment but still pretty good.
