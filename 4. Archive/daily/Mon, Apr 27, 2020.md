Feel pretty good today. Have woken up from dreams feeling good a few times recently, and this time it's stayed for a while.

Gently moving back and forth the stuck-feeling parts like I'm gliding the nerve seems to be very effective, though I suspect most of the improvement is related to the exercise. Tomorrow is my last day of this level.
