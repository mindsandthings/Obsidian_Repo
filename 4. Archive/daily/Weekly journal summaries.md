# Weekly journal summaries

## 2021-11-13 through 2021-11-20

Week of period. Cramping started the previous week on Tuesday; period started this week Tuesday, but Wed-Thu-Fri were particularly bad days, possibly because I stopped taking ibuprofen after taking it for a week. I also seem to have set my neck out of order - not sure if that was from trying to fix it as a neck issue instead of an abdominal issue, or if it just happened. 

Michael came back into town. 

In therapy, Pasut pushed me to view judgmental parts as making it hard for other parts to come out. I'm inferring that she thinks my cooperative relationship with judgmental parts is interfering with therapy. 

Singleted all week.
