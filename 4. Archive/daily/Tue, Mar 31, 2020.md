Achy on left shoulder side, which feels raised. Right back of neck feels tensed.
Pushed down on left trap and got a couple pops.
 
Yesterday noticed swollen spot on left 3rd toe has been getting worse. Am trying not wearing stockings or a sock on it today. Also put voltaren on it last night and this morning. 

Shoulder/neck nerve (right side - maybe caused by bass playing?) got really painfully stuck last night after walk. Nerve glides helped it relax finally.
