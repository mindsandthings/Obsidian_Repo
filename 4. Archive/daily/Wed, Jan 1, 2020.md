The back of my skull has felt very stuck. And I've had cramping problems from too much fun. 

I also feel tired and depressed and want to die. 

Obviously because I read about climate change.

I am angry about this. That all things seem to be my fault. That I have learned that I need to pre-sabotage to keep others happy.
