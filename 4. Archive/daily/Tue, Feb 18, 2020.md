Slept very badly last night, lots of nightmares, woke up solidly at least 2 times. (2:30, 4:30)

Achy today. Esp left neck. May have had to do with salt from ramen - if I do that again I need to make sure to have a lot of water and some potassium.

Had some potassium again just now and it helped.

Standing up seems to be fine. Wonder if that's related.
