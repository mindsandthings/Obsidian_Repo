Woke up pretty ouch  even though I took ibuprofen again last night. also very head foggy hard to wake up. michael had done blackout curtain stuff again.

arm shoulder area feeling increasingly strong though. 

head feels tight and stuffy; don't know if it's needing draining or just that I am dehydrated and have been doing TMJ exercises.

also last nightL: not eating for a long time and then eating seems to give me ehadaches. and precipitate needing to take acetazolamide.
