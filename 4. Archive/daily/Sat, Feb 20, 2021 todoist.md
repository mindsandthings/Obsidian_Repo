	* 

Remember not to make suggestions or have opinions about how groups operate, especially when there are people from marginalized groups involved. Do not volunteer to do things; do not contribute more than the minimum; do not step in; do not be visible. If someone in power invites you to, distrust them, especially if it seems like they have the power to grant it. Your goal is to be one of the faceless masses. Your fawn response actively endangers you. Your cooperation response actively endangers you. Your instinct to connect actively endangers you.

Tomorrow

	* 

never EVER EVER do that again. NEVER. do not try to suggest anything restricting anyone from a minority group

Thursday

	* 

DO NOT BLOG. DO NOT WRITE ON TUMBLR. DO NOT TALK ABOUT IT.

Tomorrow

STOP WINNING THINGS. STOP COMPETING. STOP SHOWING OFF. STOP STANDING OUT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THOSE THINGS. THEY WILL ALIENATE OTHER PEOPLE AND YOU WILL BE A BAD PERSON.

Tomorrow

I need a policy of ZERO responses to critique. The only response is to say "thanks, that's very helpful." I can follow up later by email if I have to, but I don't owe them an explanation. they're nothing to me.

Tomorrow

	* 

STOP SUGGESTING STUFF

Tomorrow

	* 

I am *only* in this group for what I can get for it for the novel. Not for the people.

Tomorrow

	* 

maybe I don't have to do anything about self-esteem. maybe that really doesn't matter, because these people aren't worth my maintaining a relationship with them. they're not worth my respect. maybe they're just where I am right now before I move on to something else.

Tomorrow

Tuesday

	* 

Change wax guards

Aug 17

	*

Tuesday

	* 

Stop sharing personal distress stuff about autism. Stop doing in Slack and stop doing it in the novel and in the footnotes. It suggests that you are competing for status as a marginalized person and trying to use trauma to get out of punishment. It also makes the whole place less comfortable to be.

Tomorrow

	* 

Send chapters to beta-readers and sensitivity readers

Wednesday

	* 

remember: people don't want something that will help them. they want to feel like the things they post and say help you.

Saturday

	* 

M is a bully whom you have seen bully people before; you are not obligated to take her in good faith. When she agresses, say: "I'm not sure that sits completely right with me. I'll think about it and get back to you." PQ generally: Remember, hon, they're kind of intolerant, and they receive points for weaponizing the framework against you in order to appear more victimized. There are good people in there, but the framework has set up being a good person in a way that can harm you.

Mar 10

	* 

when michael says he feels like he should be doing something special or creative for volunteering, help him think about what he could do, instead of talking him down
