Acetazolamide? y, 1/8 at noon

Clonazepam? n
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today?

Dehydrated yesterday, and major stress and driving in evening. Today woke up, ouch esp low/middle back. Feels a little better but head feels full. Drinking a lot of water and going to use DMSO *but* what to do about hair? I want to bleach it and dye it but then I have to not use DMSO for multiple washings. 

Drains when I hold my neck up in front. Still feels tight.
