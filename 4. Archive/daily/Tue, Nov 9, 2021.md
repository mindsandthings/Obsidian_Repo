Got covid booster shot. 

Woke up ok-ish, back a little out, then spent like 2 hours on the floor. May have been partly a bit at top of neck that got out, partly forgetting(?) my low dose of atenolol last night, partly yesterday's shutting left eye periodically to relax the sensation in my right back of neck - could have tired me out. 

Listening to pink noise on speakers; it does seem to help straighten head again. 

Celeste said again this morning that she didn't throw the sushi into the recycling bin, and claimed it was Eric, after yesterday asking if it could have been Ana and then deciding it couldn't have been. I told her "I'll have to talk to Eric then" but it didn't sound very convincing because 1) I don't want to talk to her about it more and 2) Eric doesn't clean out the fridge, and he knows that the recycling is for recycling, and there is *a sign* on the recycling saying not to put food in it. I have not pointed out to Celeste that it isn't about the sushi, it's about multiple instances of finding food and garbage in the recycling. 

Last night I tried to classify head mates into tendencies again and today I got depressed passive influence that didn't let up until I affirmed they were persons again. I do not know what's going on with me; it seems to change from day to day. Recently I thought I was definitely integrated-ish, but now I seem to be narrowed/cut off again. These seem to be cycles of working hard to get in touch and then just kind of forgetting about it, often involving difficulty contacting people in the middle.

Have been exploring the possibility of polyfragmentation, as a possibility for why we have trouble reaching the "real one" sometimes. It's hard for me to understand, like, how that could possibly be; a lot of polyfrag system seem to be able to easily name and identify their fragments. I think we were looking into layers as kind of restarts of the system after switching situations. Which would imply that maybe we're...I don't know.

I think we . ok, I just completely forgot what I was thinking a ou

right, it was about approach parts / ones that get us in trouble as adults. 
can we contact them and assure them it's okay to let go? that we don't have to desperately affiliate anymore.
except that's not listening to them. that's not addressing their actual problems. it's an overruling, top down from above thing. and we can't bring it up in therapy because we'll get "the problem is that you're being judgmental" except, no, the problem is literally that approach parts set the whole thing off. they respond to perceptions of social danger by going in the opposite direction. it's not a threat of negligence! the negligence will happen no matter what! the negligence cannot be eliminated by inviting abuse! you! are! helpless! 

and the only way we know, again, to address the approach parts is via counteracting them with persecutor and passive toleration parts. we don't know how to get the approach parts what they want! not in the external world! the idea seems to be that we get them to reattach to *us* but that honestly seems really fucking dangerous because we don't have everything they want because our "parenting" parts don't exist! we can't take that kind of hungry attachment because it's bottomless! it wants something that is literally fake because it was only d
