Last night felt pretty sick after dinner - wonder if it wa related to mushrooms.

Today achy esp right side of neck/head, exercise helped some. Now took 3 ibuprofen in case it's period related or some kind of general inflammation thing. 

Also clicked neck back into place a couple different ways and not sure if it's helping or making worse.
