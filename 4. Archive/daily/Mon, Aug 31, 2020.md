Acetazolamide? y, 1/8 in trying to see if I can avoid 1/4 and big swings

Clonazepam? y, just needed to fucking sleep and wasn't ramping down
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? y

Pain management for today? 


Continuing to hold up nose seems to help. 

DMSO'd nasal passage after feeling swollen / very stuffy and the left one hurting. I've also put voltaren gel on the back of my head both last night and this morning due to feeling so bad.
