Pain management for today? 


Tired. 

Reset Animal Crossing last night and then big stress from naming/choosing new name and setup. 

Today, played a long time. 

Also, head feeling congested again but can't use DMSO on it because of the ketoconazole shampoo, which I need to not thoroughly wash off - thought I may decide to soap it off, apply DMSO, and put the ketoconazole stuff back on later on. 

I do still feel overall pretty good. 

Dehydrated though.
