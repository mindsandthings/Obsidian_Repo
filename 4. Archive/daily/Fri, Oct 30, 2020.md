Pain management for today? 

*The right lower sternum rib out and right hip going out thing had a common cause: something in my neck that went back in, like a double click on the right side. Not a rotation exactly, I don't think I know how to replicate it. 

I feel like I've found a new neck muscle to tense to make things better. It's sort of a central inside peninsula.
