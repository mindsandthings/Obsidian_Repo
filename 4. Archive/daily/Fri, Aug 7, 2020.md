Acetazolamide? n

Clonazepam? n
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today?

Up quite late due to inability to fall asleep comfortably. I think all the cabinet organizing I did yesterday with arms above my head and looking up was the problem, like before. 

Dehydrated. Head kind of full; hoping I can improve it with posture. 

Also used DMSO on back of neck and temples. Think it did result in everything feeling open.
