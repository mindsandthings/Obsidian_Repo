Achy when I got up, last night was achy trying to go to sleep. Back of head does feel a little swollen. I was very dehydrated yesterday from not drinking water and my schedule being messed up, and also I ate some pretty salty stuff. Not great.

Difficulty sleeping because of mid-upper-back/shoulder issues.
