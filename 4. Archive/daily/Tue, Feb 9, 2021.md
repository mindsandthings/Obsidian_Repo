Acetazolamide? n
DMSO? y
Clonazepam? n
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today? 


Yesterday did a particularly intense trigger point release for the front collarbones one, followed by DMSO at night. It seems to have been pretty effective! 

Also this morningI figured out how to tense a muscle below my right shoulder that rotates it up/back and that has a direct and immediate effect on how good i feel. 

After cleaning toilet, abdominal muscles cramping (??).
