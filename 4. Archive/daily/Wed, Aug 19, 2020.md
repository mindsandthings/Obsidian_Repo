Acetazolamide? n

Clonazepam? n
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? y

Pain management for today?

Today I figured out my hips issue, with the clenching mid-right-back: top of torso needs to go directly to the side and up, bottom needs to go directly to the side and down. That's fixed now.

I tried nasal rinse with a small bit of DMSO and I think it did help with the pain in my left sinus.
