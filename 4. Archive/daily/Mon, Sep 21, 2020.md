Acetazolamide? n

Clonazepam? y
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today?

Took meds at 10:10 instead of 9:50. Couldn't fall asleep. While lying in bed awake/dreaming believed I was Kathryn from Aphelion. Finally took clonazepam, maybe after that, maybe before. Slept all the way until alarm and was drowsy waking up. 

Lower right hip-back. Was worse last night. 

Did fairly strong craniocervical exercises this morning and am getting inflammation feelings. (I already had aches/stuck which I managed to mostly unstick.)
