Clonazepam? n
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? y

Pain management for today? TOS

Have been putting left first rib back into place regularly. Right second rib is harder - it went in definitely that one time, not sure it's meaningfully gone in since, but even just pushing down manually seems to be helpful. 

Have also been doing trigger points in those muscles. Seems to be getting easier to figure out which ones are needed. 

Had parmesan last night, with 1 lactase. Mildly uncomfortable insides this morning but not that bad? Last night I was in some pain all over but don't know if related. 

Remembering to raise nose etc is very helpful. Wonder if I could find more exercises for those muscles.
