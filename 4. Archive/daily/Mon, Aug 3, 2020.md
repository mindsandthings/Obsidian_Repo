Acetazolamide? n

Clonazepam? n
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? y, and slept on back most of night

Pain management for today? sit up!


Yesterday DMSO'd chest. Attempted to sleep on back; mostly worked. Felt like throat was collapsed slightly but drainage seemed better. Woke up feeling more present and less fuzzy than in a long time. 

Morning sitting up at table instead of on floor.
