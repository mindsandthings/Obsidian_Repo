Did some TRPs on walk in an attempt to address current mild headache. Put volteran gel on face this morning and on chest now. Wish there was someone who could make sense of this for me. Can work, but feeling overall tired. 

Don't know what exactly to do. Just ugh bluh. Caffeine maybe? Will try with lunch. 

Working on Madison scene todya. Worried.
