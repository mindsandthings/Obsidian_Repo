Acetazolamide? n

Clonazepam? y
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today?

I think the old melatonin I took out of my purse might be half of a 1mg, not half of a 3mg. so I will change that tonight. 

Tried hard to drink adequate water yesterday. Head feels stuffy and full now. Have been debating whether I should take more since I last took it only 3 days ago. I have had a pattern of taking it twice recently. 


Problem was at least partly my lower jaw / front of neck not being relaxed and moved down and forward.
