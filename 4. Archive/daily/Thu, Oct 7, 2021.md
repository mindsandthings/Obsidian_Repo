Michael's home, Allie's isolating

I played Slay the Spire again last night and had some predictable difficulty getting to sleep. I'm hoping that'll even out now. 

I curved my back out to set the left side in this morning, but the right side went out in that one spot that goes out a lot, which is frustrating. 

I think my hair's drying really well today though. Washed it last on Monday; today I did extra conditioner. 

Worried about my right front incisor not dropping into place for invisalign.
