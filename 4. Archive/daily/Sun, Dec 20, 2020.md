Acetazolamide? y, 1/8
DMSO? y, last night
Clonazepam? y
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today? 


have been having clonazepam much more frequently recently. need to start relaxing at night again. 

3:30 definitely having head pressure and need to pee but can't pee enough. Possibly related to:
* car trip last night without head rest and not enough food
* beyond meat sausage
