Tried propping pillows up with towel/blanket under them to get head on straight last night. It seems to have helped then, but I've been very achy today. Including my hip. 

[9:30am] hip just popped, I thought it might need to but it didn't when it normally would have so I wasn't sure. feeling a bit better now.

Emotionally okay except for the usual climate change stuff.
