Continuing to be triggered over holiday presents and specifically over having to tell Ana. and over having to organize it. and over not being able to go downstairs without being made available. 

thing in back went in briefly in middle of night. now out again. low back hurts and I want to sit awkward. on the up side my left shoulder/neck is somewhat better. I thought this was supposed to go away and I am very hurt and disappointed.
