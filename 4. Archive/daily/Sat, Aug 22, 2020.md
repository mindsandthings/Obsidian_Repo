Clonazepam? n
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? n

Pain management for today? 

Today woke up feeling bad, but set back into place by pushing it to the side then pressing up on hips to elongate spine and let it slip back into place. Very head congested today although DMSO helped and being upright helped and exercising helped. 

Kind of exhausted and crappy though.
