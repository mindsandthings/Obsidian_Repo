Neurodivergent publishign program? 
[Introducing our Editors-at-Large and the Multiverse series | Milkweed Editions](https://milkweed.org/blog/introducing-our-editors-at-large-and-the-multiverse-series)
Multiverse is a literary series devoted to different ways of languaging. It primarily emerges from the practices and creativity of neurodivergent, autistic, neuroqueer, and disabled cultures. The hope of Multiverse is to serially surface multiple universes of underheard language that might intersect, resonate, and aggregate toward liberatory futures. In other words, each book in the Multiverse series gestures toward a correspondence–human and more-than-human–that lovingly exceeds what is normal and normative in our society, questioning and augmenting what literary culture is, has been, and can be.
