Got up again for Maya. Woke up once in night and then at 5:47, just before I was intending to get up. Dropped atenolol from 1/2 to 0 and dropped lyrica. I'm completely off both now. We'll see how the week goes.

The glasses continue to be good. I can tell my eyes are achier with the close up work but I can see so much intensely better for all things. I had an episode of feeling wiped after taking care of Maya and carrying her around this morning, felt like the back of my head was stiff, but now I feel ok again.

Doing a bunch of stuff today including schoolwork. It's Halloween and we're taking Maya trick or treating tonight.
