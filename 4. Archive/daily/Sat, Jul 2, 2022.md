Today I am panicking over the potassium meter inquiry and getting yelled at. I honestly do not know how I can get through this in a way that isn't awful. I would like to simply withdraw the posting. 

I'm exhausted and just want to lie back down. 

I have to spend all afternoon doing games stuff with Michael having fun. 

Went for a walk yesterday, knees started hurting

Took ibuprofen 10am
