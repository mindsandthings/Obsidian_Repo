Back of head very achy - had chiro yesterday but probably more of an issue because of scootering there and back. Have put it back in in a couple ways. Feels like my head slid forward don my spine (chin forward, forehead back). 

Forgot to do Muldowney protocol exercises yesterday. Going to start doing them earlier in the day.
