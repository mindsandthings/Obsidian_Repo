Wiggled sphenoid bone, felt much better. So weird. I think the problem really is where the bones come together in my head. THey are probably off from past pressure from teh inside and from holding my head tilted. 

M's bday tomorrow. Yesterday did meeting re escape game, worked on it. 

Also did some TMJ stuff from this channel

Hugely helpful. Maybe if I do more of that I can get the rest of my head/face/neck pain
