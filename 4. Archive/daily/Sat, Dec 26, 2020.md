Acetazolamide? n
DMSO? n
Clonazepam? 
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today? 

Did not record the last two days. 
Last night I finally got something in my head to go into place and my head is on straight again I think?? It feels like it hasn't felt in months. It's a bit tight and there were some times when it felt it was filling up, especially 4-5 hours after an adjustment just like with the atlas adjustments in San Francisco. But it didn't get too bad and it's reduce the pain a lot. 

I might have used a clonazepam once in the last few nights? Not sure.

Did figure out Wed pm that Michael and I are both having athlete's foot problems. My feet had been itching/tingling a bit but they do that anyway and I'd been wondering why it was worse than usual. Think I got it in crotch and hands too. Plus a big pimple in my butt crack, wheee. Put antibiotic on that, clo-?? on my crotch, and the other stuff on my feet and hands. Washing and then doing that twice a day. Has helped dramatically. 

Did not wear compression stockings yesterday and am not wearing them today (due to athlete's foot, want more breathability). It was a bit tough yesterday but doesn't seem to have much effect today??
