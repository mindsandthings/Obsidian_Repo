Stretched right side toward left by leaning on chair, then popped back into place; it was clearly what was out and causing me to feel so bad last night. It was completely in for a bit, which was nice, then seems to have gone out again.

Doing the junior Birman nerve glide seems to have fixed the problem with the internal rotations , but I couldn't do the external ones for the full time. 

Doing the wall press nerve glides, with hand up and then again with hand down, seems to fix that. 

Let's go see about triceps.
