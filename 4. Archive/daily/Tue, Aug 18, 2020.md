Acetazolamide? y, 1/4

Clonazepam? n
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? n - baby

Pain management for today? usual

Tdap booster yesterday, arm achy, feel kind of out of it today. Did not exercise because too achy. 

I feel pretty terrible today. Could be Tdap, or bumping up exercise level yesterday, ro both. I know my back was out a lot and that I was super stressed yesterday.

Also ate tomatoes. Possible nightshade issue?
