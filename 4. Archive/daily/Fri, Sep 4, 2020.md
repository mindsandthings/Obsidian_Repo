Acetazolamide? n

Clonazepam?n
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? y

Pain management for today?


Last night slept in hard neck brace. Did not have the pre-sleep intense anxiety like normal. Have felt (the good kind of) drained this morning and not in much discomfort. 

Took yesterday off from upper body exercises. Lower back is bugging me a lot though.
