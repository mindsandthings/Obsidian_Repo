Feeling a bit better lower back. Possibly because right side of neck got stretched/let go a bit. Experimenting with manually aligning horizontal lines to look horizontal. seems to tilt my head left which may not be the best way to do it. 

Lower back still not great though. 

Woke up 2x last night.
