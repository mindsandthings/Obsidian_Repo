Last night did something to low back. Hurts badly and seizes up if I bend over. But, rest of back and head aren't a problem. 

Took ibuprofen last night and again this morning. 

Maya seems to really want away from Ana and with me and I feel bad for her. I think Ana is pushing more and more for compliance. 

I really really do not want to call City Optometry and may not do it.
