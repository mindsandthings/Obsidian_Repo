i’ve started replacing “i want to die” with “i feel overwhelmed” in my internal monologue, which is usually more accurate and more productive 

ive been working on replacing ‘im so stupid’ with ‘im so silly’ and it has the same effect!
“I can’t do this” -> This will be a challenge for me, it’s normal to feel intimidated
“I hate this” -> This is a tough situation to handle and I’m doing my best
“I hate myself” -> I’m struggling with low self esteem right now, I need to support myself as I would a friend
“I can’t believe I forgot again” -> It’s tough to balance so many things, maybe I need to let go of some of them
“They’re not going to like me” -> I don’t have to perform for anyone, my personality is valid and loveable just as is
The list could go on and on…
Redirecting the “blame” from yourself and recognizing that you are a human suffering through normal, difficult human experiences is important. Support yourself like you’d support any of your close friends if they said these things.
I can’t tell you how delighted I am to see Actual Scripted Examples!
I’ve known I need to modify my self-talk like this for three+ years, and I’ve been *trying* for that long, but I never know what to replace it with. So the examples are super incredibly helpful, thank you so much. ~<333
