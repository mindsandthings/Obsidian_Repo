Mildly achy. Yesterday after 1 salty meal noticed more headache and more after a second. This morning took 1/8 acetazolamide and am feeling drain-y but not achy anymore. 

I also noticed yesterday a lot of chest tightness with specific trigger points, probably related to exercising Muldowney upper body more.
