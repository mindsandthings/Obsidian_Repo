Acetazolamide? n
DMSO? n
Clonazepam? y
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? y

Pain management for today? 

Went to bed but just...didn't fall asleep. Maybe due to forgetting to take meds for an hour last night? idk.

Used the clotrimazole last night and this morning. Think it may be working better than the ketoconazole. 

Intensive work on those two trigger points near center collarbone seems to have made the back of my skull surprisingly comfortable. 

Muldowney uppers seems to have activate trigger points a little further out.
