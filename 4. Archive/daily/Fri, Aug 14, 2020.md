Acetazolamide? n

Clonazepam? n
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? y

Pain management for today?

Last night I took DMSO before bed right before, and I woke up in the morning and the right side of my skull at the base did a little separating thing and it is wonderful. I do feel kind of achy and tense from relaxing it and the part I popped might feel a little swollen but otherwise it feels really good.
