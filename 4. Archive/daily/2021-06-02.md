…I really hate seeing people screaming at writers on social media for using the wrong metaphors to express their pain
Some of this stuff seems like it’s not that you’re disallowed from using certain words, it’s that you’re disallowed from having certain feelings. Like the thing where having negative feelings about your own genitals is “transphobic.” There isn’t an Approved Wording that would allow you to have anything less than a relentlessly celebratory view of your genitals.
the thing I’m pissed about is the one where you’re “disallowed” from ever using *anything*that looks like someone else’s pain as a metaphor for your own
like you know that post that keeps going around tumblr that’s like “ex-evangelical kids why do you keep using stained glass and catholic saints to talk about your religious trauma when we all know it looked like this: [series of *extremely triggering*photographs of the inside of fundie churches]”
gee, I don’t know, maybe it’s because stained glass is visually appealing and it’s distant enough from the *actual*sources of ex-fundie religious trauma that we can engage with it? 
like I get that it’s hard to see other people using *your*pain specifically as a metaphor, especially if there’s … y'know, PRIVILEGE DYNAMICS going on… but… for the love of all things cute and fluffy.
I think it’s also an expression of the unfortunately prevalent attitude that the experiences of every particular group are *totally unique* and there’s NO commonality or overlap between different particular traumatic experiences and it’s offensive to use stuff that “belongs” to another group because you’re stealing something from them. And that’s just plain incorrect – a lot of what actually makes different experiences traumatic are broader, more abstract feelings like powerlessness, loss of trust, etc. – and convinces people that the only ones who can *truly* understand their pain is the ones who went through the exact same experiences and fosters this attitude of proprietary trauma that almost inevitably turns into sorting traumatic experiences into a hierarchy rather than a venn diagram.
I think you are correct and it drives me all the way up the wall.
