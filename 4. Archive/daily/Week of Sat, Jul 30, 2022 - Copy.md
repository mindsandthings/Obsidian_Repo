Ate a lot of lemon potato chips yesterday and played a lot of isaac. Horrible cramping while trying to go to sleep. I am definitely in a loop of distract, feel bad, distract, and I don't want to get out of it.

\[undated\]

Goal: to avoid getting stuck and overwhelmed by task build-up

Tasks I'm having trouble making progress on:

\-\- Vision therapy

\-\- Feldenkrais

\-\- Fanfic

\-\- Pacing/gaming less

\-\- EBT

Largely because I either don't have energy for them, or I only have energy when it would allow me to procrastinate on something else.

Reserve 20 minutes each day to sort through projects, plans and ideas, and goals and strategies for achieving them. Use this time to gather information on options, assess different situations or solidify choices you need to make. Strategic: Always have at least three options in mind so you can adapt if circumstances change.: \*\*\*the problem with this is that it gets overwhelming very fast\*\*\*

What does it \*mean\* to always have three options available? How about instead I just try to notice if I'm getting distressed about something and then come up with additional options?

\-\-\-\-\-

Better to think of EBT stuff as allowing multiple parts to be heard from

I think the EBT focus on "just make yourself feel better" independent of how your emotions function in the world is ultimately not helping me

but also like my emotional brain gives me different numbers from what I experience and I don't know what to do about that within the framework of EBT

and sometimes the actual exercises done from the emotional brain don't seem to be coherent

like, I might feel better but it makes no sense to me

but maybe do them anyway? emotional brain says yes

\*\*Pacing activities: what I've been doing is overdoing it and shutting my brain off at the end of the day. Maybe I could trade off cognitive, physical, and emotional tasks? Pay attention to kind of task and try to vary what I do next more often, rather than grouping all together? \*\*

Nothing in particular to say. Slept thoroughly and well; woke up early and with energy.

Feeling a little better today. Sara sent comments on the outline that are super helpful. I also took action on figuring out vision therapy next steps, and it made me feel much less stuck on everythign just in general. I don't think I realized it was backed up behidn that.

Lots of pain mgt, seems helpful. Continuing to feel more unstuck. Talking about book with Sara and Michael has been really helpful.

Worried about probability that indexing is not a feasible career and iwll only get sworse. I'm going to try to research potential niches, but am worried I won't be able to tell until I'm in the game.

Last night on the walk I walked about worries about job feasibility. Then Michael started gradually going more and more for emotional support but not saying what he wanted. I was feeling really distressed. Then he said he realized he didn't say what he wanted or introduce it—but he seemed in saying that to be resenting me for having placed that expectation on him. I said to tell me what he wanted \[because I was starting to dissociate and feel awful and needed that orientation\]. He said he wanted me to acknowledge that it was happening and to tell him I understood (?) sympathized (?) with him. Then he said "can you do that? can you undersatnd?" and it felt super manipulative and resentful and like there was no other choice and I said I understood and tried to simulate understanding even though I was panicked and dissociated. And then I walked away. I didn't talk to him again and I didn't tell him I was getting ready for bed or wish him good night.

I've been thinking today about what to say to him and what to say in therapy, given that neither Mario nor Michael have been willing to acknowledge or work with what's going on for me. I can't trust him to not overwhelm me if he overrides what I've said I need even during the practice period. It also concerns me that there are so many individual issues with what's going on. I don't want to delve into endless explaining. I don't want to process, I don't want to try to get things across, I want to know that we can create an environment for me to push my own limits and that he won't sabotage those safety measures.
