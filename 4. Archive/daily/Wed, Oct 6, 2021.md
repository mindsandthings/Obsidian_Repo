Talked with therapist, explained the having too much to do thing (she didn't seem to get it?). Allie isolating due to sore throat; I volunteered to watch Maya for 2 hrs in evening.

Lower back went out last night, kinda went back in but then was having problems again. Wound up taking some ibuprofen. 

Lab with Kendra and Luis (both Deaf students). They offered to help me; I wasn't sure if they needed to watch the videos (it seemed last week like Kendra wanted to) so I put them on fast, but I didn't think I needed them badly enough to justify so we watched movies instead. 

I didn't really understand their informal signing! It was frustrating for them and for me, I think. They relaxed outside of class but might not have been noticing they were relaxing. 

Therapy today with therapist and feel like I have to go over the same NT misunderstandings. Not sure to what extent she believes me vs writing these off as false beliefs.
