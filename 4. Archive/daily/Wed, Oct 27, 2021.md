Yesterday was very triggering with Ana decorating for Allie's birthday and asking me to hang a couple things but then what she wanted me to hang expanded and expanded. And she put up printouts like they'd come from other people (Maya, which I guess was culturally ok), Celeste, us, and a weird-ass decoration of love from Eric that he wasn't consulted or asked about although after I expressed concern and then didn't come down for lunch she didn't put them up. But at first when I expressed concern and suggested she check with him she said no, she does this all the time for friends. 

Her issues. But it was still very upsetting because of the putting word sin other people's mouths and the expanding the task and the many cheap trashy disposable decorations. 

I did find some trigger points in jaw near teeth and worked with them a long time and also did DMSO with magnesium spray and feel a lot better physically today. But I still feel kinda emotionally hung over.
