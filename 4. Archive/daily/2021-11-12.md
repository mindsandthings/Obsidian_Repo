Two of the three classes I can take next semester are only offered in person. Ohlone's vaccination policy requires everyone who will be on campus to either show proof of vaccine or have a religious or health exemption. I haven't found information on frequency of exemptions. 

In January, they are eliminating the social distancing requirement. They're keeping other safety protocols, including mandating "cloth face coverings" (including, unfortunately, allowing bandanas and scarves), hand washing, and sanitizing supplies.
