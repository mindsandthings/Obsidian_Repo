Saturday Therapy:

Michael reports on therapist search etc.

IFS Therapy = Steven Universe

Michael and community and that's the main thing that would make me comfortable being in a place indefinitely. Everything else actually ended up on the nice-to-have list

Options for community in M's mind are Austin, Berkeley, maybe Boston. But haven't done a ton of work to develop community here and could be doing it even before ending isolation

e: if we move anywhere, would want to first know what m's plan is for working on community

Options for finding commuity when everyone has kids incl DMing, YRUU,

M: I think some of my ambivalence about the relationship is also about whether I can have the kind of community I want

E: Some of my ambivalence is about when you've had communities like that and sided with them over me

M: I understand that and think I can avoid that mistake again; please help me if I don't seem to be noticing the pattern

Next time, talk more about that. What would help? Rehearsing? A plan/contract?
