# Allie mom discussion notes
We're not going to refuse but we want to have a talk about alternatives and potential concerns before you make a decision. If you decide you do want to have her move in, we have a number of things we want to talk about with respect to how that will work. 

We would like you to consider putting her on the lease. 

Alternatives (we want to hear what you've thought of, and share soem stuff you may not have thought of, but not go into implementation details right now)
Hire administrative support to help with getting prescription worked out
Technology (not app) for meds, like a locked medication dispenser with alarms that notifies you or a service if a dose is skipped
https://medqpillbox.com/medication-reminders-for-dementia-patients/ (locked medication dispenser with an alarm)

https://safetylinemedicalalertsystems.com/medication-dispenser/ (connects to a service)

A home health care worker
Celeste spends most of the day here but sleeps there. Someone (possibly hired) shuttles her over and back.
Phone call check-ins with a hired person to monitor meds
Speech therapy for cognitive decline or coming up with other environmental solutions
A two-bedroom


Concerns
Maya's room would mean stairs/falls

If you put Maya in your room, she's likely to wake up often, and you're both likely to wake up often

What happens if she moves in and they find out she has significantly more support needs than they were aware of, or if she develops a lot of new ones? What about if she does that and it turns out her dad has support needs ehr mom was meeting?

I want you to consider the time and space to take on eldercare in addition to a baby and a dog and full-time jobs and looking for a house? 

What has Bob said?

What are their needs in the future - 

How
Boundaries around what I'm expected to do re eldercare - like if I know she's forgetting medication do I just let her do it
How rapidly are her mother's cognitive issues getting worse?
How much time will her dad also be over here?
When would she move in?
How will Allie set her own boundaries?
1. kitchen access
2. not having to do all the dishes/chores (and specifically, if they're to be shared I need a schedule)
3. 
-- She has to have a room, not the couch
-- She uses your restroom or Bob's, not ours

Elizabeth: 
-- I could just wear headphones when going downstairs
-- I would want to do fewer chores, and to have scheduled times when I can do chores
-- we want to have people stop using the large kitchen island for storage space - we need that for prep space

Michael:
-- we don't want to feel obligated to socialize during the day
-- noise in morning waking up is bad but doesn't want to do anything about it
