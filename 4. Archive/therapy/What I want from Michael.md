# What I want from Michael


What I want from Michael:
1) general area
2) projection about how long you thinks it will last
3) helpful to know if you have plans for mitigation
4) if it's an ongoing thing, it helps to know you're aware it's an ongoing thing
5) what you think you might need (e.g. to be left alone and for how long; any help you might want from me)

Not: rapid-speaking mumbly panic voice

1) to know that he's not upset at me, but not if he's going to say that accusatorially
