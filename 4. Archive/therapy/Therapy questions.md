# Therapy questions

I am a writer
I'm working on a novel
I'm autistic and one of the characters is autistic

I had a lot of emotional issues come up for me surrounding critiquing 
and I know they're likely to come up even more strongly when I'm trying to get an agent and trying to sell the book

what approach do you take?
when you set goals with a client, and later you realize 

are you going to continue to offer telehealth after the pandemic is over?


my issues are sometimes less with not understanding why I have a particular reaction to something and more with not being able to change it.
