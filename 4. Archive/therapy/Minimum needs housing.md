My strong preference would be to move somewhere we can stay indefinitely, but I know that's not necessarily possible, so here are my minimum conditions for different lengths of time.

I would be more open to roommates if we owned a place with the intent of staying there long-term, and were renting out a room (or two rooms, or an ADU, or if we lived in an ADU and rented out a house). I don't think I'd want more than 2 adult roommates, although I'd be ok if they had a kid.

Would be really good
