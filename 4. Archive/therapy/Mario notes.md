***Skip or reschedule Feb 4?

topics:

• the eric and allie misunderstanding

○ "Are you sure" makes it a q about e's judgement, implies she shouldn't be or that she should have been more rigorous or should have been in charge. When possible say why asking or just ask a factual question.

○ It also caused problems bcs I answered her question with a question that wasn't, to her, obviously relevant. In general it would be more thoughtful of me to say at least sth in response to her question before asking my own. It's just polite. Also less working memory load for us both. M to try to make this a habit.

○ Recurring topic of slack: if I flub this it's also okay for e to say "could you answer my question first" or "how is that relevant". e to try and notice when she's thrown off by this kind of thing happening, and remember that she can ask that.

• the ritual misunderstanding & enthusiasm

○ M doesn't demand that e like or want to do whatever he's describing, just that she not react negatively to him describing it.

• past negative experience connections:

○ rationalist stf where we agreed it was okay for her to let me be excited by problematic things and we agree to discuss later

○ Times when e had sensory issues and m couldn't find any satisfactory way to express positivity or energy around her at all. (m acknowledges he still disregarded her sensory requests frequently and should have tried harder to not take her suffering personally.)

• as discussed before, "only if you're really into it" was meant to reference the apartment ritual where e wasn't really invested, and was reading negative things into it. But instead it communicated that it was super important to m that e \_say\_ she was into it and not even ask for space to think.

• recurring topic of slack:

○ e please let M know if you're feeling backed into a bad situation, instead of just letting the conversation get increasingly tense or doing sth you don't want to do

○ e please make the assumption that even if m is excited about something, he's not going to become a fanatic about it

• Other actions:

○ Everything we discussed about noticing mismatches and walking back to check for unshared assumptions, not just currently but earlier in the conversation

○ M maybe be clearer about what part of the idea is exciting

• how to notice assumption mismatches

○ It can be difficult. try to notice when we seem to be talking past each other

○ for big topics like the retreat, try sharing high-level goals too. This can be hard for m because talking about relationship things is usually scar

y

○ Michael be clearer about when you just don't remember something

• all the issues behind finding a place to live

○ Some big emotional things that are inextricably tangled with predictions and imminent decisions

○ M would be fine with leaving things loose -- otherwise he has to think about big issues like whether he's satisfied living in Fremont and in this situation. E would like to 1) be more certain, 2) limit number of future possible moves, 3) not have to deal with many potential stressors.

○ We should at least reach alignment on how loose we are going to leave things. (ie, if we move out stay in Fremont for 1-2 years w/o housemates, but what then?)

○ When figuring out BATNA, let's clearly establish that neither of us is going to demand that we move to a place the other hates.

○ Each of us has some dream places that might not suit the other; we could discuss those anyway (to 1) make sure we're aligned on assumptions and 2) see if there are ways to get some of the desired benefits anyway). But also note that current situation might be the best option we're going to find for a long time.

Any practices or assurances that would help? Didn't come up with anything. It would be a good practice to break the problem up and solve one piece at a time, but everything here is actually intertwined.
