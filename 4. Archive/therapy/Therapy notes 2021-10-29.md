# Therapy notes 2021-10-29

E to-do / reminders: 
Set reminder: After Michael returns from trip, discuss relationship patterns and E having more time with Michael and/or more energy
Set reminder: expectations and disconnections: check in 3 weeks from Sat
When Elizabeth feels like Michael is expressing distress reminiscent of the electric shock thing: "What should I do / what do you need from me right now?" If Elizabeth feels uncomfortable checking in again or like it implies she's been bad to him, check in later. 
M is fine interacting with signing people if there's an interpreter; the issue is about communication not sign per se

M to-do / reminders: 
Think about ambivalence and communicating it
Pre-relax time, come up with a potential topic to discuss
To ease things when complaining about work:
-- State intention
-- State what he wants E to do
-- Default time limit of 3 minutes, then E can ask if done / needs self-care


Both of us, to discuss in Sat therapy:
Procedural issue - Elizabeth not knowing M liked to talk to me about ASL
E supporting M with respect to ASL later
Talk about the present/future, separately from understanding/agreeing on what was said/meant in the past
Come up with short list of backup topics for relax time discussions
Schedule visit time during M trip

Discussing one thing at a time is important for us, especially when dealing with difficult issues

### Things E can do to support M re ASL:
### -- Try not to express anger when M brings the topic up
### -- Listen to him talk
### -- Help him make plans when he asks for advice

### Backup topic area ideas for relax time:
### -- Snails
### -- Maya
### -- E's bass lesson for that week
### -- E ASL classes

### In the future if we think the other person is uncomfortable with a topic, we should bring it up in therapy and ask what's going on
