# Gottman goals discussion with Michael

I committed to:
- Helping Michael pick a convention to attend
- Listen to him venting while he learns new things
- Support for work


My goals:
* Daily rhythm
	* "System maintenance": supports self-care, know what's right each time, simplify task switching
	* Michael can: Interact/remind me during day, come up with idea to test, interview during daily activities
* Weights, getting into shape
	* Michael can: tell me useful things, admire muscles
* DIY/home maintenance skills
	* Michael can: listen to me venting when things don't work out right, be an assistant if I need a second person, admire my finished work
