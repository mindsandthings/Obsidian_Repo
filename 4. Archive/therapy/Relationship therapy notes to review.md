# Relationship therapy notes to review

when asking to leave/stop convo because M is too anxious/distressed, be very clear on why I am asking for it and that it's still ok for him to be anxious/distressed

2 kinds of situations:
 - M feels compelled to get something off his chest before he can talk about anything else
 - he's emotional

spend fewer resources on tolerating situations and more on exiting them in an appropriate and validating way

to me
I took some notes from our conversation today. I can share them if you want a refresher but they're kind of... egocentric. I also made this list of specific things we talked about working on:

    Michael: recalibrate when I think it's okay to talk to elizabeth about random things
    Michael: express specific things I like about the house/housemates
    Michael: Think about what I do need in order to feel comfortable having positive interactions, and how to get it or ask for it [nb, this has been a major challenge for me to work on over the past couple of years and might not have an easy solution]
    Elizabeth and Michael: If you think the other person feels a certain way -- even if you're so sure about it that you wouldn't think of asking about it -- still bring this up during checkins by expressing how it's affecting you.  I don't consider this passive-aggressive, anyway.
    Elizabeth and Michael: Find some opportunities for casual contact now that our daily routines don't put us together much.
