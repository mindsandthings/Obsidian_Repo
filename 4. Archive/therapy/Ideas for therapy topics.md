# Ideas for therapy topics
[includes many clips from Crazyboards journal]

* go to synagogue
intense emotional responses to some things
social media overwhelm/can't participate
No desire to make connections / dimished physical ability to do so
 
* Want to take class and request accommodations. I have some previous testing but it was ten years ago and across the country. 
 
I thought I had a formal diagnosis but I'm not sure the therapist who told me I was, was qualified to
***Read  
* Accommodations I want: a microphone for classes so I can use live transcribe; get slides/announcements/any important info in writing; if group work and multiple groups talking, need to be able to take group to a quiet space. (Might work better via ADHD?)
 
	* Looking for therapy with someone experienced with working with adult autistic women
	* Difficulty having motivation to develop friendships
	* Getting older and having difficulty with self-image
	* There are other things
	* I'm considering taking some classes and would like to request accommodations but I don't think I have whatever paperwork I need

Make wallet cards with situations and solutions for times when I'm too upset to self-regulate but could follow directions
 
Remind myself that truth exists despite others' thoughts (e.g., just because someone tells me I'm naive doesn't ensure that I am)
 
20-point difference between verbal and performance IQ. When information processing speed factors are somewhat control, it drops to a 9-pt difference. Apparently I also tend to make a very large speed-accuracy tradeoff - scoring 66th percentile on a digit-search task with speed in the 12th percentile. Overall summary is that I'm pretty smart with noticeable deficits in "processing speed under certain conditions (complex stimuli), problem solving, and encoding/recall of new information".

	*  [cognitivesocial issues](https://www.crazyboards.org/forums/index.php?/tags/cognitivesocial%20issues/) 

 
* My pdoc referred me to their therapy unit, and last night a therapist called to set up an appointment with me. It's on Dec 8. Pdoc agrees with me that I need skill-learning and problem-solving help, particularly surround social issues, rather than talking about my feelings or my childhood. I don't know whether the therapist knows that, or whether he knows anything about me at all.
 
I'm thinking about what things I actually need help with. I'd like to be able to make and keep friends but that's much less pressing than work, and I've mostly given up on it at this point.
 
To succeed at my job I need:
 
1. To be comfortable interrupting people while they're trying to work, and do so without hesitation
 
2. To automatically reach for the phone rather than email when I need to talk to someone, unless they're within walking distance and then I need to go interrupt them while they're trying to work. To have speaking with someone feel real and genuine to me, when I'm spending all my energy trying to make it feel real and genuine for the other person, and have no idea how I would make it feel real and genuine anyway.
 
3. To confidently social network when I'm stressed, tired, a long way from home, and overwhelmed enough to start crying in public.
 
4. To default to communicating not just verbally but the kind of verbally that requires remembering complicated branching chains of things I need to remember to say, or being able to make the list of stuff that I need to say match up with the conversation I'm having when I'm spending almost all my time trying to make the conversation work already
 
5. To be the kind of person for whom the above is second nature or at least third nature, or to convincingly fake it to everyone but myself, both of which make me want to die.
 
6. To remember that no one else works like this because I need to always remember what I'm not so that I can remember to fake it. To never talk about it even if I'm extremely frustrated, because when I say I have deficiencies there's a high risk of other people thinking I'm saying that they have deficiencies. (When they say they're not good at something, do they really mean that they think other people are good at the wrong things or something?)
 
 
 
 
I can't be some other kind of person. And taking on even more burden to honestly and genuinely be something I can't be is very much like what I was asked to do by my crazy advisor during the period of time that I repeatedly sought professional help to deal with and could never get addressed more than briefly. Although it might seem like not that big a deal, it's an extremely big deal, and the last few months are the first time that I've felt like my advisor was someone who was really truly only relevant in the distant past, rather than always in danger of happening to me in the present. I don't think deliberately forcing myself into trying to fake genuine compliance is going to be any healthier for me now than it was then, and I don't want to spend another three years getting to the point where I'm not constantly obsessing about it and another three years and a bunch of medication after that getting to the point where it doesn't influence the decisions I make about what to do and who to talk to and what to say.
 
This list was going to be "1. call people on phone, 2. interrupt people, 3. figure out how to walk people through complicated things verbally even though I can't track it myself if I don't have it written down to look at in front of me so how can they?" with maybe some "no one believes me when I say I can't do things and when I try to explain that I have deficits they think I'm calling them stupid". but that's not it.
 
I have to reinterpret this into some framework that will make sense to my therapist. I'm not sure what. I don't think taking away all my social anxiety will make me able to become someone else. I'm not a socially anxious person with basically normal social skills who hides behind the Internet because she's anxious about having conversations, I'm a socially anxious person who has successfully developed a number of social skills that are still often stressful to use, and who uses the Internet because she likes the internet and likes to talk to people in writing and feels open and honest when doing that.
 
Would I like to be less socially anxious when interacting with people? Fuck yeah. Is that going to solve the problems I'm having? No, but it might make them a little easier, and I'd be okay with that, I just don't want someone else to pressure me to genuinely appear as though my problems are solved because they're giving me what's supposed to solve my problems. Like at work where I'm supposed to learn things, but I'm not supposed to *learn* them, I'm supposed to learn-them-through-a-particular-way-of-learning-things-which-is-the-only-way-of-learning-things-which-means-it-will-work.
 
god I just can't make these things a normal length.
 
It's a good thing I have two weeks to turn this into the equivalent of a powerpoint slide, rather asking someone for help with all of it because I don't know how to solve my problems myself and it's very hard for me to turn those problems into things that are easily dealt with and make sense and can be expressed in quick talking points that are easily to accurately replicate inside someone else's head.
 
not that I'm bitter.
 
 
 
 
I really just want a way to interface with the world that makes things easier for me, instead of making me look like someone who doesn't have any problems.
 
I just want some kind of comfortable eccentricity.

Do you have phone issues or is it just a phone in the workplace issue? My folks don't get why I'd still rather email them than phone them. I talked to Penny on the phone for the first time last week and we've known each other what, four years now?
 
What's wrong with making notes for a conversation you're about to have, a list of stuff to mention and then following it? It's a little weird but it's not too offputting. Is it?

Phone issues. I'm ok with family and with my not-boyfriend, though, and with a family friend who's like family. (Talking with Dad is often kind of awkward but I think that's partly him.)
 
Notes help me remember things but they're not very versatile - if the conversation goes away from the notes I find it hard to get it back. I can, but it sometimes involves steamrolling the other person by ignoring their response to me and forcing a change of topic. I also find it hard to simultaneously attend to a conversation, respond to the other person, look at and think about my notes, and work them into the conversation when the conversation has stopped being about the thing in the notes.
 
They're very helpful with customer service-type stuff, because they provide a kind of moral support that enables me to keep the other person from ending the call when I'm not done.
 
I also sometimes get frustrated and mentally scattered when the conversation goes all over the place because it seems so inefficient. I have quick concise talking points and I can't get them all out and I'm thinking ahead to how I'm going to make sure the next one gets covered and that distracts me from what's going on right at the time. I think that's a pretty clear therapy-type problem on my end.
 
Not all of it's that bad, some phone conversations go perfectly well.

* From  [this link](https://www.crazyboards.org/forums/index.php?/blogs/entry/17026-words-make-worlds-real/) . Page down to below the question in bold, to where she starts talking about the cognitive dissonance that she experiences when she hears someone say something that isn't true.
 
1. That is very much true for me. I would really like to be in therapy to talk to someone about this and a bunch of other stuff but not if they're going to ignore or disbelieve me.
 
2. It's really hard for me to separate other peoples' beliefs about how the world works from my own, like about how if you go to a lot of therapists and can't get effective help it's your own fault, versus my experience of having actual, severely life-impacting problems that get ignored or dismissed by therapists.
 
3. Even though I can't separate other peoples' beliefs about how the world works from my own, I also can't resolve serious contradictions. So I wind up saying them both over and over and getting more and more upset, because on some level I'm desperately hoping that someone will say "yeah, those two worldviews really are in severe contradiction with each other" and "here is why that is happening" so that I'm not alone and I'm not the only one who can see it and it /makes sense/ in a way that has been put into words. It is extremely, extremely distressing, because it is frightening to me that I do not have a way to resolve the two and feel intense pressure to make the other person's worldview be true, but I am unable to do so because it is not true, and I am frightened that I will never be able to resolve the tension or even get anyone else to notice or care that it exists, and it is extremely distressing to me to be abandoned to what for me is a task that is impossible to solve but that I cannot be ok with until I have solved it, because it puts my ability to trust in a coherent, predictable reality into question.
 
4. I'm not making this up. I'm not exaggerating. This is the first time I've been able to verbalize what the problem is in this way. I am actually aware that you almost certainly find this bizarre, irrational, and wrong. That doesn't make it less painful for me.
 
5. When I cannot trust in a predictable reality, it doesn't mean that I experience a less predictable reality. It means that I am frightened and in pain, and am unable to force myself to cease believing in my own reality, but if I have been abandoned to the task of having to make things right for other people, and my attempts to communicate have not resulted in the other person even recognizing that my reality is not the same as theirs, I don't have anything else I can do other than keep the two beliefs circulating in my head. If I'm capable of responding in a healthier way, I start stating both as if I believed they were both true. If I'm not capable of responding in a healthier way, I take it out on myself.
 
6. When I get extremely irrational and start flipping back and forth between extreme accounts of what I believe or what I think is happening, it's because I cannot come up with any other way in which to talk about what's going on and also can't cope with a reality in which the unresolvable contradiction is not observed or acknowledged no matter how bizarre and unbelievable it is, or the existence of the unresolvable contradiction is being attributed to me as though I'd come up with it on my own.
 
7. When that doesn't work, I am sometimes able to verbalize that I'm in a great deal of pain, and having that acknowledged helps. At other times, I physically hurt myself, emotionally hurt other people, or break stuff.
 
8. It would be really nice to be able to talk to a therapist about this, but it's very hard to do that when a therapist has a strong belief in my capacity to overcome difficulties, and is trying to treat me by pressuring me to share that belief. It's also very difficult when I try to talk about this and I'm ignored or refocused on something else, because that replicates the problem. I'm still not able to deal with the problem, the therapist doesn't believe it exists or could exist, and it's now falling to me to fix the contradiction between their beliefs and my own.
 
9. I feel very angry and very whiny about the fact that I want the therapist to be helping me, instead me being placed in the position of making the therapist's worldview come true for them. I feel extremely entitled to the belief that this is a morally wrong thing for me to be asked to do, but I also feel very immoral for holding a belief that strong.
 
10. You can tell me some variant of the belief that no one can actually do anything "to" another person without their permission. That's great. Can I come live in your world where things like this don't happen to me? I'd like to get there, but I can't seem to get out of my own world.
 
 
I think the flip side is that the lack of words makes worlds unreal, and when I can't get my words together, the world becomes unreal and that is very frightening because it feels like it is actually happening to me when that happens. The world becoming unreal.

* PJ posted a link to  [http://www.aspergerjourneys.com](http://www.aspergerjourneys.com/)  on the autism board. I could have written pretty much everything in that blog myself with a few exceptions.
Especially entries like this:
*  [http://www.aspergerjourneys.com](http://www.aspergerjourneys.com/) /2009/02/22/women-girls-and-aspergers-syndrome/ (I read every book I could find on social skills during high school and I have two masters' degrees that involve the study of normal people)
*  [http://www.aspergerjourneys.com](http://www.aspergerjourneys.com/) /2009/06/09/words-truth-and-literal-thinking/ (when people say things that aren't true and supply me with a reality that is completely out of sync with my own experiences it takes on a life of its own; nothing means anything anymore and I'm endlessly caught between my reality and theirs, unable to resolve the conflicts)
This is very distressing to me for many reasons:
1. I have described major social-related problems to almost every mental health practitioner I've seen, and have gone to multiple therapists asking for help with those specifically. I've always described them as major issues that seriously impact my life. I've been ignored or gently refocused, and, when I finally started refusing to just drop the issue and insisting over and over like a socially-insensitive repetitive robot, been reassured that there was nothing wrong with me but (unjustified) anxiety.
2. Several friends and family members have told me that they think I have undiagnosed Asperger's. If that were true, surely some of my mental health providers would have been willing to talk with me about social skills issues rather than assuring me they didn't exist?
3. Online autism communities can be social minefields if you don't get the rules right. Rules sometimes include things like stay the fuck out if you don't have a diagnosis, don't act like you know anything unless you're speaking from personal experience of being autistic, and don't stand up for anyone autistic you care about if you're not autistic yourself.
4. I would fit in very poorly to most online autism communities for being so pro-scientist, for valuing social niceties because they are important to many people, thinking that autism spectrum disorders are disorders and not different ways of being, and thinking that people with Asperger's and high functioning autism really are very different from autistic people who are invisible because they do not have communication and/or are institutionalized.
5. I sympathize very much with parents who are raising autistic children.
6. I can hold conversations, make eye contact, and implement a variety of other social skills. It takes me a great deal of effort and concentration, but it's something I can do. It's largely for the other person's benefit, and often results in them feeling an emotional connection with me that I don't feel with them. Therapy replicates this. I think therapists think I'm making progress because I'm able to simulate this for them.
7. I don't have problems picking up on what other people feel and think. My problem is that I pick them ALL up and I pick them all up consciously and it's very hard for me to figure out which ones I'm supposed to respond to and how versus which ones I'm supposed to respond to but not acknowledge. I've run into some discussion of this, but it's not the right kind of problem.
8. Sometimes it's extremely effortful for me to manage conversations and sometimes it's easy.
9. I feel socially required because of identity politics to insist that I cannot have Asperger's because I do not have a diagnosis. It's something I really want to talk about but the social-minefield social rules issue is very difficult for me to cope with.
10. After years of therapy, I don't have a hope in hell that anyone would either believe me or humor me or be willing to treat past experiences as indicative of future experiences. I go to therapy and ask for help and have my problems ignored or normalized, and every time that happens it's worse. (Added to by my repeated attempts to get help for dealing with fallout from an abusive work relationship, which also results in being ignored or refocused or told that my problems are anxiety.)
11. I feel like I'm decompensating wrt social stuff as though I were borrowing symptoms.
12. Many of the skills I've developed are unsustainable. They're skills, but they're the wrong ones. It's like being a college who can sleep four hours a night during finals week and pull off straight A's, and having the ability to do that taken as evidence that I can do that every night for the rest of my life. I don't know how to back down. I don't know how to negotiate workable compromises.
13. In grad school I got an ADD/math problems issues evaluation from students with disabilities services. I was told my problems were only weak spots, given the impression that I was wasting time and resources that would have been better spent on people with real problems, told that it was part of bipolar, and even though I said over and over that what I was looking for were resources that would help me deal with the problems I was having, all he would do was ask me what accommodations I wanted.
14. Every time something upsetting happens it's worse than the last time because I have more and more previous bad experiences. This makes me look especially unreasonable.
15. I'm taking 2-4 times my normal amount of klonopin to deal with what are probably reasonable feelings surrounding these issues. I really want to be able to talk about them in therapy without the therapist ignoring or normalizing them. I'm not sure how I'm going to get through the next four months. I'm not sure how I'm going to get through the rest of my life.
16. I want to go to a specialist and be assessed after I finish up my current work assignment and move, but I worry that no diagnosis will mean no help.

I think I feel so much tension because diagnosis, treatment, and acceptance are clearly outlined in diagnostic criteria and supplemented by newer research, but like so many other things, are informed by intuitive, socially shared implicit beliefs about what is "normal" and what is "not normal". And whether someone is "normal" or "not normal" is supported by intuitive evaluation - quick impressions based on surface impressions. Even though experience encourages me to know better, I still go in to mental health appointments expecting that what will happen will be based on explicit, often written, accumulated knowledge - I think I keep expecting authorities to do things the way I think is the "right" way, by evaluating deep (rather than surface) attributes against criteria and research.And when they don't, I fall apart. Because if I can't trust authorities to know when their own intuitions aren't right to apply, then no explicit knowledge means anything, because it takes place in a world of statements that doesn't intersect with the world of actions. They run parallel to each other but don't correspond, and the one that I can read properly is the world of statements.

* Yesterday I was thinking about my friendships in high school, college, and grad school, and realized how frequently they were qualitatively different from the social relationships I had over the last year and the social interactions I'm having now at work and the friendships I have here. I think the difference is that in school, the social opportunities I had open were often bit actor roles in the play of someone else's life. Or maybe NPC roles. Kind of like a cross between "we're holding auditions, nobody else better has shown up" and having the the role's existence and the fact that I will fill it taken for granted - not needed, but naturally there for the play's main character when it happens to be present.
 
I think that the fact I chose to try to play those roles was mostly about my own hangups and intense social anxiety, but I don't think the availability of those roles had as much to do with anything I did - I think this was their way of being in the world. More so with some people and less so with others. And less so during high school, and with fewer people during my graduate school psych program (though nearly everyone in my info science program), and with some exceptions during college as well, but I still had a lot of interactions with the major people in my life that make a lot more sense when I think about them in those terms - where when I said or did things that were beyond the bit part, they were problematic because they didn't fit with the play's available roles. So they were politely ignored. And when I wasn't available to fill them - was living ten minutes away, or was severely depressed - I dropped out of sight and out of mind. And in the severe depression case I was seen by one person as deliberately being rude to her by not fulfilling my role, like if a supporting actor didn't bother showing up and it was insulting to the star.
 
I think it bothered me more than other people. I don't know why for sure. Maybe if your world is naturally a play about you you're less likely to notice that other people think it's about them, or you don't take them particularly seriously because you know they're wrong.
 
Some of them were very interesting people and I wanted to get a reciprocal thing going, but wasn't able to. I regret that because I think we could have learned a lot from each other. Sometimes I thought I had a reciprocal thing going, but didn't, and I regret that because it wound up being intensely painful for me.
 
 
As crappy as my job the last year was, I had some social interactions and some friends that were very different. There were some extremely notable people with whom I felt relegated to a non-player-character bit role, or relegated out of existence, and a lot of awful situations with other people that also felt like that, and it sucked and I was miserable. But I had relatively more interactions where someone actually wanted to talk to me about something in a reciprocal kind of way.
 
My temporary 5-month assignment here also seems to be like that. Even when my conversations are mostly me asking other people questions to draw them out and get them to tell me about things they like (which I enjoy doing), I don't feel like they're assuming they have the main character role and ignoring anything I do that doesn't fit into the bit part role. With rare exceptions.
 
Here, too. Not with everybody on CB, but there are a lot of people here who are listening to what other people say, including when it's unexpected. Maybe more if it's unexpected. Because it's more interesting.
 
 
 
I guess the difference is between being one minor but sometimes convenient mirror in somebody else's hall of many full-length mirrors, and meeting someone who has a hand mirror and also having a hand mirror myself, and our taking turns looking into each other's mirrors, but also looking at each other outside of the mirrors, because they're not so big that they block you from seeing the actual person.

I smashed pieces off of my keyboard while trying to write an entry about how my therapist thinks what I really need is not improved skills negotiating compromises, but to be more comfortable being truly myself with people, and to lower my standards for myself.
I say things and people don't understand me.
I say things and I don't know how to say them without being passive-aggressive.
I say things and the act of working through all the right things to say makes me want to die, because I can't tell people that I have to work through all those things.
My hands hurt.
I smashed my keyboard into my desk by slamming my hands down onto it repeatedly as hard I could.
I was trying to write an entry explaining what would really happen if I were to be truly myself with people, and explaining why I cannot even explain to my therapist why that does not work.
The topics are all forbidden. Not to her; she can tell me I'm a wonderful very smart person all she likes. But I can't even tell her why I want her to stop, because it would be elitist.
Someday I will kill myself over this issue. Over not being able to be honest with my therapist and not being believed when I am. Over being told what my problems are by someone who knows nothing about my life but what I tell them, and disbelieves what I say in favor of more plausible alternatives. Over someone thinking that they will make me feel better by telling me I'm smart. Over knowing that I have to play along, not because it makes me feel better, but because it makes *them* feel better to tell me I'm smart.
Over being given the competing demands of maintaining everyone else's self-esteem while turning out an absolute top-notch product. Over being told to hold to high standards, but not expected to. Over being told to lower my standards for myself, but with no guidance on how to do so. Over being told to not embarrass anyone or stepping on anyone's toes.
I am so angry right now I want to start screaming. I want to delete my CB account. I want to call back the acupuncturist who just called me and said "I'm not sure why you said your insurance doesn't pay for acupuncture" and scream at him that the reason is that the manual is confusing, the customer service is deliberately evasive, and that I do not, personally, have the benefit of being an acupuncturist who is familiar with different insurance plans, and consequently it is unrealistic of him to express surprise at my failure to understand my insurance benefits.
I want to call [redacted] openly on her utter fucking bullshit and her utterly fucking ridiculous game of "play along with me" and "don't act like I believe what I say". I want to scream at [redacted] for acting like she's so utterly fucking wise when she's being fatalist and jumping to absurd conclusions about my ability to know myself.
I want to post in public the usernames of all the people who are de-diagnosing people they find annoying with bipolar, and re-diagnosing them with borderline, and then claiming that there's no value judgment involved. Utter. Fucking. Bullshit.
I want to go into work tomorrow smashed out of my mind and giggle my way through training because everything is so fucking hysterical. I want to drink until I pass out in public. I want to laugh at my co-workers and tell them about my experiences with my agency. I want to burn every bridge I've ever had and then I will kill myself.
I want everyone to die. I want to die. I want to never be a problem for anyone else again. I want to stop being a problem and the only way I know of is to remove myself.
I want to stomp people I hate into oblivion. I want to open my refrigerator and smash everything breakable all over the kitchen.
- - - -
I'm not going to do that, you know.
I don't want people to tell me to be truly myself when they have no. fucking. idea. of what that would involve, or of what the repercussions would be.
Sometimes I think that if I hurt myself enough I will stop hurting. But I never do, and it never lasts. I can never keep myself out of control long enough to do any real damage.
And I cannot get therapy for any of this. I need help so badly sometimes because it hurts so much. But there's no help. The help makes it worse because they suggest things that already didn't work and they make assumptions that are painfully not true.
And I'll be fine tomorrow anyway, so what does it matter? I'm self-maintaining; I not only can't get help but I don't need it because I can decide not to do this. so I can just be left alone until things get better.
I want to be somebody else's problem. Not my own.

You need to find a way to find a happy medium, though.
TO be able to be pleased and proud of the things you do and say and stand by them.
I really feel like you need a new therapist which is [ducks] probably not what you want to hear. But I feel like you have so many communication/relation/trust problems with this one. Maybe I'm just interpreting that wrong.
I do tend to hop in and out of blogs and I can't always keep everything straight so I'm sorry if I'm wrong on that one.
I feel like part of it is an intense desire to be seen as honest. Where, as long as you know you are honest, in a lot of cases, it doesn't matter because they are, in terms of the whole picture, such small things that they will normally just fly by the other person. Where as they stick with you.
Things like when you are misunderstood.
I know it's frustrating, but I think you are approaching a point where you're going to explode if you can't get a grip on what it's like to give yourself a break and lower these harsh expectations of yourself.
I feel like no one understands eachother perfectly all of the time and they just smile and nod and continue on their way.
There has to be some points for some things where you can just say "fuck it." because it's NOT that important.
I don't know how you can get there.
Because you're like dying inside over these super high expectations you have of yourself.
You can't do one thing because you would be seen as this, you can't do another because you would be seen as that. But if you AREN'T those things, isn't that what matters?
I mean, feel free to ignore me if I just don't fucking get it.
That's possible.

I lowered my expectations of myself enormously at work several months ago. I'm outputting at approximately 30% of capacity and spending a lot of time goofing off on the internet, staring blankly at reading material, or looking for another job. I bet a million dollars if I told any of the people who tell me to lower my expectations about that that they'd say wtf that's not what I meant! and then they'd redefine it to mean "meet MY standards without me telling you what they are or giving you any guidance in meeting them, because MY standards for YOU are the RIGHT standards for you and I know this without knowing anything about what you really do at your current job, at past jobs, or during your education".
I have the same problem with all therapists, as this one made clear by asking me about my reasosns for quitting other therapists. Its because I try to get help with the major problems in my life I can't solve on my own and then it devolves into them treating me for whatever they like to treat people for.
But it's my fault because I'm not being receptive to what they have to offer to me. That came through loud and clear with this therapist.
I think she might be one the quickest and most perceptive therapist I've ever had.
there's no point in me trying to go to yet another therapist asking for help with what I think I need when they already decide I need somethign else

we were supposed to brainstorm ways to improve the airline checkin process. for a training exercise. we were told to have fun. I could have had fun easily - I love doing stuff like that and I can do it off the cuff. Coming up with 2-3 suggestions for improvement for each step in the process would have been an easy, entertaining, and fun task.
I didn't do that, because it was difficult for my group members to come up with even one suggestion (not one suggestion for each step, one suggestion per person). Instead I offered two suggestions and then felt guilty about that and guilty about the fact that I mentioned that online check-in exists in current-day airports.
Lowering my standards actually makes things much worse sometimes. Both because to do it I have to invent and convincingly portray myself as someone with a different skillset, and because it even further reduces the possibility that I might get to do something fun and challenging at some point.
what I really want are social connections. But if I can't have those, get help developing them, or even convince anyone that I'm having difficulty, the next best thing is getting to do things I like to do and feeling the satisfaction of doing them well. It's a temporary relief from anxiety and boredom, and it's the only consistently effective one I can implement on my own.
without that.....it's just chronic anxiety and boredom. being miserable. I did that nearly all the time for years and years and years, and kept hoping the next thing would help. I mean, people told me higher education would be good for it and would bring you lots of friends too.

I mean, it's more draining and exhausting and less rewarding to lower my expectations for myself than it is to keep them even as high as they are now, which is about knee-high. Ankle-high is harder, not easier, because it is even less rewarding. This is something that it's hard for me to convey to therapists, I think. Because they jump to the conclusion that the behavior they want me to stop fulfills no function.
and in this case what they want me to stop is what makes my inability to get what I asked them for tolerable. if they could help me with what I try to get help for, then what they want to treat me for really would go away without creating any problems.
but no. they;ve got to fix the fact that I want to achieve tasks by telling me to stop wanting to. and then in the same session they compliment me on being smart. so I'm supposed to feel good about myself because I have something that I did nothing to achieve and that disadvantages other people, and I'm not supposed to use it to help other people. I'm just supposed to bask in my glory, or something, maybe. Or somethign similar that would be completely inappropriate if I actually did it in real life.

I think you misinterpret what I mean.
I think you are trying to be a perfect individual.

And I'm not.
But when I'm trying to get a comfortable level of challenge, it sometimes looks like that to other people.
And that's why I'm not even supposed to talk about this here.
