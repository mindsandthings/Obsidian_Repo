# Therapy notes Mario Tues, Aug 24, 2021

~Intention-stating~
* Discussion: It's been useful. M has found himself more aware of when conversations are asymmetric. 
* **Both: Continue stating our intentions for each conversation. Pay attention to when/why it's useful. At Sep 1 check-in, discuss how/when to keep doing it. 

~E honesty~
* **E: Attending to internal cue of wanting to leave: re-up, check back at next therapy appt.
*  **E: pay attention when honesty comes up. What comes up for me when trying to be honest; what makes it difficult or easy. [have put into my reminders app] Reevaluate a week from Wed.
* Discussion: 
	* E worries about not wanting to shake up relationship. M worries that E will be cold and intolerant and he'll never be good enough and I'll be too needy. This has been less bad in the last couple years. M afraid he'll always be trapped in the relationship and always insufficient, though that hasn't been his dominant perspective for a while. 
	* What changed? Things just got easier; E health improvements; M has changed

~Follow-up on Sat convo on M honesty~
* Status: M will let E know when he's ready to revisit this
* Discussion:
	* Re my saying what he did for my birthday made me feel loved, and him feeling uncomfortable and also uncomfortable with feeling uncomfortable
	* Early in relationship he wanted E to get along with his friends, pagan training, E's response to both was upsetting. M wasn't comfortable standing up strongly.
* M sense of losing the specialness of something if he shares it. Fear of being compromised 
* E asks if it's something we can't work around or deal with; M says options are poke around the edges and/or get a more verbal understanding of the underlying need, and probably should do both
* **M: work with self on figuring out what he's ok with talking about


Job changes (Michael's)
* **E should note if she wants Michael to stop saying he's scared


~Attachment stuff~
* We mentioned it to Mario and I don't think he was much into it - says there's a lot of hybridization/bastardization of it

~E emotions in therapy~
* M would like E to show more emotional responses in therapy
* Next time we will record. E will take notes and jot down the time when she left off taking notes so we can get it from the recording later 

~Job changes and/or health changes (Elizabeth)~
* [Same list here as from last time]
* **E: be honest about it if I want to put the novel on hold / stop the novel
* **E: evaluate time commitments 3 weeks into semester
* **Both: discuss how it's going 3 weeks into semester (or earlier if it merits it)


Relationship patterns [notes from before. is this the same as the honesty stuff we talked about?]
* M: when we do stuff together, difficult for him to balance between being present and enjoying the now, and expecting bad things to happen due to past experiences
* Can E help? E suggested that M acknowledge negative feelings. M concern is this relies on being intimate in situations where he has difficulty being intimate
* M thinks E may have the wrong mental model of what's going on
* M is not always sure he wants to be in the relationship and feels bad about feeling it. E prefers he talk about it, says feels financial stuff between the two of us has been worked out and if it would help we can discuss how ending the relationship would work in terms of rent or other practical matters. 
* **M: bring up in individual therapy? and then talk about it in our Saturday therapy afterward


Postponed or in process:
* [postpone, not sure how to address] Insight into why sometimes uncomfortable with touch -- how much is dispositional, situational, residual
* [postpone, M individual therapy and we talk about together later] * dealing with my frustration/anger/guilt over having screwed up touch in our relationship and difficulty accepting that moving forward it's not something I can fix
* Learn about possible relationship patterns and how to experiment with them [currently: spending time together, working on tat]
* [in process] * How to get out of pattern of expecting the other person to act or react negatively, leading to greater disconnection
* [good for now] Wanting to talk about stuff from past, but E asks to keep to how it affects the present instead of talking about how it felt for me at the time
* [discussed 8/7; reevaluate later] How to deal with changes in relationship due to e being healthier or changing careers
