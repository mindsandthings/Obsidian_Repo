# Gottmann dreams
To have a sense of order (and stability, and CONTROL. I want to feel that there are times to do things, and I do those things when it is those times)
To relax (to have an ebb and flow of productivity and relaxation)


The most feasible/realistic dreams:
	•	To explore the physical side of myself or become an athlete (build muscles, gain physical capacity)
	⁃	I've just always liked this
	⁃	gender reasons / comfy place [not comfortable sharing]

Take it or leave it:
	•	Learn woodworking / home improvement
	⁃	I just like it
	⁃	This is something my Dad did that I never did



Dream that matters the most: 
Dream that matters but isn't as important
Dream that would be great to fulfill but is a "take it or leave it"

To tell M: the story behind each dreams and how it will feel to fulfill it

Location: find a place that inspires you and inspires your dreams. If there's an important place go there. 

Don't question or dismiss a dream. Don't jump into practicalities. Remember you can't know the future. Ask big questions to understand the dream, including anything in their childhood that has given birth to the dream.

Questions for date conversation, after discussing exercise:
Did you have any dreams for yourself when you were a child? [to go to Space Camp. To become an astronaut. Later, to understand people and to connect with people who are interesting]
Do you think your parents fulfilled their dreams? [Dad yes Mom no? or maybe? but then she rejected it?]
Did your parents support you in fulfilling your childhood dreams? [I have no fucking idea. they kind of generally supported me, I think? but not by capitalizing on specifics? and it's not like I was interested in these things then]
Why is the dream in your innermost circle so important to you? 
Does it relate to your childhood or history in some way? How so?  
Is there an underlying purpose for your fulfilling your dream?  
How would you feel if this dream was fulfilled? If it wasn’t?  Tell me more about your other two dreams.









Sometimes I want the freedom to move in the world as a man

I want to make decisions based on realistic beliefs about my future

There are 2 strategies: focus in on what I can control, or focus outward on changing my circumstances

My real inner dream: achieve safety
	•	To have a U.S. exit plan [issue is: want to do without Michael but can't tell him that]
	•	To escape to a safer country
	•	and my internal dream is to have a good connection with myself
