What
Thurs 10.21.2021
 
*         Effectively manage transition back into a more "normal" life thanks to health improvements. In particular, handle self-care and life/work balance effectively while going back to school (and potentially eventually back to work). 
 
 
⁃        Stop at stop times. 
No
 
⁃        Amount of stress as a measure of balance. Do I feel like everything is under control y/n? Do I feel excessively stressed y/n?
Excessively stressed, not under control
 
⁃        Not pushing food late; am I getting up and moving around during the day etc. 
Did not
 
⁃        Am I using games to zone out instead of doing something refreshing? 
Yes; nothing felt refreshing
 
*         Be more reliably able to listen to myself, especially to listen to my concerns or reservations when I'm feeling good. 
 
 
⁃        Taking on commitments I later regret. On average, looking back on the week, how often did I do this? 
Attempted 2x: 
Volunteering for CRHE
Allowing Eric to assume I would get the car
 
⁃        Do I later feel uncomfortable about something I did in a social space because of information I had available but didn't take into account at the time? 
Yes:
I read off my whole list of homework in class, because I wasn't expecting the question and because I was disoriented and wasn't mentally storing what other people were saying, and distressed from needing to speak
* 


 
⁃        Motivation/emotions: did I take into account how I would feel while doing it / as a result of it, or just while I was making the decision? 
Just what I was feeling at the time
 
*         Become more able to engage with topics and memories that connect to trauma while staying calm
 
 
⁃        How comfortable do I feel about reengaging with a place that has triggers?
Not comfortable
 
⁃        When I think of past phases of life, how often do I either obsess about them or make myself have to stop thinking about them? 
Most times
