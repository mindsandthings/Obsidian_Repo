how do you adapt trauma-focused therapies for autistic adults? 

what would you consider realistic social fears for autistic adults? 

how many autistic adults have you worked with directly on trauma caused by regular psychotherapy? (Not ABA or therapies targeting autistic children, but regular psychotherapy widely in use)
