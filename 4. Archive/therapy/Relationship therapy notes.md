# Relationship therapy notes

#z-archives/therapynotes

About Michael:
* Insight into why sometimes uncomfortable with touch -- how much is dispositional, situational, residual
* Wanting to talk about stuff from past, but E asks to keep to how it affects the present instead of talking about how it felt for me at the time
* dealing with my frustration/anger/guilt over having screwed up touch in our relationship and difficulty accepting that moving forward it's not something I can fix
* How to deal with changes in relationship due to e being healthier or changing careers

Both of us:
* How to be more honest with each other
* How to get out of pattern of expecting the other person to act or react negatively, leading to greater disconnection
* Learn about possible relationship patterns and how to experiment with them



7/24 therapy notes

-- Trial: I can ask M if he wants to interact / how he feels, and he will try to answer accurately 
-- Michael: consider politely declining as a way of taking care of Elizabeth
-- Elizabeth will try to do the same
-- We will evaluate at next therapy appointment
-- Michael can ask Elizabeth at any time if she's upset with him
-- Michael: bring up fear of doing something wrong / fear of Elizabeth being upset with therapist

For our Saturday therapy: transparent communication, trust in each other

"Us" time: walk, read a book to each other, games
