	* 
* M will try to draft something that will get at what he's talking about
* other areas
	* household tasks
	* relationship work
	* recreation
* M 
	* don't want to take what E does for granted
	* doesn't want to feel like he can't take basic care of himself
	* wants to feel like he has some control over where he lives
