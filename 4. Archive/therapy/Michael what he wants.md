# Michael what he wants

* General subject eg "some difficulty in my writers group", 
* how bad is it "eg how severe should he expect disruption to my life to be, do I expect lonng term or short term), 
* what are you doing to cope (eg planning to reduce writing commitments, play games, spend X hours/days by myself), 
* to what extent I want him to interact with me vs leave me alone 
* if it isn't tell him it's not about him. 
* If I know, tell him what I want him to do.
