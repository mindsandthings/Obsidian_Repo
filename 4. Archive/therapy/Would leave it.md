# Would leave it
Would leave if:
 
 - michael lied to us about his relationship with someone else (underrepresenting the attachment)
 - we felt dissociated and gaslighted about his dating someone else
 - will we leave if we can support ourself? maybe. We care for Maya and don't want to leave her
 - if we have a realistic likelihood of obtaining financial independence (working and able to save for retirement) then we will reevaluate
 - maybe with ASL we could move to Canada and work there. we can look into that more later. we may not be able to because of disability of health, depends.
 - we start finding ourselves constantly lying to him emotionally
 - we would have to live alone with him again, or with his friends and not mine
 - he decides he wants to leave
 - we couldn't stand seeing him date other people for whoever reason
 - if we want to
