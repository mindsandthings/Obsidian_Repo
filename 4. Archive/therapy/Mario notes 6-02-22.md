Therapy with Mario notes 6/22/22

Topic of M needing to be able to express strong emotions in an uncensored fashion to feel supported

Keep in mind different family cultures around anger and honesty

E can bring up to M if he is saying something extreme or untrue in a rant (e.g. that something always happens, but it actually only happens 10% of the time)

Talk later about how M supports E

Pay E to listen to M rant?

E has concerns about listening to M direct anger/contempt at himself = legitimizing it

If M says things when mad that differ from what he endorses while calm, E wants to know later what he thinks when calm so as not to get a distorted picture of what's true/what M believes

M wrote a note: "Me offering support, what matters, what works"
