# Gottman journaling: ebb/flow

What components it might have:

- Being able to meet a schedule
- Adjusting that schedule to have breaks between routine or boring tasks. Breaks need to be restoring, but not addictive/dissociative.
- Not having down time where I will fall into dissociative stuff.
- Having some social stuff and some flexibility.
- Attending to what I find restorative, which might include sensory stuff like bass, listening to music, going for walks.
