Things E can do to support M re ASL:
-- Try not to express anger when M brings the topic up
-- Listen to him talk
-- Help him make plans when he asks for advice

In the future if we think the other person is uncomfortable with a topic, we should bring it up in therapy and ask what's going on

When Elizabeth feels like Michael is expressing distress reminiscent of the electric shock thing: "What should I do / what do you need from me right now?" If Elizabeth feels uncomfortable checking in again or like it implies she's been bad to him, check in later. 
M is fine interacting with signing people if there's an interpreter; the issue is about communication not sign per se
Discussing one thing at a time is important for us, especially when dealing with difficult issues

To ease things when M complaining about work, he should: 
-- State intention
-- State what he wants E to do
-- Default time limit of 3 minutes, then E can ask if done / needs self-care

If Michael is having strong negative emotions or glaring at me etc I can say later I'll ask him what's going on for him so can he pay attention to it now

# Therapy notes from with Mario Wed Sep 7, 2022

each come up with 3 ideas for rest of game, then discuss them. with rationales

M can ask E as much as he wants about what E is up for and at some point we will discuss if it would be better to dial it back

M - broadcast with "standard checkin" vs "are you up for support"

talk about increasing social stuff and overlap that we might want to do together
