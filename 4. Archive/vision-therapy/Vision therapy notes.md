Esophoria occurs when the eyesâ€™ natural posture is to sit inward, or point slightly toward the nose.

Vision therapy to alleviate the symptoms of a phoria focuses on expanding the fusional vergence system.

If a person has a high esophoria, he or she will need to work on improving his or her negative fusional vergence range.

Basic exophorias will focus on activities to improve positive fusional vergence, basic esophorias will focus on activities to improve negative fusional vergence, and fusional vergence dysfunction patients will work on both!
