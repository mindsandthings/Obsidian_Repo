# 3 Advanced Exercises for Convergence and Divergence Insufficiency

by [Dr. Daniel Baruffi](https://wilmingtonfamilyeyecare.com/author/dr-daniel-baruffi/ "Posts by Dr. Daniel Baruffi")Sep 29, 2021

This is part 7 of the [vision therapy](https://wilmingtonfamilyeyecare.com/services/vision-therapy/) series and will focus on [vergence](https://wilmingtonfamilyeyecare.com/vergence-disorders-vt-part-5/) insufficiencies—Convergence Insufficiency and Divergence Insufficiency.

<a id="E49"></a>If you have not read the previous portions of the vision therapy <a id="E51"></a>series <a id="E53"></a>it is highly advisable that you check them out first as they cover basics not explained here.

## <a id="E55"></a>Convergence Insufficiency

<a id="E57"></a>If you will recall, convergence insufficiency is the inability for one or both eye(s) to converge appropriately to a given target.

<a id="E59"></a>This means the eyes do not like to move inward toward the nose and is problematic when trying to look at a near target.

<a id="E61"></a>In some circumstances, individuals with convergence insufficiency will also suffer from high exophoria or [exotropia](https://wilmingtonfamilyeyecare.com/understanding-strabismus-and-lazy-eye/), meaning the eyes like to sit in an outward position.

<a id="E63"></a>Patients with [convergence insufficiency](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2772629) will often complain of [eye strain](https://wilmingtonfamilyeyecare.com/common-causes-of-eye-strain/) when looking at near objects (reading, writing, computer work, etc.), [headaches](https://wilmingtonfamilyeyecare.com/headaches-and-eyestrain/), double vision at near, eye fatigue, and sometimes avoidance of near tasks all together.

<a id="E65"></a>In many cases, individuals with convergence insufficiency will notice that their symptoms worsen as they get tired or after attempting to do near tasks for a prolonged <a id="E67"></a>period of time<a id="E69"></a>.

<a id="E71"></a>Individuals with convergence insufficiency often have a low AC/A ratio and a low near point of convergence.

<a id="E73"></a>Therapy will aim at increasing positive fusional vergence ranges to help strengthen the fusional vergence system and make near tasks more tolerable.

## <a id="E75"></a>Divergence Insufficiency

<a id="E77"></a>[Divergence insufficiency is the opposite problem](https://www.reviewofophthalmology.com/article/divergence-insufficiency-an-ongoing-challenge#:~:text=Patients%20with%20DI%20typically%20complain,headaches%20or%20sensitivity%20to%20light.) of convergence insufficiency. In divergence insufficiency, one or both eye(s) <a id="E79"></a>are <a id="E81"></a>unable to diverge appropriately to a given target.

<a id="E83"></a>This means the eyes do not like to move outward toward the ears and is problematic when trying to view a distant target.

<a id="E85"></a>In some circumstances, individuals with divergence insufficiency will also suffer from high esophoria or [esotropia](https://wilmingtonfamilyeyecare.com/understanding-strabismus-and-lazy-eye/), meaning the eyes like to sit in an inward position.

<a id="E87"></a>Patients with divergence insufficiency <a id="E88"></a>may complain of intermittent double vision (diplopia) when looking at something in the distance, frequent “wandering” of the eyes, headaches, motion sickness, and eye fatigue that comes and goes and can vary from day-to-day depending on how tired the individual is.

<a id="E90"></a>Individuals with divergence insufficiency often have a low AC/A ratio with a high near point of convergence.

<a id="E92"></a>Therapy will aim at increasing negative fusional vergence ranges to strengthen the fusional vergence system and <a id="E94"></a>help <a id="E95"></a>make average daily distance tasks more manageable with less frequent symptoms.

## <a id="E97"></a>Therapy Exercises

<a id="E99"></a>The exercises for divergence and converg<a id="E100"></a>ence <a id="E101"></a>insufficiencies are very similar in <a id="E103"></a>structure, but <a id="E105"></a>fine-tuned to work on strengthening either negative fusional vergence or positive fusional vergence.

<a id="E107"></a>To begin therapy, many therapists will focus first on normalizing the accommodative system. In many individuals with [vergence problems](https://wilmingtonfamilyeyecare.com/vergence-disorders-vt-part-5/), [accommodation will be worked on first to ensure it is equal between the two eyes](https://wilmingtonfamilyeyecare.com/eye-accommodation-disorders-vt-series-part-3/).

<a id="E109"></a>Normalizing accommodation is important because <a id="E110"></a>the accommodative and vergence systems are tightly correlated. In fact, when the vergence system is struggling, the accommodative system often picks up the slack and becomes overworked, which can also play a role in some of the symptoms of eye strain, fatigue, and headaches.

<a id="E112"></a>Vision therapy exercises aimed at strengthening and normalizing accommodation can be found in Part 4 of this series.

<a id="E114"></a>From there, [basic vergence exercises will be added in](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2772629). Some of the most common introductory exercises for vergence insufficiencies include Brock String, Barrel Cards, Stick-In-Straw, and Lifesaver cards.

<a id="E116"></a>These exercises were discussed in detail in Part 6 of this series.

<a id="E118"></a>More advanced exercises for vergence insufficiencies include <a id="E120"></a>Vectograms<a id="E122"></a>, <a id="E124"></a>Tranaglyphs<a id="E126"></a>, and Stereoscopes.

## <a id="E129"></a>Vectograms

<a id="E132"></a>A <a id="E134"></a>V<a id="E135"></a>ectogram <a id="E137"></a>is a <a id="E138"></a>tool which utilizes <a id="E139"></a>specialized imag<a id="E140"></a>ing <a id="E141"></a>along with the fusional vergence system to create a 3-D object.

<a id="E143"></a>The <a id="E144"></a>patient places two <a id="E145"></a>t<a id="E146"></a>ransparent <a id="E147"></a>cards <a id="E148"></a>into the <a id="E150"></a>vectogram <a id="E152"></a>system. Each <a id="E153"></a>card contains <a id="E154"></a>a partial view of the complete image.

<a id="E156"></a>The patient will wear a pair of polarizing [glasses](https://wilmingtonfamilyeyecare.com/how-to-choose-the-right-pair-of-glasses/) (<a id="E158"></a>similar to <a id="E160"></a>what is worn in <a id="E161"></a>modern <a id="E162"></a>3-D movies) to create depth within the image <a id="E163"></a>(stereopsis)<a id="E164"></a>.

<a id="E166"></a>Between the polarizing glasses and the patient’s fusional vergence system, he or she will be asked to either converge or diverge to fuse the two partial images into one 3-D image.

<a id="E168"></a>If the patient is only using one eye—the image will not be formed correctly. Therefore, it forces the patient to use both eyes properly to see the image.

<a id="E171"></a>Vectograms <a id="E173"></a>use an approach called the SILO affect to work on increasing divergence or convergence ranges.

<a id="E175"></a>To increase convergence, the two <a id="E176"></a>cards <a id="E177"></a>will be pushed inward, making the image smaller <a id="E178"></a>(Small <a id="E180"></a>In <a id="E182"></a>for the SI in SILO).

<a id="E184"></a>To increase divergence, the two <a id="E186"></a>cards <a id="E187"></a>will be pulled outward, making the image larger <a id="E188"></a>(Large Out for the LO in SILO).

<a id="E190"></a>Increasing or decreasing the distance between the two <a id="E191"></a>cards <a id="E192"></a>and asking the patient to converge or diverge will work on the focusing system and expand the eyes’ abilities to converge or diverge—hence helping with an insufficiency problem.

<a id="E194"></a>Therapists can make this activity more advanced by increasing the amount the <a id="E195"></a>cards <a id="E196"></a>are moved (<a id="E198"></a>i.e. <a id="E200"></a>changing the target) or by using multiple <a id="E202"></a>vectograms <a id="E204"></a>and making the patient look from one to another and quickly adapting the vergence system appropriately to each target (this is called “jumping” <a id="E206"></a>vectograms<a id="E208"></a>).

## <a id="E211"></a>Tranaglyphs

<a id="E215"></a>Tranaglyphs <a id="E217"></a>are <a id="E219"></a>similar to  <a id="E223"></a>vectograms<a id="E225"></a>, however instead of there being two different transparent image <a id="E226"></a>cards <a id="E227"></a>that need to be fused into one, there is one image <a id="E228"></a>card <a id="E229"></a>with a stereo image already pre-made onto the card.

<a id="E231"></a>This means that in a <a id="E233"></a>vectogram <a id="E235"></a>the amount of convergence or divergence needed to fuse the image depends <a id="E236"></a>solely <a id="E237"></a>upon how far apart the two cards are held<a id="E238"></a>, <a id="E240"></a>i.e. <a id="E242"></a>is “variable”<a id="E243"></a>. In a Tranaglyph, the amount of convergence or divergence needed to fuse the image is pre<a id="E244"></a>-determined, <a id="E246"></a>i.e. <a id="E248"></a>is “fixed”.

<a id="E250"></a>If you can remember the old newspaper comics that had a green image with a red image overlying it  <a id="E252"></a>that would turn into a 3-D image if you put on red/blue 3-D glasses—<a id="E254"></a>tranaglyphs <a id="E256"></a>are made similarly.

<a id="E258"></a>In this exercise, the patient is asked to wear a pair of red/green glasses—one eye sees <a id="E260"></a>red <a id="E262"></a>and the other eye sees green.

<a id="E264"></a>When looking at the image on the card, patients will be required to use their fusional vergence system to fuse the red and green images into one 3-D image.

<a id="E266"></a>Different cards with different images will require different amount<a id="E267"></a>s <a id="E268"></a>of negative and positive fusional vergence.

<a id="E270"></a>Patients will be able to work on fusing the images of one <a id="E271"></a>card and <a id="E272"></a>move on to a more difficult <a id="E273"></a>card <a id="E274"></a>as their fusional vergence ranges expand.

## <a id="E276"></a>Stereoscope

<a id="E278"></a>A stereoscope is a tool used to help expand fusional vergence ranges once a baseline has been established.

<a id="E280"></a>The mirror stereoscope is one of the <a id="E282"></a>most commonly used <a id="E284"></a>types. It involves a <a id="E285"></a>specialty [optical](https://wilmingtonfamilyeyecare.com/services/optical-dispensing/) <a id="E286"></a>system and a <a id="E287"></a>uniquely <a id="E288"></a>created image book. The tool itself can be calibrated to work on increasing divergence or convergence, depending on <a id="E289"></a>what <a id="E290"></a>it is set to.

<a id="E292"></a>The patient looks into the stereoscope to see two images—the right eye will see one image and the left eye will see the other. For example, the right eye might see a lion while the left eye sees a cage.

<a id="E294"></a>In this example, the patient will be asked to either relax his or her eyes to put the lion in the cage (diverge) or stimulate his or her eyes to put the lion in the cage (converge).

<a id="E296"></a>Once the two images have been combined into one, the patient will be asked to hold the image in place for 10-15 seconds.

<a id="E299"></a>Once this can be repeated multiple times, the amount of required divergence or convergence can be increased, thus expanding the vergence range and strengthening the problem area.

<a id="E301"></a>Like the previously mentioned exercises, stereoscope exercises can also be made more complex as therapy advances.
