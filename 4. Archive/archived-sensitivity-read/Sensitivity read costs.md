# Sensitivity read costs
$150 Boy called Bat (kids' book/pamphlet) 
$150 for a sensitivity read for the follow-up (I think?) 
$250 for another sensitivity read, no 1099

The previous sensitivity read I did was $250 for a 75k-word manuscript and I provided a three-page write-up and some comments in the manuscript. 

The slack also says $250 for 60-100k is a pretty common amount.
