# Bass notes

**Hi, Noe.You're doing fine with "Sweet Jane."  I encourage you to sometimes practice with all of the ghost strums and counting, then sometimes practice just by imitation.  Those two skills will begin to unite as you progress.I think what we need to do is get through a variety of different strum patterns so you can exercise those skills outside of the context of just one song.  I've attached the 2/4 and 6/8 time strum patterns we played today.  Follow the down and up strum markings, and your "ghost" strums will show up automatically for these two patterns.Thanks, have a great week.

start at 60, go up in 10s to 90 etcNice work with your chords so far. I've attached the strum pattern that we worked on today - that's patter #1 on the worksheet with the arrows. Please practice any chords you'd like with this pattern, and remember to do those "ghost" strums like you mean 'em. I've also attached the C, G, and D strumming worksheet. The rhythm you see is the same strum pattern as the one from the other worksheet (pattern #1). You may practice the part at measures 4-7, then at meas. 8-11.Thanks for the song list, will look it over and pick one.
Hi, Noe.Nice work with that first handful of licks from "Tulip."  While tuned 1/2 step down, the song is in the key of Am (relative to the dropped tuning, actual pitch G#).  We're pretty much hanging out on E, A, and B with a couple of fills.We're about halfway through the song so far.  Let's see if there's any other parts next time and maybe jam on it a bit.Thanks, have a great week.
Hi, Noe.Today, we went through that F#m B E A progression the following ways:1) straight root notes (1/8th notes)2) 4 root notes, 4 major or minor thirds (8th notes)3) root, 3rd, 5th, octave for each chordI will look over your list of songs and we can jump into something next lesson.Thanks, have a great week.Em

Hi, Noe.It was great to hear you stepping into that rhythmic backbone bassist role today.  That will happen more and more, as you learn these common chord progressions and strategies.Today, we played a ii V I IV chord progression - that was F#m, B, E, A.Start with root notes, of course, then try using the major and minor thirds.  The accent notes for the rhythm we used were at beat 1, the & of 2, and beat 4.  This gives us a simple, syncopated feel:1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &...Have a great week, see you next time.Em
Hi, Noe.Thank you for letting me know one of the topics you've been struggling with, so we can focus on refining that skill in lessons.  I think what you need is more experience playing "target" notes over common chord progressions.  This will ultimately empower you to find "correct" notes and use them effectively.  Let's continue to keep it simple right now - one common chord progression at a time, with one or two target notes per chord, with one or two simple rhythms.The very common progression we played today was:| C | G | Am | F | or, the I, V, vi, IV progression.  It's the "No Woman No Cry" or "Let It Be" progression.We also doubled the chords for a different take:| C | C | G | G | Am | Am | F | F |Start by finding only the root notes, in one place on the fretboard.  Play only those 4 notes - 2 half-notes per measure.Thanks, and I look forward to more of these in upcoming lessons.Em
Hi, Noe.
Good jamming today. I encourage you to use the "My Favorite...." TAB (and most TABs, for that matter) as a reference for your own interpretation of a song. With a chord-focused song like this one, it's great to see what notes the bassist hits between root notes - to give you ideas for improvised fills. This song has a lot of added notes that we've praticed in other contexts, like major or minor thirds, octaves, and chromatic runs.
I encourage you to continue practicing with the YouTube version slowed down, but look at the chords version of the sheet music (not the TAB) and get creative.
Thanks, and have a great week.

Hi, Noe.
Nice grooving today. Keep playing along with "My Favorite Mistake," and try to stay with the drummer, and/or in the "pocket." You can do this by playing the exact bass part, or you can add some of those "walking" notes, or change up the rhythm a little... get creative and see what your own interpretation of the part might be.
Thanks, have a great week.

Walkin cane with the longer rhythmMy Favorite Mistake - follow along on root noteshttps://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/sheryl-crow/my-favorite-mistake-chords-65351Nice jamming today on the "Walkin' Cane" chord cycle. I encourage you to keep jamming with the song, so you can continue to develop your "feel." This is about as informal a genre as genres get, so forget about the theory and technical stuff, and just try to lock into the groove. Use the kick drum as your guide.
I pasted the chords I found for "My Favorite Mistake."  For now, you can see if you can grab root notes on time, then we'll pick it up again next lesson.

the rhythms are "sight-reading-mastery-"Hi, Noe.The rhythms we exercised today were the 5th and 6th lines from the top of that page I attached to your last lesson.  One way to cycle those is to hit the root notes of one chord per measure: | A | D  | E | A |, like we did today.  The next step for that would be to hit the root note of each chord during the first half of each measure, then the major third in the second half.  That way, we're challenged to keep the rhythm correct, while knowing exactly which beat we're on, despite any rhythmic cues (or lack thereof).We also went over example 1D from the "Groove" book, and moved it to a second position.  (screenshot attached)I'd love to help you learn a song next, since we haven't done that in a while.  Send me some suggestions and we'll start one next time.Happy New Year!Em**

Hi, Noe.

I've attached a PDF of the rhythm exercises we were working on today - the ones toward the end of the page with 1/8th notes are from today. \[in sight-reading-mastery-bass-guitar\

Try cycling that rhythm through a set of chords (hitting only the root note, or third, or some other important note per chord). You can also try taking two measures or so of any rhythm, and try playing it with the notes from a scale, choosing different patterns of notes. See if you come up with some melodies you like.

Thanks, and have a great week.

Hi, Noe.

Nice work so far with the sight-reading exercise from pg. 31. Challenge yourself to add accents to small segments of the piece, like 3 or 4 measures at a time. First, accent beat 1 of each measure. Next, beats 1 and 3. Then, 1 and 4; then 2 and 4. Remember that rest strokes are louder than free strokes. Challenge yourself to different tempos.

I've attached the page from the "groove" book that we worked on today. Work on counting that out and getting good timing.

I'd love to keep working out of the sight reading book, and if you're interested in the others, here are the links:

Hi, Noe.

Today's jam was a minor i, iv, v progression in A minor (the relative minor to C major). The progression is: | Am | Dm | Em | Am | repeat

The next step, which we can jam more on next time, is to play progressions with both major and minor chords. This is a more pop/rock/songwriter style than the last 2 "bluesy" ones:

| C | Dm | G | Am | repeat

I'd lean toward saying this is in the key of Am, not Cmaj. That's only because it ends with Am. Between the starting and ending chords, the ending one is a bit more of a giveaway as to what key you're using. That's our "resolve" spot.

Thanks, and I look forward to more next time.

Hi, Noe.

Seems like you're gaining some confidence with the 12-bar-blues jamming. Practice the A blues, and a metronome, counting out loud, and/or the video I made of my guitar track may help.

You may work on the minor 7th arpeggio as well, and we'll explore a different song structure/chord progression next time.

Thanks, have a great week.

Em

Hi, Noe.

I've attached the bass arpeggio worksheet - I recently added the 7th chords to it, and I'm not sure if you have this updated copy yet.

Today, we played the 12-bar-blues in A major, using the dominant 7th arpeggio. The progression is:

| A | D | A | A |

| D | D | A | A |

| E | D | A | E | repeat.

The 12-bar blues chords are I, IV, and V. So, for the key of A major, the chords are:

A Bm C#m D E F#m G#dim

Since the notes in the A major scale are A B C# D E F# G#, the notes in the dominant 7th arpeggio will be A(1) C#(3) E(5) and F(lowered 7th)

Hi, Noe.
You've got the TAB reading down very well so far with "Amazing Grace."  Here are some tips for practice:

- maybe hammer-on the lower/fretted notes instead of plucking, for lower volume
- treble up, bridge pickup, pick close to the bridge to get those harmonics to stand out
    -  Use free-form timing, practice technical stuff until you feel good enough about it that you can get more into the feel/emotion of the song.
    Thanks, and have a great week.

Hi, Noe.
Here's that video for "Amazing Grace" - https://youtu.be/NaxrCS21_cs
We covered all of what is labeled "Part 1" in the TAB so far.  I couldn't find the TAB from the video (it doesn't appear to be in the links supplied by the video's creator), the video pretty much follows the TAB you already have.
Thanks, happy harmonics.
