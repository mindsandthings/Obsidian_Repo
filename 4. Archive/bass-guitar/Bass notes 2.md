# Bass notes

Strategies for creating bass lines, if you know the chord progression
1) just root notes
2) root, 3rd (like in "New Year's Day")
3) root, 5th (like in "Thibodaux Furlough")
4) scale notes
5) the arpeggios, which cut to the chase and give you root, 3rd, and 5th.

Finding all chords in a key
1. if you know the key you can play an arpeggio off each note in the scale. but which arpeggio you play depends on the position in the scale. if it's a major key you are playing them as major minor minor major major minor dimished. 
2. for each chord you get the next 2 notes - they are the scale degree plus two (i.e. third and fifth counting that note as 1). because of half steps this means some are major and some are minor. if it has a half step this means it's a minor chord because of the third being a half step down i.e. 1 finger down. diminished chords are for the 7th note of the scale because it has two minor chords in it. 
3. sometimes you will only get the key and a recording when people want you to make a bass line and this will help you narrow down what chords there are to just 7 chords. 
Step 1: build the scale
Step 2: assign the chord qualities
Step 3: use major third/minor third technique to form your bass line.


Stuff I can practice
•	Scales (minor pent, maj pent, nat maj, nat min, blues)
•	Arpeggios
⁃	Major Arpeggio = the 1, 3, 5 of the major scale, and the notes that when played together make a major chord. 
⁃	Minor Arpeggio = the 1, 3, 5 of the natural minor scale, and the notes that when played together make a minor chord. 
⁃	Diminished Arpeggio
•	Review roots, fifths, and thirds:
⁃	Fifth above (maj and min): 1 string up and 2 frets up (5th below: 1 string down same fret)
⁃	Third (minor): 1 string up and 2 frets down (or 3 frets up)
⁃	Third (major): 1 string up and 1 fret down
⁃	 Octave: 2 strings up 2 notes up
•	Gun in My Hand – make a cheat sheet
•	Thibodaux Furlough – finish up cheat sheet
•	New Dawn Coming –  make a cheat sheet; do full speed with and without music
•	Common Disaster - practice full speed with and without music
•	Seven Nation Army - full speed with and without music



Glad we got to put some of your new theory knowledge into action today.  The chord progression is: ii, viidim, I, IV in the key of Bb: Cm, Adim, Bb, Eb.
I’ve recorded today's chord progression.  Practice that with the thirds technique, then see if you can branch out to a couple other techniques like scale notes and arpeggios.  I know the diminished chord is rather limited, but it'll be an interesting challenge to make that one sound musical.

Bb C D Eb F G A Bb
_______________
Thirds
Cm 3rds: C Eb   (3 1)  (8th pos E string, 6th pos A string)
Adim 3rds: A Eb (1 2) (5th pos E string, 6th A string)
Bb 3rds: Bb D (2 1) (6th pos E string, 5th pos E string) 
Eb 3rds: Eb G (2 1) (6th A string, 5th D string)

Scale notes 
Bb C D Eb F G A Bb

Cm: C D (3rd pos 1 3) 
Adim: A D (3rd pos 3 3) other options not 3 5: D, Bb, G
Bb: Bb Eb (4th pos 3 3) (alts not 3 5: G, A)
Eb: Eb C (6th pos 1, 3)
__________________________
Arpeggios
Cm (1, b3, 5): C Eb G
Adim (1, b3, b5): A C Eb
Bb (1, 3, 5): Bb, D, F
Eb (1, 3, 5): Eb, G, Bb
 



Hi, Noe.

Here's the instructional video that will help you with the "Ultimate Warmup" we did today: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6nI-K4MKOs

Also, I've attached the sheet music.

It was fun starting "She's Your Cocaine" today.  I look forward to exploring that one further with you.

Thanks, and have a great week.

Hi, Noe.

Here's a summary of that practice drill we did today.  First, we built a key and chose 4 chords from it.  Those were  D, Em, A, and Bm (a I ii V vi progression in D major).  Then, for exactly two measures each chord, you got to be creative and write a bass line the following ways:

1) "Beginner" (just root notes)

2) "Intermediate" (just root notes and maj or min thirds)

3) "Advanced" (choose a few notes from the maj or min scale)

If the intermediate and advanced ways are still tricky, you can set a metronome and continue to practice them at a slow tempo over the same chords or even just 2 chords at a time.

Let's pick up where we left off next time with "She's Your Cocaine."  This is the live version we were working with: https://open.spotify.com/track/1mTioruEDnKy3mNmfn49pc and here are the chords (though, the live version is 1/2 step lower than this): https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tori-amos/shes-your-cocaine-chords-...

So far, we've just got the Bb and Eb lick.  Remember, it's the root note, then the "pop" picking technique to hammer on to the root note an octave higher.

Thanks, and have a great week.

Bass:
* find improv parts on She's Your Cocaine
* improv using minor pentatonic notes in 7th position
* practice the 2 improv parts she showed me: 1-3-1-3 (D-E-D-B; 7th pos for the lead-in) and rest-C#D
* -D# -E (chromatic scale; no 7th-pos for the lead-in, just a rest)
* practice the bit at the end (B D EE? with E on 2nd string and 4th string). Listen to song for rhythm.
* do the ultimate warmup all 2-3 up then down; after that, do all 2-4 up then down
* Listen to Raspberry Swirl. Practice: 3 3 3 3 3-1 3 3 3 3 3-1 3 3 3 etc. Not sure which key? I forgot.

Hi, Noe.
Here's the chord chart I found for "Raspberry Swirl."  For now, you can practice that first riff - it's based on finding the Bb note on your 4th string, then going between that and the minor third (4th fret 3rd string).  That is also the same as the first 2 notes of the Bb minor pentatonic scale.
Nice work with "She's Your Cocaine." Not much to add there except for those two improvvy fill licks I showed you, and that ending part (but the B note is an octave higher than the recording because we don't have a 5th string).
Thanks, and enjoy your weekend.

Hi, Noe.
Keep practicing that main riff of "She's Your Cocaine" (in B if you'd like - you don't have to do the A# version).  Work on smoothing out the transition between normal picking and the "popping."  Attached videos will help.
Remember that a lot of the bass line is improvised.  However, what I've shown you so far is the basis upon which everything else is created.  It's the basic part, but once you feel more confident you may elaborate creatively upon it.
Thanks, and enjoy your weekend.

Hi, Noe.

Glad to have you back in lessons today.  Let's make it a goal to play through some of "Raspberry Swirl" next time - I'll play the guitar part so you can have that jamming experience.

I'd like to do more jamming in lessons so you can at least get a little experience playing with others.  I know it's not as great as being in person (with the quirks of Zoom and all), but at least it's some experience.

Let's jam on that E, C#m, A, and B chord progression more as well.  Today we played just root notes, then the first 4 notes of each pentatonic scale.

Thanks, have a great week.

Em
p[ick some songs for to play with her
open jams
slowing down a youtube video fo it to 25% or 50%
get a drumbeat app and play along to it on progressions
look for somethign that does chords

I didn't find a version of New Speedway Boogie that I liked that had a more interesting bass line so here is a list of other songs:

Hi, Noe.

Here's the link to the Songsterr tab for "Faded." https://www.songsterr.com/a/wsa/ben-harper-faded-tab-s26553t1

We only got through the first 13 measures today. Remember, this is just a fancy way of illustrating a simple chord progression.  Look for familiar patterns, and slow it way down to catch the tricky timing.

Thanks, and have a great weekend.

Gorillaz - every planet we reach is dead - listen to song, memorize rhythm

Nice work getting through those first couple of A-string exercises in your book.  These exercises will of course help with rhythm and little details like the finer points of pick-hand technique.

Here's the link to the Gorillaz tune: https://www.songsterr.com/a/wsa/gorillaz-every-planet-we-reach-is-dead-b...  Let's pick it up at some of those higher-fret riffs next time.

In #67, try practicing the two spots where it changes time signature (the hardest spots - meas. 6-7 and 10-11) and branch out from there.  You can always do this as another practice strategy when learning challenging material.  You may also use alternate methods of rhythm counting when you're playing multiple time signatures: counting how many of the smallest division of the beat each note lasts, and/or just ignoring the time signature and going note by note.
