Next, I want to get you started *creating your own bass lines and grooves*. If your goal is to make music with anyone else, you'll probably have to come up with your own bass lines at some point.
 
This *doesn't* have to be complicated though! In fact, there's a *formula* you can use that works at least 80% of the time - I call it the 'Instant Bass Line Formula'.
 
 [Click Here For The Instant Bass Line Formula Lesson](https://becomeabassist.emlnk1.com/lt.php?s=73237194b611d951909ddb09d81acab5&i=548A579A2A10045) 
Add the lowest parts of the drums, and the root notes of the chord progression. If the drum notes are clustered, you can but don't have to change in the middle of the cluster
 
If you want to take the bass lines you make in this lesson to the next level, then you can check out  [Next Level Bass Lines](https://becomeabassist.emlnk1.com/lt.php?s=73237194b611d951909ddb09d81acab5&i=548A579A2A10046) .
 
 
Add to rhythms, then hang notes off those rhythms
(First find existing notes for a rhythm that works, then try changing the extra notes)
 
 
So once you're technique is solid and you're grooving hard, what's the 3rd step? It's developing your ability to *play by ear*.
 
Why is this important? Well if you can play by ear, you can do all kinds of things much more quickly and easily. You can learn songs without having to trawl through dozens of dodgy tab sites. You can come up with bass lines or melodies almost instantly.
 
At the highest levels, you can even play songs that you've never even heard before.
 
The fastest way to start leveling up your ear is to use your voice. Now I know what you're thinking, but don't worry; you don't have to be a good singer to start using your voice to train your ear.
 
I show you the process in this video. It's unbelievably simple to get started and will open up all kinds of ideas in your playing.
 
 [Start Training Your Ear With This Simple Process](https://becomeabassist.emlnk1.com/lt.php?s=73237194b611d951909ddb09d81acab5&i=548A579A2A11362) 
 
 
 
Now bass players are groove machines for about 95% of the time, right? So what can we do the other 5%? Well, you can do a ton of things! But the two most common are to *play fills*or create your own *bass solo*!
 
A lot of people kind of 'freeze up' when they get asked to do either of these things - or they end up just playing the same old thing they always do. And I get it - the idea of improvising can be *scary*!
 
Again though, it doesn't need to be! Improvising can actually be one of the*most satisfying* and *most fun* parts of playing bass and I want to share with you an incredibly easy way to get started.
 
How easy is it? Well you *don't* need to know a ton of scales, shapes, licks or theory - all you need is your bass and a willingness to try a slightly different approach.

Now I've just given you a ton of stuff and I'm sure you'll learn a lot as you go through all of it. But if some questions come up, I totally understand.
 
If you have any questions about these lessons or anything else bass-related, just send me a quick email. I'd be more than happy to help however I can.
 
Thanks again for requesting the BAB Beginners Starter Pack. It's really great to have you on board. I'll make sure to keep working hard to make sure there's a ton of value in every video I send you. In the meantime, enjoy the lessons in the starter pack.
 
 
Now we bass players don't usually get to mess around with bass chords. Most of the time, it's the guitarists and keys players who have that job.
 
But chords on bass sound fantastic - and very few people ever really take the time to figure out how to play them!
 
It can be a little tricky to play chords on bass without them sounding muddy, but that's exactly what you'll learn how to do in Bass Chord Pro.
 
 [Lesson 1 - The Major Chord](https://becomeabassist.emlnk1.com/lt.php?s=73237194b611d951909ddb09d81acab5&i=537A568A2A9983) 
 
In this first lesson, you'll learn the biggest mistakes that bass players make when they go to play bass chords, and you'll learn what to do instead to get crystal-clear, mud-free bass chords.
 
Underneath the lesson, you'll find a PDF chart that shows you exactly how to play every single major chord on your bass as well as some 'shell-voicings' which are even easier.
 
 [Lesson 2 - Inversions Of Major Chords](https://becomeabassist.emlnk1.com/lt.php?s=73237194b611d951909ddb09d81acab5&i=537A568A2A9984) 
 
In lesson #2, you're going to be learning about the process of 'inverting' all of your chords. This basically means turning the chord upside down.
 
It's great because you get to use the same notes, but the chords sound completely different. I love the '1st inversion' major chords - they're just so pretty!
 
 [Lesson 3 - Minor Chords and their Inversions](https://becomeabassist.emlnk1.com/lt.php?s=73237194b611d951909ddb09d81acab5&i=531A562A2A9961) 
In this lesson, we're dealing with some different kinds of chords. You've most likely dealt with them before, but this lesson, you're going to get THE comprehensive method for creating and playing minor chords PLUS their inversions.
There's a PDF chart you can download underneath the lesson that lays everything out for you on your fretboard. Again, we're going to be playing these chords so we avoid that 'mudiness' and play these chords so they sound crystal clear.
In Lesson 4, we're going to start dealing with a more complex chord - the major 7th chord. Don't worry though, the Bass Chord Pro system makes it simple to build and play these chords.
 
 [Lesson 4 - The Major 7th Chord](https://becomeabassist.emlnk1.com/lt.php?s=73237194b611d951909ddb09d81acab5&i=531A562A2A9962) 
 
Again, there's a PDF chart that you can use to find all of your major 7th chords absolutely everywhere on your bass.
 
're still dealing with 4-note chords in lesson #5, so the chords are still a little complex, but once again, if you know the formulas, it's a piece of cake.
 
Check it out here:
 
 [Bass Chord Pro Lesson Five](https://becomeabassist.emlnk1.com/lt.php?s=73237194b611d951909ddb09d81acab5&i=532A563A2A9965) 
 
You'll learn how to create the minor 7th chord as well as how to make a type 1 and type 2 chord.
 
There's a sneaky little trick that you can use to easily and quickly make these chords that you don't even need to think about - and I love making things automatic.
Making it automatic frees up your mind so you can focus on making the best music you can.
 
#####
 
In lesson #6, we're going to be talking about a very specific kind of chord. In a way, it's a mix of major and minor.
 
You'll find these chords everywhere. I explain just one place where we can use our type 1 and type 2 chords in the lesson, but there are plenty more!
 
Check out the lesson here:
 
 [Bass Chord Pro Lesson 6 - The Dominant Chord](https://becomeabassist.emlnk1.com/lt.php?s=73237194b611d951909ddb09d81acab5&i=532A563A2A9966) 
 
Once again, there are new PDF charts with all the chords you could ever hope to need in type 1 shapes and type 2 shapes for both lessons.
 
Next lesson, we're putting it all together! We'll be creating and 'voicing' one of the most common chord progressions in modern music.
 
 
 
P.S. Thanks again for subscribing Elizabeth - I really do appreciate it.
 
Cheers,
 
in lesson #7, we're dealing with one of the most common chord progressions in modern music. I guarantee you've heard it hundreds or possibly thousands of times before.
 
After this lesson, you'll be able to recognize and play the progression in both type 1 and type 2 positions - in a way that's really quite beautiful.
 
And the best part - it's a simple formula that will let you 'plug and play' and sound great every time.
 
Check it out here:
 
 [Bass Chord Pro - Putting It All Together](https://becomeabassist.emlnk1.com/lt.php?s=73237194b611d951909ddb09d81acab5&i=533A564A2A9969)

So far, you've learned a whole ton about chords and how to play them on your bass so they sound amazing!
 
Honestly, if you've been keeping up with these lessons and really learning about these chords, you'll know more than 90-95% of other bass players.
 
This final lesson though will shoot your knowledge of bass chords into the stratosphere!
 
We'll be covering 3 different kinds of chords in this one lesson - it's pretty packed.
 
You'll learn about diminished chords, augmented chords and I'll show you a little trick to make the chords you already know sound even better!
 
Now this lesson is pretty dense, and we'll be moving pretty quickly, so if you need to pause and let everything sink in, then go for it. Of course you can always rewind as well.

So today, I’m releasing the 3rd installment of my Beginner Bass Lines - Guaranteed To Impress series.
 
There are always tons of comments and emails from people asking me to show them beginner songs, so I scoured my emails and comments and found the most popular requests and put them into this video.
 
Check out the lesson here:
 
 

 [Check out the lesson here](https://becomeabassist.emlnk1.com/lt.php?s=73237194b611d951909ddb09d81acab5&i=964A1028A2A12309) 
 
When I made the first video in this series, I never really expected it would be quite as popular as it turned out, so if you have beginner songs that you think would fit the bill, just let me know! (But no - Primus bass lines do NOT fit the bill)
 
As an email subscriber, you have access to all the extra bonuses for the videos, so here’s the PDF with all the tabs and notation for these beginner bass lines:
 
 [https://becomeabassist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Beginner-Bass-Lines-Volume-3.pdf](https://becomeabassist.emlnk1.com/lt.php?s=73237194b611d951909ddb09d81acab5&i=964A1028A2A12310) 

You'll be learning not one, but *two* ways of using your right hand to get these chords out out of your bass and into the world.

One is soft and mellow, the other one is strong and percussive.

And don't worry - if you're unsure about which method you should use, I'll show you a question that you can ask yourself that will give you the answer every time.
 [Bass Chord Pro - How To Use Your Right Hand](https://becomeabassist.emlnk1.com/lt.php?s=73237194b611d951909ddb09d81acab5&i=534A565A2A9973)

Another question that gets asked a lot about all the Bass Chord material is *where* it can be used. You already know *how*to use bass chords, but does that mean you can go around putting them in everywhere?

Well it's not that simple...

If you're just playing by yourself, then yes. You can go *crazy* with the chords! Put them anywhere and everywhere!

But if you're playing with other people, you *_need_* to be more careful with all this stuff. If you're not, the music can end up in a big muddy *mess* and you'll certainly *annoy* the people you're playing with.

Trust me - you don't want to be that guy on stage that everyone is*annoyed and frustrated* with...

In  [this lesson](https://becomeabassist.emlnk1.com/lt.php?s=73237194b611d951909ddb09d81acab5&i=534A565A2A9974) , you'll learn 4 places where the chords you play will sound really good, and the one place you should *avoid* playing chords.

You'll also learn about the general guidelines that will help you develop a *'sixth sense'* for when you should play chords.
