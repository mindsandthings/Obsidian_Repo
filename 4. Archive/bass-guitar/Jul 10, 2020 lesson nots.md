# Jul 10, 2020 lesson nots

Hi, Noe.
Here are the main points from your mini theory lesson today:
Major Arpeggio = the 1, 3, 5 of the major scale, and the notes that when played together make a major chord. 
Minor Arpeggio = the 1, 3, 5 of the natural minor scale, and the notes that when played together make a minor chord. 
Your strategies for writing bass lines over maj and/or min chords (or your go-to tricks to figuring out already-written bass lines): 
1) root notes
2) root and minor or major third
3) root and 5th
4) root and octave
5) scales
6) root-3rd-5th (arpeggios)
I hope this can help you make the connection to learning the very complex "Thibodaux Furlough" bass line.  Practice the first 12 measures or so, and remember, it's outlining an Fsharp m, Cm, Csharp, F sharp m chord progression.
Thanks, and have a great week.
