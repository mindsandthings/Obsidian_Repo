# Archived bass lesson notes


Hi, Noe.
You've got the TAB reading down very well so far with "Amazing Grace."  Here are some tips for practice:
- maybe hammer-on the lower/fretted notes instead of plucking, for lower volume
- treble up, bridge pickup, pick close to the bridge to get those harmonics to stand out
-  Use free-form timing, practice technical stuff until you feel good enough about it that you can get more into the feel/emotion of the song.
Thanks, and have a great week.


Hi, Noe.
Here's that video for "Amazing Grace" - https://youtu.be/NaxrCS21_cs
We covered all of what is labeled "Part 1" in the TAB so far.  I couldn't find the TAB from the video (it doesn't appear to be in the links supplied by the video's creator), the video pretty much follows the TAB you already have.
Thanks, happy harmonics.

Hi, Noe.
I am very impressed, and super proud of what you've done with study #10.  Congrats on completing it.
Sorry we didn't get to "Amazing Grace" today, will cover in the coming lessons.
For now, you may practice that note + harmonic drill I showed you, which is one of many things that can help you with playing non-harmonic and harmonic notes in the same song.  We see that all over the place in the 10 studies, and in Victor Wooten's material.  
We started with the root and 3rd of each chord in the key of C major.  Then, we played the 3rd as a harmonic, having the picking hand follow the harmonic notes (12 frets up from the fret-hand) up the strings of the bass.
The chords are: C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am Bdim (do a minor third for this one), and C.  Play the root note (non-harmonic) at the 3rd string.  Play the 3rd as a harmonic at the 2nd string.
Thanks, to be continued....
Take care.
Hi, Noe.

For the last 3 lines of study #10, I suggest back-chaining about 1 or 1/2 measure at a time.  Nice work finding the fretboard positioning, the only thing left is to go through the tedious repetition and string it all together.

For "Amazing Grace," practice making that "power chord" shape for the groove in "part 2" of the song.  Practice just the C and G power chords (no harmonics), then add the B octave shape in-between, like I showed you today.  If those power chord and/or octave shapes are super hard, try them at higher fretboard positions as a practice drill.

Just a reminder, there are no lessons next Fri 9/3.

Thanks, and have a great couple of weeks.


Hi, Noe.
You're doing great with study #10.  For that last line or two, maybe find all of the notes as non-harmonics, just to get the fretboard positioning first.  Then, turn that top line into harmonics.  Stay on your bridge pickup with the treble turned up for punchy harmonics.
I'd love to work on 3 key areas of bass playing with you in the coming lessons:
1) physical/technical exercises
2) jamming/improv
3) I'll dig around and see what other standard notation studies and pieces I can find
Also, I've found a pretty good TAB of the main parts of Victor Wooten's "Amazing Grace."  I'll attach it to today's lesson.
Thanks, have a great week.

I think you've learned some fantastic skills from the "10 Studies," like crazy-difficult note reading, fretboard positioning, and time signatures.  Though I have my gripes about how the studies are written, I think you've gotten what you needed out of them.  I commend you for taking on such a difficult task.
Take a look at what A. Brink is doing in the video for #10.  I'll leave it up to you as to whether or not you want to tackle that one.  If you do, I suggest learning the notes "as is" first (as notes, not harmonics), and maybe play each phrase on only one string.  That way, you can just follow the halfway point between the fretted note and the bridge of your bass to get the harmonics.
Just a reminder - no Friday lessons next week.  See you in 2 wks.

Hi, Noe.
Let's re-visit the bass studies in the next couple of lessons if you'd like.
In the meantime, keep working on the two jamming progressions:
1) "Copperhead Road"-style: | D | D | D | D | G | G | D | D | repeat
2) "Hard Sun" style - | D | C | G | D | repeat
Today, we just did "Copperhead Road."  The strategies you used were:
1) root notes only, with a very simple rhythm, just to get oriented
2) root notes and the occasional 5th below D (A, at 5th fret 4th string), and the occasional 5th up from G (C)
3) root notes with some scale-based 3 or 4 note walking riffs
Thanks, hope you have a great weekend.

Hi, Noe.

Let's continue to work on your jamming skills, it will take time and many attempts.  You have the freedom to start just with root notes, and just by getting into the flow of  when each chord changes.  Don't try to put too much detail or creativity into what you're doing, just get your footing at first.

I think you can practice the two song-themed jams like this:

1) "Copperhead Road"-style: | D | D | D | D | G | G | D | D | repeat

2) "Hard Sun" style - | D | C | G | D | repeat

Thanks, and enjoy your weekend.  Just a reminder also that I am out of the office next week, so no lessons.

* Crossing exercise: 5, 6, 7, 8 up; 5, 6, 7, 8 down. Do 5 positions at start of session, a different 5 at the middle of the session, a different 5 at the end of the session
* Ultimate warmup: do 3 and 4 more than other fingers

For #10: for non-open string harmonics, fret an octave lower, hold down the note with the right-hand first finger, and pluck with the thumb

Hi, Noe.

Great work with study #7.   Looks like #8 is a little bit of a break from the super-complex stuff from the last couple studies!  The key there is going to be sustaining the long notes for as long as you can, hitting the correct notes confidently (since you have to make them last a long time), and adding things like vibrato.

Let's work on some jamming skills in one of your next lessons as well.  I'd like you to pick 3 simple songs that have 5 chords or less (you can google "easy guitar songs" or "4 chord guitar songs" or look at the "easy" skill level material at Ultimate-Guitar.com or Songsterr).  I want to work with you on jamming on some sections of those songs, to build your chops.

Thanks, and have a great week.

I commend you for working on such advanced material as study #7.  With that study, since you have to play in a couple of different octaves at once, there aren't many places you can play each measure.  You pretty much have one or two choices as to which frets to use, and they're not comfortable ones.  This will be particularly physically challenging.

I encourage you to use the back-chaining strategy.  For example, play measures 7 and 8 until you're comfortable.  Then, do 6/7 and 6/7/8.  Then 5/6, 5/6/7/8 and so on.

Thanks, and enjoy your weekend.

Places to look
Music stores (check for postings; "do you know about any open mics or open jams? I'm a bass player and might be looking to join a band")
Coffeeshops and bars with live usic - call up and ask if they have an open mic or an open jam


Look for
Open mics: these are often people on stage who've written their own material and are looking for a band
Open jams - their culture differs one to the other; good people will guide you back if you get lost. 

I'm new, I've been taking lessons for X time, I can jam on 3 or 4 chords.

* Find own songs - google for chords and bring printouts to the jam - do you know these, can you play them *

Google 3-chord songs for easy guitar

Can also suggest: standard jamming, e..g. G for X measures, D for Y measures, C for Z measures, then repeat. Once they find the groove, branch out. 

Root, 5th, 3rd, etc. 

-------


Hi, Noe.

I hope you can find some open jams/people to jam with, now that COVID restrictions are lifting.  Some things you can play with others are:

2, 3, or 4 chords of your choice

3-chord songs like "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" and "Fade Into You"

Google "3 (or 4) chord songs for easy guitar" and you'll find a ton of material.  You can jam on just root notes, then branch out more as you become comfortable.

We can take a look at study #7 and whatever else you'd like in the coming lessons.  Have a great week.


Hi, Noe.

I really like some of the choices you made in #6, in order to keep the note patterns kind of "vertical," or in only a couple of fretboard positions.  I think you can use similar strategies to get those two sections that we started to look at toward the end of your lesson.

Remember that you can use the melodic minor scale and the diminished arpeggio patterns to help you.  Here's a blurb about the melodic minor scale, if you're interested (theory nerd alert!!): https://www.auralwiz.com/d-melodic-minor-scale.html

Thanks, and have a great couple of weeks.

Devil's

Hi, Noe.

Nice job jamming on #28 today.  That bass line fits over these chords: C, F, G, C; or these chords: C, F, G, Am.  If you choose to play it with the Am scenario, your "fills" will have to revolve around the notes in the Am scale(s) and/or the Am chord (minor thirds, fifths).

I encourage you to practice putting fills in the bass line, and making the bass line more or less complex (fill A and/or fill B and/or octave licks).

Thanks, and have a great couple of weeks.

Today, we jammed on "Melodic Rhythms" #7 and #9.  Now that you can jam pretty smoothly with another person, I want you to think about a few elements of musicality and expression while you're listening to any music that's got bass in it.  Preferrably full-band with bass.  For example, listen for the following qualities:

- amount of notes in a phrase or riff

- "walking" bass lines

- bass lines that just follow the root notes (or are more similar to what the rhythm guitarist is playing)

- amount of space between notes (the pauses can make the notes have a bigger impact)

- see if you recognize any scales, or if it's major or minor

The book exercise we jammed on was the second half of #28.  Let's jam on that a little more next lesson, since that one was at the last minute.


metal - lots of same note
motown - lots of different notes
folk - more subtle, may be one note for an entire measure
hard rock and metal more in sync with guitar - outlining root notes
if lyrics staying out of way
bass is leaving space for other things



Thanks, and have a great week.

	•	Please practice "Melodic Rhythms" 7 and 8 this week.  You can start to add more challenges to those exercises, such as playing it in two different positions back and forth like we did today, using different pick-finger combinations (like i/a, or m/a), and of course exercising different tempos.
	•	remember to comment on Pete Licis song - listen to it because she'll ask what I liked about it

Hi, Noe.

Excellent work creating your solo bass arrangement of "Hallelujah."  I think that one was a great opportunity to exercise your knowledge, use your "ear-training," and to explore your workflow/practice process as you get creative.  Well done, and very musical-sounding.

Hallelujah - key of C Major

Write fretboards above staff

Blank ukelele chord chart or a page full of blank ukelele chord charts - for each hand shape, keep it on a separate piece of paper


Hi, Noe.

I think a great first step to turning "Hallelujah" into a solo bass piece is to try to fit the root notes of the chords in with the main (vocal) melody.  That will create a "melody + accompaniment" type of feel, but is not as difficult as adding improv, like the J. Hepburn material.

Here's the link I got the chords from: https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jeff-buckley/hallelujah-chords-198052

Thanks, and I look forward to hearing what you come up with.

PS  blank fretboard charts (like the ones guitar and ukelele players use to show them how to make their chord shapes) may help with this process.  I got some full pages of blank 4-string fretboard charts by googling "blank ukelele chord charts."


Hi, Noe.

Here's that link for the "Hallelujah" melody: https://www.songsterr.com/a/wsa/jeff-buckley-hallelujah-tab-s380120t1

And here's that Victor Wooten rendition of "Amazing Grace" - BTW, the album this is on is outstanding: https://open.spotify.com/track/4bp6H7tlYYxpsNV0fFiNPO?si=7f3e3f10e1a04981

I love what you've done with "The Fair City" so far.  I think for now, if you'd like to learn how to add all of those extra flourishes (harmonics, grace notes, hammer-on and pull-off licks, etc.) let's start with some simpler songs first.  "Hallelujah" is a great choice, and there are certainly others we can explore as well.  Learn that main melody for now, and let's get creative next lesson.

Thanks, and have a great week.

Hi, Noe.

Your solo pieces sound great - you look like you're much more confident with your fretboard positioning, and your tone is great.  I am looking forward to the open mic on Sunday.

I love that song "Fair City" by Jordan Hepburn.  Definitely something to strive for for the long-run.  Until then, we can analyze the song a bit and see what it's made of.  So far, it sounds to me like it may be in the key of E major, but he uses the E mixolydian mode for that main riff.  Let's keep that one in rotation.

Thanks, and I'll see you Sunday.

---------------

Great job with Bass Solo #1 today.  Your tone is great, and keep adding those stylistic elements like vibrato, variations in pick-hand tone, and fermatas.  Sounds like you are making good progress on #2 as well.  Remember to choose the most practical fret-hand positioning for some of those really intricate riffs.  Write down your fretboard positions if you need to.

Keep working with #5 from "Melodic Rhythms."  We're going to start taking one exercise at a time and adding one or two elements of style at a time.  Today, we explored staccato, and how to make that happen with fret hand, pick hand, or both simultaneously.

------------------

Hi, Noe.



Here are some tips for learning the pieces/getting them performance ready:

1) add those elements of expression such as vibrato, dynamics, tone, playing the same phrases in different places on the fretboard, fermatas, etc.

2) Both of these pieces have two melody lines - a lower one and a higher one.  Learn one at a time before putting them together.  Make adjustments to your positioning once you start putting the two together.

3) Write (in pencil or notation program) note/phrase positions, dynamic markings, note names - anything that will help you get through the piece.

Thanks, and Happy New Year
