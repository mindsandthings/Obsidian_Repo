# Bass practice plan, Fri, Apr 10, 2020
Attend to:
	Hand moving in 6 dimensions
	Hand tilting toward pinky when I go higher
	Rest strokes vs free strokes in picking hand
Scales at 70, 80, 90 bpm in 4 positions and both 4th and 3rd strings
	Major pentatonic
	Minor pentatonic
	Major
	Natural minor
Seven Nation Army (link in bookmarks):
	work on the "main" riff (the one in 7th position), and going back and forth between that and the "transitional" riff (the 3rd and 5th fret part)
	refine your position switching skills in the fretting hand, and your i and m alternate picking.

~To review~
* Remember to try Loopz app again later
* Fret hand fingers are numbered 1-4 from index to pinky
* Pick hand fingers are i(index) m(middle) a(ring finger) and p(thumb).  
* Fretboard position = a set of 4 frets.  Ex: 5th position is frets 5, 6, 7, 8.
* You can move your fretting hand in 6 dimensions to keep wrist straight

~Video setup~ 
* Get water and any needed snack
* Extend curtain
* Cane chair in position
* Get rolling chair out of way
* Scoot amp closer to me so it won't pull cord
* Turn amp on
* Set up iPad
* With camera, ensure iPad can see both my hands and my head no matter how I shift or don't
* Warm up with scales and bass line
