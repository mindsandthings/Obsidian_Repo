~To review~
Remember to try Loopz app again later
Fret hand fingers are numbered 1-4 from index to pinky
Pick hand fingers are i(index) m(middle) a(ring finger) and p(thumb).  
Fretboard position = a set of 4 frets.  Ex: 5th position is frets 5, 6, 7, 8.
You can move your fretting hand in 6 dimensions to keep wrist straight
