# Jae CW committee resignation draft

I was asked to serve on a diversity-related thing, with disability/neurodiversity and queerness mentioned to me by the person who asked, 
. Disability and neurodiversity were explicitly mentioned by the person who asked me. We just got the readings for the half-day session, 

We were sent five readings 

Hi Jae, I looked at the readings Rachelle sent out, and I'm not the right person to contribute to the committee - you need a disabled/neurodivergent BIPOC who can speak to accessibility issues from within those experiences. If I talk about accessibility, it won't reflect disabled BIPOC experiences, and since I would be speaking from a white disabled experience I'm likely to inadvertently suggest accessibility-related things that conflict with the committee's emphasis. 

I'll send a better-worded email at some point in the future, but: I looked at Rachelle's readings and realized I'd misunderstood the committee's focus. I'm not the right person for the committee - I can't adequately reflect nonwhite disabled people's experiences, and there's also a real risk that I'll talk about accessibility issues and people will mentally equate them to white people issues and use that to dismiss them, which is something I've seen happen in multiple social justice spaces. 

Those spaces also tend to be really unfriendly to nonwhite disabled people and that's unfortunately but their concerns

I genuinely have nothing to add here that doesn't risk being seen as a roadblock. I'm 


I'm also .
