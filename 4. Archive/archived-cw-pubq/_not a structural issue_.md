# "not a structural issue"

Spelling/grammar/punctuation can be access issues for some people, in different directions. When I read writing with frequent errors it has same the cognitive and emotional effects as being repeatedly interrupted while trying to concentrate, and (especially if I'm critiquing) it takes a lot more time and leaves me emotionally drained. I think generally the access issues are the other way around - someone doesn't have the time/energy/skills/ability to catch and correct errors, and they get discriminated against for it. (edited)

This is such a good point about how there are access barriers and burdens in multiple directions

I feel like this is an individual access barrier and not a systemic social one, if that makes sense?

Like, there are plenty of fics I have backed out of because of these sorts of errors but I just...don't engage with the fic. Whereas the author who makes these errors has a lot of assumptions made about them and their abilities.

Yes

I think there is also a tremendous increased ease of access that standardized spelling and standardized font gives us in reading, that we take for granted a lot?

I mean, I think the standardization definitely eases things for some - and maybe even most - people!

I'm not saying I'm structurally discriminated against for that


 [Ginger Weil](https://app.slack.com/team/U8P5P37LK)    [9 months ago](https://pubq.slack.com/archives/C197WGS1F/p1594315328392700?thread_ts=1594314916.381600&cid=C197WGS1F) 
Because reading spelled-how-it-sounds to the writer handwriting is just much slower for most people than reading mostly-standardized print in a legible font 


 [Noe Bartmess](https://app.slack.com/team/U3PEXQU9L)    [9 months ago](https://pubq.slack.com/archives/C197WGS1F/p1594315356393400?thread_ts=1594314916.381600&cid=C197WGS1F) 
But I also can't make it go away. I've resolved it the same way I've resolved a lot of other access issues which is to remove myself from participating in things

 [@noe](https://pubq.slack.com/team/U3PEXQU9L)  I didn't think you were! I'm just always like...we should explicitly say these things too. ![](%22not%20a%20structural%20issue%22/1f642@2x.png)

yeah my problems are freak problems


 [Ginger Weil](https://app.slack.com/team/U8P5P37LK)    [9 months ago](https://pubq.slack.com/archives/C197WGS1F/p1594315410395800?thread_ts=1594314916.381600&cid=C197WGS1F) 
I guess I was just thinking that if we dropped standardization entirely, it would create a bigger more widespread access issue for a lot of people, and requiring perfect standardization also creates an access issue

 [@noe](https://pubq.slack.com/team/U3PEXQU9L)  I don't think they are "freak" problems!


 [Noe Bartmess](https://app.slack.com/team/U3PEXQU9L)    [9 months ago](https://pubq.slack.com/archives/C197WGS1F/p1594315488396800?thread_ts=1594314916.381600&cid=C197WGS1F) 
I mean, wherever we put "acceptable" along that line, there will always be access issues for some or other people


 [Ginger Weil](https://app.slack.com/team/U8P5P37LK)    [9 months ago](https://pubq.slack.com/archives/C197WGS1F/p1594315504397500?thread_ts=1594314916.381600&cid=C197WGS1F) 
Agree. It’s really a competing needs space 


 [Noe Bartmess](https://app.slack.com/team/U3PEXQU9L)    [9 months ago](https://pubq.slack.com/archives/C197WGS1F/p1594315517397800?thread_ts=1594314916.381600&cid=C197WGS1F) 
We're just deciding where the cutoff points are, and who gets to be on which side of them


 [Marianne Kirby](https://app.slack.com/team/U4CH1NRJ4) ![](%22not%20a%20structural%20issue%22/slack-imgs.com.png)   [9 months ago](https://pubq.slack.com/archives/C197WGS1F/p1594315528398000?thread_ts=1594314916.381600&cid=C197WGS1F) 
 [@Ginger](https://pubq.slack.com/team/U8P5P37LK)  I don't think the solution is to do away with all standardization - but rather to acknowledge that it is not a marker of "correctness" so much as "standard in this situation." And then we gotta actually help people instead of just being assholes about it.

sorry, I punched my own buttons here and it was not wise of me.

Thank you for sharing a complicated thing, and apologies for taking it in maybe a draining direction

I think there are some structural issues at play, but they're complicated issues about what gets classified as an actual access need vs classified as the desires of a shitty person who hurts the people with the real access needs and inconveniences everyone else.
