# PubQ microaggressions survey

(Caveat #1: what I'm about to say is not about the issue that the BIPOC initiative is responding to, because in that situation, people did speak up. Caveat #2: I'm not a POC.) 

Especially over the last year or two and especially in tw-publishing, I've noticed a tendency for PubQ'ers to immediately align with each other based on whatever take is posted initially, and to not check whether the initial take gives an accurate picture of the situation. Sometimes relevant details weren't known to the initial poster, for example, and they may come out pretty late, after the people involved have already committed to a particular view. 

I think there's a rush to be supportive and validating that's what I would want out from a close friendship or relationship, or for that matter a small support group. When it's in a professional context that involves a large number of people, it can make it very hard to disagree or to post additional information that can be seen as being unsupportive of the original poster. It's also vulnerable to potential abuse by anyone who wants an easy way to get an entire community to align against a specific person for personal gain. To my knowledge it has not been abused that way, but if it has not already happen, I think it likely will at some point. 

More generally, I think there's such a strong culture of immediate agreement in PubQ that mild disagreement can feel less disagreeing with what someone said and more like it will be interpreted as an aggression against the community, with the community being defined as the people who are loudest and who already agree with each other. 

This is behind a lot of why I've mostly faded from PubQ over the last year: it feels like a space where it's increasingly less safe to not reflect the immediate mood of a channel, and like a space where mentioning something that complicates a discussion or even continuing a discussion not exactly in the right way may be interpreted as a violation of community values. Even though I usually do agree with the predominant mood of a channel, I don't want to be in spaces that prioritize uniformity so heavily. I think it also underlies the two disability-related microaggressions I remember most strongly, since those both involved me or someone else saying that what someone else said didn't work for us for disability-related reasons.

I think honestly one of the biggest things the admin team could do is purposefully nudge conversations toward respectful disagreement more often, especially early on in discussions when people are aligning.
