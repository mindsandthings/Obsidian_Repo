I guess it comes down to “I’m not a woman but I don’t want to simultaneously be seen as one and implicitly excluded”

**Today's optional journaling questions,** inspired by a story in Capricious's gender diverse pronouns special issue: 
**1)** What good gender-related advice would you give to younger you? (At any age/ages.) 
**2)** What less good gender-related advice would an earlier version of you have given to a still younger you, and how would you correct it?
**3)** Any guesses as to how future you might wind up answering the previous two questions? (You can pick how far in the future you want "future you" to be)

1a. To me at 22: a) No one has said this yet, but not having a gender is a thing. b) That's one of the reasons you're uncomfortable with pressure to adopt specific political views based solely on assigned gender, but you don't actually need more than one reason. c) You may be failing at expressing your assigned gender, but that doesn't mean you're failing as a person. d) Dye your hair and keep it short. No, really. You'll be so much happier. You do not have to pre-achieve a certain level of coolness for this. e) If you don't think of yourself as a woman you'll be so much happier. f) Keep on enjoying your partners enjoying your body, this is not in conflict with any of the previous. 1b. To me at 25: a) when the male scientists/programmers in your boyfriend's friend circle with its weird gender/occupation dichotomy decided to put you in the woman = audience category, there are multiple reasons this is upsetting. You don't need multiple reasons. You will be happier if you stop trying to be friends with them. b) Did I mention you'll be happier if you don't think of yourself as a woman? c) You're still not failing as a person. 1c. To me at 30-whatever-it-was: a) There's another reason that being pressured into adopting a particular gendered clothing style is upsetting to you, but you don't actually need a reason. Ignore the person telling you this is anti-feminist. b) But do try leggings and tunics, they're the most comfortable clothes you'll have ever worn. c) See above re: not thinking of yourself as a woman will make you much happier.2. You need to figure out how to do makeup and otherwise perform gender adequately because you're getting older. (No, you don't. You can look into it if you decide you want to, but you don't have to, and putting pressure on yourself to do that is stressing you out unnecessarily.)3. Look, just get an undercut or something and dye it blue. Stop worrying about being a stereotype; you don't have to please those people, either. Don't worry about whether you're "too old" to do that. Also, you don't like wearing skinny jeans; why do you still own them? You know you like baggy pants; get a couple pairs and some flannel shirts, put on Smells Like Teen Spirit, and party like it's 1993, because you don't have to conform to decade either. Oh, and get knee-length skirts and tunics instead of shorter ones. Or tea-length. You like those lengths. You still don't have to gender conform. There is no age cutoff for gender nonconformity.
