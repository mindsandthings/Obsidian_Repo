# CW clarion west slack channel deletions

[4/8/21: an update is sent out with a link to a post on the website. post has no mention of disability: 
"by providing a safe space for participants to explore race, class, gender, and sexual orientation within and beyond the genre of speculative fiction". 
Also, they list my name despite me backing out months ago.] 

[also: the link for the 2-9-2021 meeting wasn't sent out to the "volunteers", in presumably a way to uninvited people who weren't paid BIPOC. I found this out from Huw an older email that I was cc'd on to ask if the link had been sent out and he'd missed it. Read Jae's follow-up]


still up:
id-qtpoc, 7 members, only posted in once, on Jun 25. Last members joined July 4. 
id-non_us_based_writers, 32 members (did not check posts as I felt it was much more likely to be active)
id-cw_alum, 32 members (I assume this was left up for obvious reasons)

archived on Jan 12: 
id-autistic, created by rashida on June 9. I count eleven members. It had a number of posts, last message on Jun 29. 
id-lgbtqia, I count 12 members, last post on Jan 1. 
id-non_binary, I count 13 members, last post Jun 24

Were other ID channels archived? No. Many nonID channels seem to have been archived though. So maybe it was part of a general cleanout? I'm still uncomfortable that the qtpoc channel, which has fewer people than the archived ID channels, was not archived.
