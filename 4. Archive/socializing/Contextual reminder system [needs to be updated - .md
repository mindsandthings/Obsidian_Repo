\# Contextual reminder system \[needs to be updated - 9/21/21\]

\* hey kids, remember that endever is more tuned in to the (online at least) Deaf community than you are

\* Deaf students: wait for them to invite you. Remember the connection may not be between you and them; it may be between them and another Deaf person, or a neurotypical hearing person.

\* Don't assume one invitation means a future invitation; don't assume two invitations mean a third invitation.

\* If someone declines to show up once, wait for them to contact you to meet again.

\* Do. Not. Tease. People. If you tease a hearing person, you're making fun of their signing; if you tease a Deaf person, you're making fun of their lack of access to English. Don't tease them unless they tease you first, even if you want to establish an environment of camaraderie.

\* If you get asked to something in a group you already prepared for, type up what notes other people mention and then share one or two that weren't shared. Don't list off all of them.

\* remember to be super careful with deaf stuff - don't talk about the videos thing. research support and other supporting roles are good

\* It's important to remember that you don't have to stand up for things you care about, and when you're in a situation where you feel like you do, you've probably misread the situation.

\* Pain: if you find yourself lying down reading for too long the problem may be lower back pain. Get up and put on Voltaren gel.

\* If you are feeling a little achy or super out of it, do jaw/head and neck/TOS trps.

\*\*Your goals are to keep vulnerable insiders safe, especially people afraid of being harmed if we don't stand out / fawn / welcome others / build bridges.\*\*

Remember: downplayed, low-key, understated, reliable. Low-maintenance, a grownup who can be ignored if possible.

DON'T FAWN WITH TEACHERS OR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. BE DISTANT. IT'S OKAY. YOU AREN'T MISSING AN OPPORTUNITY.

You are doing a good job not speaking up too much in class. You shouldn't have gone first in that one group because there was a black woman there, but otherwise you're doing good.

Part of what's going on is you feel a responsibility to make sure everyone gets a chance to speak up, and feel that you as an older person have some responsibility - but your responsibility won't be seen as creating inclusion and structure, it will be seen as fading into the background so that others can take prominence. So it's important that you remember that. It's okay to let things be awkward - you don't have to do the thing Mom convinced you that you did and help make others feel welcome.

\*\*The way to be inclusive is to stand back. The way to be inclusive is to let others go first.\*\*

\*\*The way to be inclusive is to contribute less than you think you can. The way to be inclusive is to downplay your knowledge and intelligence. If you are batting above your level, you need to bat less. Throw the game. You do have more responsibilities, but those responsibilities are to make space—not to take a social lead role.\*\*

\*\*Remember: it isn't about fairness. It isn't even about effectiveness. It's about safety and not hurting other people.\*\*

\*\*Don't try to engage with other people on demographic similarities, especially if you don't have the exact same identity they do. You have a high risk of coming off as a majority culture member being intrusive/aggressive/overly friendly, or coming off as an unwanted socially lower person who they will need to distance themselves from.\*\*

\*\*Do not cross group lines in the name of inclusiveness, and do not imply that you share interests with someone else. Do not imply that different groups share something in common, and do not act as though disabled people (and especially autistic people) belong in some kind of marginalized people coalition, except for the subsets who belong to other more highly prioritized groups.\*\*

It will hurt, but you need to keep remembering that exclusion is the goal. It is not a result of mistakes or ideological inconsistency, it is literally the unspoken intent.

Do not get caught up in reality-testing or defending yourself. \*Having hope is the problem. Thinking that you are in a "safe" setting where identity politics don't apply is also a problem. You are never outside of them. There is no "normal life" anymore; that was a product of the times, not the places.\*

Do you feel:

\* Indignant/hurt/triggered?

\* Comfortable in a space?

\* A desire to contribute?

\* Excited about a potential new opportunity to contribute?

\* Kind, helpful, or proud of yourself?

\* Like you have special knowledge, skills, or experiences to contribute?

\* Are you meeting new people or in new social contexts or groups?

\* Are you interacting with authority?

\* \*\*Do you feel a responsibility due to being older?\*\*

\* \*\*Do you want to make other people welcome?\*\*

\* Afraid that you'll miss your chance to be recognized?

~Showing off~

\* DO NOT VOLUNTEER TO HELP IN CLASS. WAIT FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

\* REMEMBER THERE ARE A LOT OF POC IN CLASS. DO NOT PRESUME ON THEM JUST BECAUSE YOU FEEL SAFE.

~Wanting to help individual people~

\* \*\*Your goals are to avoid making people feel bad by overdoing things for them, and to avoid making them feel like they are not contributing enough or that they owe you.\*\*

\* If someone is performing a job and having difficulty or being tired, do not try to take it away from them just because you want to do it (for example, holding the baby). They will experience it as criticism. Instead, make it about you, but carefully - they are alert to the fact that you may do this.

~Meeting new people / new social contexts / new groups~

\* \*\*Your goals are to avoid standing out, and to demonstrate that you can make people who already feel like they belong there feel good.\*\*

\* DON'T OVERDO IT

\* In addition to questions, think about 1-2 things about myself I can share for each question. If they pick up on the questions, they want to have a chat; if they don't, then ok to continue.

\* When you join a community, start by responding to others' posts. Wait for someone to post if necessary. Do not post right away.

~Indignance / hurt / triggered feeling~

\* \*\*Your goals are to avoid evoking further stress for yourself and to make sure you don't keep contributing to a situation that hurts you.\*\*

\* You are not compelled to speak up; you do not have responsibilities to other people, especially those not present.

\* People whose advice persistently mistakes your goals aren't your friends, even if they're nice to you. People aren't your friends just because they're nice to you. Their actions are important, not their mannerisms, and you don't have to dislike them in order to leave.

\* When you notice a narcissist or someone that persistently annoys you in a space, disengage emotionally from the group in preparation for leaving.

\* Don't complain to someone about other people who are doing the same task for you, and especially don't do this with e*.

~Comfort in spaces feeling~

\* \*\*Your goals are to avoid acting too comfortable, so that you will not overdo it and hurt other people and so that they are less likely to target you.\*\*

\* Watch for others' fawn reactions and back down, even if it seems inappropriate and manipulative on their part. If you push the issue, you'll feel guilty later.

\* \*\*You are a middle-aged white woman. Contributing risks being seen as aggressive towards PoC. Be very careful about what you contribute, and let others go first.\*\*

\* You need to not exceed other people's indifference and reservation. When they're outgoing and gregarious, you still need to be indifferent and reserved! They act like that because they're displaying dominance and belonging. It is not an indication of what the space will be like for you - it's to visibly show to other people that it's their space.

\* In groups, your goal is to be one of the faceless masses. Your fawn response actively endangers you. Your cooperation response actively endangers you. Your instinct to connect actively endangers you. Do not try to stand out. Do not try to be distinctly yourself. You are \*supposed\* to imitate an invisible middle-aged neurotypical woman. That is the \*goal\*; it is not an accident.

~Wanting to contribute / kindness / helpfulness / pride feeling~

\* \*\*Your goal is to avoid overworking, to avoid hurting other people and making them back away, and to avoid being targeted.\*\*

\* Remember, people don't want to hear something relevant to them, or have something shared with them. They want to feel like the things they say and post are appreciated. When you share, you get little or no response and feel bad. So respond to others and appreciate their contributions.

\* Your role as a middle-aged white woman is to provide people with your attention, but not in a way that makes them feel they have to notice you, because that is demanding on their attention.

\* Do not show off. Beware of your fawn response; it will not lead to connection, just overwork strain and making other people not feel good enough.

\* DO NOT SUGGEST THINGS. People are no longer appreciative or interested. They are overwhelmed with information and need you to reduce it, not increase it.

\* Other people need to have a perception that they are in CONTROL. Ask yourself: will this make someone feel like the situation isn't standard, predictable, unremarkable? If so, they'll feel off-balance and like they're losing control. You don't want to do that to people.

\* You are \*not supposed to be the best\*. You are \*not supposed to be visibly good\*. You are supposed to be stable, independent, and happy—and to not make other people uncomfortable by appearing otherwise.

\* You don't want to make other people feel bad about themselves or uncomfortable. That hurts them.

\* Each time you start a new venture: lay out conditions under which it is acceptable to contribute. Then, stick to those. If they work badly, adjust later, but don't adjust on the fly.

\* Don't try to be helpful. KNOW YOUR PLACE.

~All interactions with authority~

\* \*\*Your goal is to avoid engaging in a fawn response, to avoid flipping other people into a fawn response, and to avoid time sucks. Your extra goal is to absolutely avoid being noticeable.\*\*

\* Affirm teachers. Don't challenge them, ever.

\* Don't show off. Don't surprise or confuse them.

\* People who want you to do things on hardcopy are obsessed with it. It's a religious point for them. Don't let on that you're going digital, don't suggest or imply it, don't try to help anyone.

\* Don't introduce people to tools in their field of study. Don't act as though you know more than they do. Don't bring up topics as if they don't know about them—even if they don't! Don't assume you have some connection. Don't act as though you have discovered something they don't know about or haven't already dismissed. (Don't treat them like an expert either—you will make them feel very awkward by assuming they can act as one, because you are probably mistaken about where their expertise lies and how they can relate to the public. They are not experts in order to relate to the public; they are experts in order to be a normal part of their own discipline.)

\* If you feel like you might be showing off, stop. Stop, stop, stop. If you feel proud of yourself or what you're doing, stop. Back down. Delete it and dump it. If deleting your work isn't an option because it's a mandatory obligation to someone else, put in the extra work to make it look less impressive, no matter what.

\* DO NOT THINK "maybe she'll be my friend".

~Excitement over new opportunities feeling~

\* \*\*Your goal is to avoid overcommitment that damages your mental health and your ability to meet other goals, and to avoid exposure that will make you a target.\*\*

\* Beware of your reward responsiveness. That feeling of excitement means you will wind up committing yourself to a huge stressor and feel trapped and exploited. Use it as a cue to say no.

\* Don't sign up for diversity or disability things or anything approaching social justice ever again. Be wary if invited, and politely turn it down. Recommend they get a disabled bipoc, then \*do not say anything else\* - further comment center-stages you and risks your being seen as passive-aggressive.

\* Refrain from making suggestions or having opinions about how groups operate, especially groups with marginalized people, including groups you are a member of—because other people have more intersections in those groups and are more marginalized. Do not volunteer, do not contribute more than the minimum, do not step in, do not be visible. If someone in power invites you to contribute, distrust them no matter who they are—they think people will respond positively to you, and they are wrong.

~Specific topics to be careful with~

\* \*\*Your goal is to avoid getting stuck and off track, and to avoid unnecessarily triggering yourself.\*\*

\* Remember: you do not owe anyone anything.

\* Homeschooling - choose your battles

\* Writing on Tumblr - do not do it. You wind up in a time sink.

\* Autism - do not share your personal distress stuff. It suggests that you are competing for status as a marginalized person and trying to use trauma to get out of punishment. It also exposes others to trauma.

\* Tech support - remember that seeking tech support triggers communication trauma.

\* Privacy - remember that you want privacy, even if it seems like sharing your experience will help others. Retaining privacy also helps you avoid intruding into social spaces.

~Recognizing yourself in other people / connecting over shared interests / emotional crush feeling~

\* \*\*You want to avoid making yourself feel like a leper, avoid making people uncomfortable, and avoid cementing the perception of autistic people as overly friendly.\*\*

\* People will retreat if they notice you're interested in them! Don't do it!

\* Don't bring up games with game developers. It is a part of your identity, but they will not see a connection.

\* Don't bring up tech stuff/programming with programmers/tech people. In the past they've had a noticeable lack of interest and may look down on you. You don't like feeling that way. It's better to let discussions of tech be someone else's domain, even (especially) when interest and skill with tech is the basis for social worth in that environment.

\* Don't try to bring up ongoing issues or ask someone to communicate openly or directly with you. Most people will perceive it as an act of aggression.

\* Stop writing too much! Stop spending so much time on things! Your overcommitment shows, and when you hit the end of the day or the project you wind up in self-hatred.

\* Do not write long emails. Figure out how to write short emails. Drop some points. It's okay to serve other people badly.

~Specific friends~

\* e*: don't expose them to negative emotions or mention interpersonal conflict. It makes them super uncomfortable. They will back away.

~Specific groups and people to avoid approaching~

\* Please remember that although you like Ada and she's reasonable, she also overreacts to her own scrupulosity issues, and also is friends with Bogi and RB and other people who are less reasonable.

\* Gabriel unfriended you (or never friended you) and ignores your texts. He's polite in person, but if you respond to that you will feel ashamed and regretful later.

\* Brent Lambert was in your writing group; do not fawn for safety or give in to being friendly. He is hostile and you are hostile. You asked him to proofread his stuff; he kept criticizing your autistic character/writing style; you sent an overly long writeup about autism to the group and he bailed, then you sent a weird email to the group and came off as passive-aggressive, whereas he successfully cloaked his passive-aggressiveness behind politeness. Be neutral with him, and reserved.

\* Miri Baker (PubQ) uses "your best isn't good enough, do better" language.

\* Marianne (PubQ) is a bully whom you have seen bully people before; you are not obligated to take her in good faith. If she confronts you, say: "I'm not sure that sits completely right with me. I'll think about it and get back to you."

\* PQ generally: They weaponize a social justice framework against people in order to appear more victimized. There are good people in there, but the framework forces things into being profoundly unsafe for you, and you cannot afford to participate.

\* Suzan Palumbo: stay the fuck away. She bullied Kelly (who admittedly should have backed down immediately), flipped Jill into a fawn response, plays the victim, and was one of two people behind the new rules. Beware Dave Ring also.

\* Ruti doesn't want to talk to you, and even if she did, she doesn't respect your time and energy. She probably doesn't want you reading her writing or thinking about her either.

\* Sara Luterman is irresponsible and ghosts on her commitments, including two major professional commitments to you. You actually resent her. Don't be nice to her.

\* John Marble monopolizes a room. Do not flatter or hang out around him even though he is important and has charisma and you want to be part of it.

\* Elsa is a bitch and socially dominant and noticeably refrained from replying to your helpful post about hearing aids. She backed out of your critique group. She doesn't like you and doesn't like something you've done. She has contempt for you and a lot of other people and you've seen her be supportive to someone else exactly once in five years. She has admitted to putting on a persona on Twitter. She's a cold, unfriendly person with zero chance of reciprocating anything you do.

\* C.L. Polk also didn't respond to your helpful post about hearing aids. They probably look down on you and see you as a poser.

\* Rivers Solomon did not want to talk to you in private. Probably because you fucked up your trigger warning, and also because you are white and privileged and don't share their pain. They have nothing to do with you.
