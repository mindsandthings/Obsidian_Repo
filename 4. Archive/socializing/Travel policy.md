# Travel policy

Skipping this Christmas 2021 due to covid.

When rates drop to ??? I will schedule a visit, for Summer maybe? 

And see if I can hit Florida, Knoxville, and Cincy all in one trip, to reduce emissions. (Is that where Beth and Katie will be?) 

I will also pay for carbon fees although I know they may not make a difference. 

After that I will try to do 1 trip every 2 years.
