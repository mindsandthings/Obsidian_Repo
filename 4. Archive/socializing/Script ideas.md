To portray experiences I've had, many of which are underrepresented or badly represented in fiction. They include, among other things, growing up autistic and otherwise disabled but undiagnosed, having difficulty fulfilling expected gender roles, and being raised outside the mainstream in life-altering ways. 
 
I write speculative fiction about complex people with unusual developmental backgrounds, set in possible futures and alternate presents. I think carefully about how each speculative element would affect the world and its people. What culture and accommodations would a small colony of autistic people develop for each other? If isolation from mainstream culture gave children economically valued magical abilities that dissipated by adulthood, what would their adult lives look like? If we created a planned culture based on 1950s television shows, how could it alter itself to meet the needs of people who can't succeed at prescribed gender roles, or who exist but weren't portrayed onscreen?
