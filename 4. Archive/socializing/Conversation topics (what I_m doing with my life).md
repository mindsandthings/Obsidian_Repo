* Michael went out of town on Tuesday, for 3 weeks. 
* Had optometrist appt Wed, got vertical heterophoria diagnosis ("large difference" between the two eyes) and also she said my eyes want to cross and the only reason they don't is that Im constantly pulling them back out
* The lenses she tried on in office were amazing. Takes 2 weeks to get them but they will mail them to me. So probably like 2.5 weeks. So around Jul 5 just before Michael gets back. ): 
* I got a headache Thursday (neck ache, left side) and have had it for 3 days now. Getting very tired of it. Got it to go back in mostly or all this morning but it went out again.
* Next week: dental appt. Hoping I can avoid a headache. Was just this bad this week due to all the walking and BART I did. Dental is just 1-2 short bus rides though. (Possibly just 1 if taking scooter is realistic)
* Maya so cute
* Have been cleaning up den with Michael out

* Finished second chapter of new novel! Fast. Surprisingly easy to write. Have been working on incorporating techniques from a class I took, like rhetorical devices and reading aloud to edit for cadence. 
* Maya asked me (in actions) to put my bathrobe on prior to feeding her
* Michael is leaving to go visit family and go on a road trip with his sister on Tuesday. 
* Today we went to Ana's new place. It's beautiful, and nicely decorated - she has a good sense for color coordination. Bronze, orange, mustard yellow. I put together a set of shelves for the porch and assembled her new couch. I also gave her the green plant with reddish leaves as a housewarming present since she'd expressed a desire to make cuttings of it on more than one occasion.

* Started first chapter of new novel. Got through all but 1-2 scenes. These are turning out to be 500-700 word scenes as opposed to 1800 like my last novel. 
* It's surprisingly easier to write, words flow much better. I think it really was the last novel and not my ability to generate words
* 
*

* Ana moved. I am stressed over interfacing with her - she wanted furniture etc plates and I have found them for her but. very stressful
* and Mozelle got sick and Allie got sick and I babysat on Saturday. I feel like time is slipping through my fingers and also I am too hot in this room and upstairs
* I don't even know what the fuck is happening, I can't remember anything beyond what' happening right now
* 

~Sat, May 22, 2021~
* Anna visiting. Maya doesn't like her, probably because Anna tries to keep Maya constantly occupied (or, if Anna's tired, doesn't give her access to stuff to entertain herself) instead of giving her the option of entertaining herself and letting Maya decide when to interact. I have taken Maya sometimes because I feel so bad for her, even though my doing that makes Anna feel bad. 
* I handed over my iPad to Michael a couple days ago and have been back in commission except for today when I've had a weird new headache I'm hoping isn't due to starting terbinafine.
* Been missing Discord and CABS server a lot these last couple days. It's been a little over six months. I haven't gone back because I think it'll work poorly and there will probably be seriously upsetting content, but I can't help but hope that system eventually got kicked out and people miss me. Except I know they don't, because C&B posted to Twitter trying to get them a job. I actually expect to go back and get a msg in my admin channel from Tiff taking me to task over an infraction. 
* Immunity day was Tuesday. I celebrated by getting bloodwork and my bass setup. Bass sounds nicer. Bloodwork was all fine. 
* Still not doing in-system communication.
* Outlined a novel. Realized it had problematic components. Trying to fix them. Headache. Feel I've given up / given in / am making a mistake by not switching genres, but if I switch genres then I have to be realistic. 
* Grieving over ceding diversity to initiatives with exclusively bipoc focus. It hurts a lot. Also grieving over the toxic social justice version showing up in daily life now, and in jobs. 
*

* Maya still teething
* I played a lot of games
* Talked with Michael about it. He had suggestions. I experienced it as kind of a good moment. 
* Yesterday I rearranged the den to have a place to lie and play games, and a place to do stretches. 
* Anna is visiting. 

~Sun, May 9, 2021~
* Babsat Maya Friday and part of Sat. Maya is getting her top teeth and probably in pain. Wants to be distracted all the time. I walked her around a lot. 
* Still breaking from writing
* Mostly played Slay the Spire but did manage some other stuff. Thurs-Fri-Sat was especially bad due to premenstrual symptoms
* Got second covid vaccine
* Today was Mother's Day; I suggested Julie and I call Anne and mom in a videochat. 
* Margie Deep Editing class started. It seems to help. 


~Sat, May 1, 2021~
* Still breaking from writing
* Slay the Spire strategy collapsed after I tried to do self-work instead of just ongoing to-do items racking up
* I learned that Eric and Allie thought Maya didn't understand the sign "milk" because she never made it around milk. I pointed out to them that it might because she's asking for it, and encouraged them to treat it as communication. 
* Maya signed "all done" when she was eating and wanted an airplane ride; Allie said "she doesn't know what it means"; I insisted it was communication and Eric backed me up. 

~Sat, Apr 24, 2021~

* Maya giggles and kicks when I run up and down the runner carpet with her
* This week PubQ put new guidelines into place. They are likely to result in my having meltdowns due to the requirement to take time to reflect and then return to the conversation if someone expresses concern about race. [I need to double-check this - is this only for white members?] Other autistic AFAB folks were also having a lot of difficulty coping with this. I chatted with several people privately about it, and after some thought posted a public thing in the autistic channel (text saved somewhere), not about my primary concerns but about things that hadn't been said yet. Ada came in afterward and said that it was worse for POC so maybe we deserved to feel anxious. The new rules are going to be very easy for bullies to exploit, but it's essentially already been set up that we can't express concern. They took some of my suggestions about encouraging people to not use tw-businessy_publishing for support, but I didn't express any of my real concerns in it. 
* Consequently I had some meltdowns and (I hate this but I think it's the right choice) am only checking PubQ once a day and plan to fade entirely, or at least rarely check it. I'll definitely stop posting in channels. 
* Anyway, I played games excessively and crashed a bunch. fun.
