# Socialization plans
I haven't got a clue. Need to think about this and figure out how often and when.

* Have been hanging out with Eric Allie Maya at ~5:30 when Ana goes off work and that seems to be really good
* Have been helping with Maya in the morning sometimes (when Ana is not here yet) and after dinner for a bit in the evenings
* endever on Saturdays
* still not friends or local people. Went to autistic women's group Sat a week ago, but it was triggering and I can't do it again
* ASL on Fridays
* maybe after I start class in the fall I will make some friends? definitely should reevaluate after glasses. 
* really wish I'd gotten glasses a week earlier so I could have that week without Michael

I made plans for coffee with Lawrence and Erin but idk. I feel very guilty and like I am pressing them into things.

* I think I'm going to hold off on most things till I know what's up with the glasses. 
* I did contact Erin re rescheduling
