My childhood experience was similar, though less severe and less explicit. As an adult, I joined and then eventually left neurodiversity and disability circles partly because I burned out on people who saw their imagined version of my childhood as the ideal. 

"There's nothing wrong with my child and everything wrong with Society" is not a great parenting philosophy. When a child tells their parents that something is wrong with their body or their brain and they need help, and their parents respond by saying they're wonderful just as they are, that's rarely a sufficient response *even in instances where that's actually true*. 

Say the kid was doing harmless stimming and someone convinced them it was weird and therefore bad. Treating it solely like a self-esteem issue still misses the point, which is that the kid is going to run into other people like that in the future, and maybe this same person again, and the kid needs tools for figuring out when people are likely to be shitty to them and *deciding what to do about it* based on a realistic understanding of 1) their actual options and 2) the likely consequences of each option. The kid does need to know that there's nothing wrong with them and the other person was being a jerkâ€”but they also need help learning to navigate situations like that, and possibly learning to navigate this specific situation, and (depending on the situation) they might actually need a parent to intervene.

It's not good parenting to refuse to believe that something is wrong with your child when your child is telling you something has gone wrong with their body or brain and asking you for help. 

It is not good parenting to decide that your child doesn't need support learning to navigate society because society is the problem. 

Abuse and neglect are still abuse and neglect when they're dressed up as acceptance, and it is very, very easy to dress them up as acceptance.
