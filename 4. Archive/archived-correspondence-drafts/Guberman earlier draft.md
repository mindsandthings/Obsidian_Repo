# Guberman earlier draft

The former wasn't true in social psych, at least not in the late 90s or early 2000s—we had women doing research on gender, LGBTQ people doing research on sexual orientation, POC doing research on racial stereotyping, etc. It's possible it's different in biomedical sciences, although I suspect positions like "women should not be allowed to do research on pregnancy" aren't commonly held there either—so maybe it's specific to autism? Either way, I'm not sure most biomedical autism researchers believe that if a colleague discovers themself to be autistic they should quit the field; 

If I understand right, interpretivism means that you think that research results are partly 

; I suspect the thought process would be more like "huh, so my colleague's autistic, but a different kind of autistic than the kids we study, obviously"

Similarly, I suspect their dismissal of autistic twitter advocates has less to do with the fact that they think we're autistic than the fact that they think our autisticness isn't representative of what they study.

What I sent: 
You mentioned that the questions you can ask from a medical-model perspective don't count as valid science from a pro-neurodiversity perspective, and vice versa. I've mostly seen autistic community members, autistic researchers, and pro-neurodiversity non-autistic researchers advocating for very normal approaches - prioritizing research into things like co-conditions (sensory sensitivities, CPTSD, etc) and for looking at longitudinal and lifespan effects, including potential harms of therapies. 

Those can all be investigated in pretty standard ways. It's difficult for me to imagine most mainstream autism researchers hearing "we should do longitudinal follow-ups and include a trauma scale" and going "that's not real science!", or hearing someone ask "do sensory sensitivities worsen across the lifespan?" and going "that question doesn't make any sense!" 

My sense is that the biggest disagreements are about whether autistic non-scientists can provide useful insights on research, and about the extent to which autistic advocates on Twitter can meaningfully represent the larger autistic population. Those are both empirical questions, and I think if you asked non-autistic scientists and autistic twitter users if it was possible to design studies to answer those questions, almost all of them would agree that it's possible. I suspect it would even be possible for most people in both groups to agree on a study design to test it. 

So I see a lot of disagreement on priorities, and some disagreement on testable things, but I don't see people operating from mutually incomprehensible scientific paradigms. I do see people using words to mean different things, mostly involving non-scientists using technical terms incorrectly, or mistaking the popular meaning of a word for the scientific meaning of a word, or borrowing terms from science and adapting them to a broader or looser non-science context. 

Side note related to that: are your pro-neurodiversity participants using the term "research with sound methodologies" to refer to what they describe? The things listed are research priorities, researcher neurotypes, and beneficiaries of the research, but those are not research methodologies. 

I also chatted briefly with my spouse about this study - he's an autistic UX researcher with a social psych PhD - and his take is that the difference in approaches maps onto the difference between internal validity (whether a study is well-constructed) and external validity (how applicable the findings are to the outside world). These are both parts of science, but researchers seem more likely to come at research from an internal-validity perspective ("is this study well-constructed?") and autistic advocates more from an external-validity perspective ("what are the effects of this research on the real world?"). The two perspectives can seem opposed in some cases, but they're actually complementary. 

Earlier draft:
### One of your major conclusions is that the questions you can ask from a medical-model perspective don't count as valid science from a pro-neurodiversity perspective, and vice versa. What I've mostly seen is autistic community members and autistic researchers arguing that autism research needs to more strongly prioritize research into things like co-conditions (trauma, EDS, sensory sensitivities, etc) and to look at longitudinal effects of autism interventions, including those that may involve potential harms. 

### Those aren't what many mainstream researchers focus on, but it's difficult for me to believe that they would consider "we should do more research into sensory sensitivities" or "we should do a follow-up study on adults who underwent ABA as children" to be invalid science. Similarly, I wouldn't consider a study that asked the question "does ABA reduce symptoms of autism" to not really be science—I just think it could and should be done ethically and more effectively, by not giving ABA to people who haven't already had it and by broadening the outcome measures to look at non-visible symptoms and to check for potential harm. 

### So most of what I've seen is autistic community members, autistic scientists, and pro-neurodiversity non-autistic scientists making arguments about research priorities, research effects, and about how to do science more ethically and more effectively. 

### **tl;dr "The questions you can ask in one paradigm don’t make sense to or count as valid science in the other" is an extremely strong claim and doesn't reflect what I've seen.**

### -----


### Are your pro-neurodiversity participants using the term "research with sound methodologies" to refer to what they describe? I ask because the things listed are research priorities, researcher neurotypes, and beneficiaries of the research, but those are not the same thing as methodologies. 

### In science, choosing sound research methodologies means choosing the methods that will best let you test your hypothesis and answer your research question. Research methods are different from research priorities ("whether the research should be happening in the first place"), different from the researchers' neurotypes ("who was doing the research [there were strong arguments/demands for autistic-led research])", and different from who benefits from the research ("whether autistic people were the beneficiaries of the research"). 

### Conflating sound resaerch methodologies with research priorities, researcher neurotype, and research beneficiaries leads to a number of very bad things happening (I can expand on that if you want). 

### **tl;dr: If your pro-neurodiversity participants are using the term "research methodologies" to refer to those things, they're not just using the term in a different way, they're using it wrong. If this is true of other instances of using words differently as well, this finding may mostly reflect the fact that people who haven't been trained in a technical field often don't know the meaning of technical terms.**

### ---

### My sense is that the primary disagreement is over 1) whether autistic non-scientists can provide useful insights on design, implementation, and interpretation of research and 2) whether autistic advocates on Twitter can meaningfully represent the larger autistic population, both of which are empirical questions. If you asked non-autistic scientists and autistic twitter users if it was possible to design studies to answer those questions, I think almost all of them would agree that it's possible. I think you could even design those studies so that they'd agree they're a fair test. I don't think that involves fundamentally incompatible perspectives, just differing assumptions that could be tested and shown to be true or false.

### I also chatted briefly with my spouse about this study - he's an autistic UX researcher with a social psych PhD - and his take on disagreement relates to the difference between internal validity (whether a study is well-constructed) and external validity (how applicable the findings are to the outside world). These are both parts of science, but researchers seem more likely to come at research from an internal-validity perspective ("is this study well-constructed?") and autistic advocates more from an external-validity perspective ("what are the effects of this research on the real world?"). The two perspectives can seem opposed in some cases, but they're actually complementary.

### I'm going to list my key findings below some of which might be very obvious to you as someone who participates in autistic Twitter, but which might be novel to non-autistic academics). Please free to share your thoughts about them at your convenience. Let me know if you have any questions or if I can provide clarification about any of the points. Thanks again!

### Here are the findings:

### 1. Twitter a rich source of autistic counternarratives to potentially harmful, dominant academic autism discourses

### 2. These Autistic counternarratives adhere to a neurodiversity framework for understanding autism, while dominant autism discourses align with the medical-model of disability

### 3. These two different approaches to autism are fundamentally incompatible with one another. The same words can have radically different meanings and implications. The questions you can ask in one paradigm don’t make sense to or count as valid science in the other. This was particularly evident to me when I compared the research priorities of pro-neurodiversity Twitter users and researchers with the priorities of medical-model researchers. There were a few key examples that stop out where both groups seemed to share similar high-level research priorities, but the meaning and operationalization of these priorities was drastically different. For example, both groups are very interested in autism interventions. For medical-model folks, when they say they’re interested in interventions, they mean they want to make behavioral interventions for autistic children more widely available. 

### For neurodiversity folks, the focus on interventions entails (a) undermining the validity of the interventions by challenging their ethical and practical underpinnings and (b) demanding research into whether these interventions cause lasting trauma to the people subjects to them. 

### A second example was the shared high-level priority of having research with sound methodologies. Again, this meant fundamentally different things to each group. Medical model folks were interested in making sure they were using the right scales and measuring tools while performing the kinds of biomedical research common within the medical-model. For Neurodiversity-aligned folks, this meant assessing whether the research should be happening in the first place, who was doing the research (there were strong arguments/demands for autistic-led research), and whether autistic people were the beneficiaries of the research. 

### 4. I find that autistic interactions with non-autistic researchers on Twitter vary greatly depending on whether the researcher aligns with the medical model or the neurodiversity paradigm. In the cases I observed, these interactions were amicable. The non-autistic researchers responded to comments, questions, and even critiques of their research from autistic Twitter users as if the autistics were colleagues with important insights. Autistics sometimes approached these researchers with skepticism, but not with any outright hostility.

### On the other hand, autistics don’t seem to hold back when talking with or about medical-model researchers. It seems like there’s little motivation to be patient with researchers who subscribe to views and use methods that are seen as harmful (e.g., that autism needs to be corrected or prevented). And, while Neurodiversity-aligned non-autistic researchers seemed open to critique, the medical-model researchers are not. When they respond to autistics (which seems to be very rare), they’re likely to dismiss the critiques out of hand, often indicating that the people making the critiques are too unqualified to understand their research enough to make valid critiques.
