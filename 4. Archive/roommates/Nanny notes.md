# Nanny notes

Eric was saying last night you were planning to look for a part-time nanny from 11-3. I would potentially be interested, and if you are too I'd propose a two-week trial (not now but in November) with an optional extension if either of us decide not to continue and . 

2-week trial period; if either of us decides not to continue I could add an optional up to 2 weeks for you to have time to find and hire someone

Disadvantages: 
 - no childcare experience newer than 1994 other than what you've seen
 - mixing employment with friends and roommates can get complicated
 - I would not want to go fulltime
 - if she throws up on me I might need to get your help cleaning up 
 - someone else would need to walk Karl in the mornings 
 - less time for chores during the week (dishes and kitchen cleaning mainly)
 - I don't want to do it unless you'd be comfortable saying this isn't working out, we need to hire someone else

Advantages:
 - no extra covid exposure risk
 - you know me
 - In case you need someone to cover emergency childcare I live in convenient proximity
 - if we had to evacuate due to fires we'd probably be evacuating together and that would mean portable childcare

2 options: 
1. Just childcare. If she winds up napping I can sit and read or sit and write. 
2. A lot of Bay Area Craigslist postings combine nannying with housework or house management work (cleaning, laundry, bringing meals, planning things). I'd be willing to do that for a bump in pay. That would involve stuff for you personally - you wouldn't be paying me to do stuff I'd already be doing, unless those are things I've been doing more of that you would otherwise take back up. (except for phone calls, I would not do those)

Craigslist ads for SF Bay area are $25-35 for experienced, $20 is low-end or live-in. $18 for childcare-only, $22 for childcare + housework or house management work.

Contract stuff:
 - if I'm doign something wrong tell me very directly. 
 - if I keep doing it, it's because I misinterpreted or forgot, so you tell me again
 - I don't want to be called a nanny
 - no phonecalls
 - specify number of extra hours outside of those hours that I could do
