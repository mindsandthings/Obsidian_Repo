# HOA notes
I read over the parts relevant to us (pp31-37). I don't know how seriously they enforce it but I wanted to note that it's designed to enforce people parking cars only in the garage, in case that's an issue. 
* The lease says we can park cars in the driveway; the HOA says we can't. 

* We can't store stuff in the garage if it would "prevent its use as parking space for the number of vehicles the space was designed to contain". 
* No street parking; if you or a guest park on the street they may tow you. There is unassigned common area parking for guests to park, but residents are not allowed to park there. (I'm not sure what the common areas are - I guess near the playground?)

Some other things I wouldn't have expected:
* No washing or drying clothes, towels, or carpets outside (no clothes lines, no draping things over railings)
* Garage doors are supposed to be closed at all times except for when entering or leaving
* No signs, flags, pennants, banners, kites visible from the exterior except for those permitted by their rules or by statute
* No power equipment without written approval
* Dogs allowed in common area only on leashes
The easter egg typo: Window coverings must be of a color, texture, or material which is "inharmonious" with the exterior appearance of the house.
