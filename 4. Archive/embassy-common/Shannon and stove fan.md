# Shannon and stove fan

Hi Shannon, this is Elizabeth Bartmess. I wanted to check in with you on when our stove fan might be fixed. 

Ok, great. We submitted it seven weeks ago and we can't go out so we have to cook at home and I'm concerned about exposure to fumes inside. 

Aug 19 (seven weeks ago): request submitted
Aug 28: Jorge determined it needed a new part, expected it to take 15 days to arrive (intended to arrive on the 13th, 3 weeks 2 days ago)
Sep 18 (5 days after it was supposed to arrive): I emailed Shannon who replied and said it would arrive on the 23rd (10 days after it was supposed to arrive)
Sep 30 (a week after the revised arrival date): I emailed Shannon, no reply
Oct 2: I emailed Shannon again, who emailed Jorge

We submitted the request seven weeks ago and the 

10/6 3:45pm: I called Shannon, who called Jorge and then called me back. 
Shannon talked to Jorge. He says that the factory we need the part from shut down for several weeks due to the pandemic and that they expect parts to be three weeks late, so he's expecting it to take another three weeks from the original arrival date so "three weeks from today". I mentioned that it was already three weeks after the original arrival date, and asked if there was anything else she would suggest we do in the meantime, and mentioned I was concerned about long-term exposure to fumes from cooking.
She suggested opening the windows when there aren't fires, and asked what we were currently doing. I said that the windows are pretty far away from the stove and we need to keep them closed most of the time due to fires, and that we're running an an air purifier already. She said she would see what she could do and call me back
