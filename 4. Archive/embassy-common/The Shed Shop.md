I called the Shed Shop in Hayward, which is the place Nicole recommended.

\-\- A shed does count toward the total lot coverage. Their smallest shed is 8x10.

\-\- A studio shed (insulated, with electricity, including permit costs) is $20-25k, more expensive than I thought (I'd been looking at their more basic sheds earlier, which are more like 5-10k). IIRC this is similar to the estimates I found online for adding an extra room to an existing house.

\-\- They might be able to use an existing concrete slab, if level, in good condition, and has space far enough away from the property line. They recommend it also be 4" thick and reinforced with rebar but would have to check with the specific city's code.

\-\- Current wait time is 6-8 months due to high demand. (Only about a month of that involves building the shed.)

\-\- It can't be relocated afterward since it would be bolted to the concrete, so I would want to arrange some means of selling it to you or to future owners in case we moved.

My housemates are planning to buy a house, and I would be living in the house and the shed would be my office.

They may also need to build an ADU for their mother - do you know anything about adding both a shed when there's also an ADU? in terms of permits or lot space?

\-\- they have an ADU program but it's on hold

\-\- studios fully built to code. shed counts toward total lot coverage

AC: they can but it would have to be done entirely by us. theirs are wall-mounted.

If there's an existing concrete slab can you use that?

\-\- would need to look at with photos and verify on-site as well. initial guidance: level, good enough distance from property line, in good condition. thickness/deep: they recommend 4" thick and reinforced with rebar but would have to check with city's code

If I were to move later are any elements of the shed reusable for a new shed elsewhere or would I need to arrange to sell it to my housemates?

\-\- right, because of electrical permit because they're bolted down to the slab

Lead time for 120 sq ft or less 6-8 months right now. Larger than that up to 9 months.
