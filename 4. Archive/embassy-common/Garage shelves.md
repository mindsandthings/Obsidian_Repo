# Garage shelves

* ### Boxes to go on shelves
* ### Baby stuff
* ### Lumber
* ### Five bikes, electric scooter, manual scooter
* ### Stuff that doesn't go on shelves easily like vacuum cleaners

### To do:
* ### Measure wall by weight rack. What clearance do I need for electric stuff etc? Is there room for bikes between door and water?
* ### How wide is left half of room - same as to door, or same as to garage heater?
* ### How far away is garage thing from wall? can we put a tension rack in there? How high would the bikes go - would they bump into the ceiling?
* 
* ### Suggest we get shelves 2 deep, with less good storage in back
* ### Look at ceiling. Could we put a tension bike rack somewhere it won't interfere with the garage door opener? If not, we need to be able to lean them against the walls. I don't see 2-bike freestanding ones.
* ### One of the bikes is Bob's.
* ### Put shelves in a U and bolt them together?
* ### Look at scooters
* ### Look into cabinets / low shelves for workbench
* ### tool storage for workbench

### bikes about 68" 
### bikes width going to be about 5'

### scooter is about 42" 

### N

### chest freezer is 56" wide
### 17.5+95.5

### Back of garage to divot in floor: 109.5". If three 18" shelves, would be (109.5-(18*3)=55.5 of clearance, divided by 2 = 2.3 feet.
### Divot in floor to approximately where the ray of light is: 102


### Square footage of freestanding bike racks (2-3) plus scooter

### 1 5-shelf 48": 150
### 4 36-inches: 260 total

### $410 + tax for shelves


### ***edge of water barrel to edge of door is 53". Could put scooters there.  Or maybe low shelves for exrecise equipment


### Starbucks, open trunk
### Cash $200 leave in trunk
### He'll park closer to the actual Starbucks: 6pm 


### 5-shelf 48x72x18: $150

### 36" ones are $65: could get 5 of these instead

### Also suggest: against-wall shelves that are 2 shelves deep


### Garage: 215" effective depth (where you can park a car in without it risking getting hit by the door; i.e., 5 sets of 18" deep shelves if 18" apart, but let's say 4 because of fridge and freezer) x 225.25 width (3.4 x 48" shelves if 18" apart) = 17.9 x 18.8 sq ft

### 5 tiers per shelf gives us 240" linear storage per set of shelves
### 72" high: 14.4" for first 5 shelves and however high for top shelf. Might be better to have 

### Current shelves are 72"

### bike: about 72" x 52" x 27" (widest handlebars)
### 5 bikes, an electric scooter, and a kick scooter
### remember various standing-up things

### boxes against wall about 132", about 5" high, about 19" worth of the 132 is 2-3 boxes deep. Let's call it 3 because of some other boxes. = 170" wide. Suggests 3 and 1/2 shelves if 48" shelves. But I'm not sure it will divide up that neatly, and there's a lot of stuff on the ground. So I think 5 shelves is better, and matches visual estimate of about 5 shelves worth of unshelved boxes. Baby stuff is 1-2 more shelves. 


### Five 36" = 144
### Two 48" = 144
### Total = 288

### 5" of plywood or something

### ***metal U with bolts and a plate



### 336 linear feets 

### lumber and supplies storage
