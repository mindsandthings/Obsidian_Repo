# Leap chair mod notes



 to original post

I have a used Steelcase Leap V2, because I am a smaller person and needed the shallower seat pan. I wanted to add a third-party headrest. I started with the zip tie version ***here***, and found that the head rest was too far forward and a little too high up for me. Here's my solution. 

The photos show a more complicated version with a crosspiece because I didn't have the size of wood I needed, but I think you could do a simpler no-tools version with one piece of wood plus zip ties. 

Materials needed for the hypothetical no-tools version (try at your own risk, I actually did something more complicated, see below):
-- A Steelcase Leap V2. I don't think this would work with the V1 due to the way the top of the chair curves backward; however, you might be able to figure out a modded version.
-- An original Aeron headrest: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XGMF9BX/ 
-- A piece of wood 5" wide x 1/2" thick, and however long you need to be comfortable. You can probably vary the width from 4.75-5.25", but it can't be thicker than 1/2". For the length, I used 17" but you may want longer. I am 5'5" and like to have the curve of the headrest against the top of my neck and not the back of my head. A hardware store can cut the length for you if you ask. If you only want to make one trip you could get multiple pieces of wood in slightly different lengths.
-- Plastic zip ties. I recommend ten 18" zip ties plus extra in case you mess up and need to re-do something. You can also use shorter zip ties and do more daisy chaining (daisy chaining is when you stick one end of the zip tie through another zip tie, instead of through itself, so that you now have one zip tie that's twice as long). 
-- A scrap of fabric if you want to keep the bottom of the wood from potentially scratching up the back of your chair. 

Steps for the hypothetical no-tools version: 
1. Slide the piece of wood down through the bar on the back of your chair. The bottom should rest about on the bottom chair slit. The top will be near the top of your chair.
2. If you're using a piece of cloth to prevent potential scratches, put it under the bottom of the wood,  where it meets your chair. 
3. Stabilize the top of the piece of wood: run a zip tie around one side of the piece of wood, below where the bar is. If needed, daisy chain your zip ties to make them longer. At the top of the bar, there are two protrusions that connect your chair to the bar. Run the zip tie up and around the bar and around the protrusion on the opposite side. Don't pull it all the way tight yet!! Repeat for the other side. When you are done, the zip ties will look like an X.
4. Stabilize the bottom of the piece of wood. You will need to daisy-chain zip ties even if you are using 18" zip ties. Run one around one side of the piece of wood, then around the bar on the opposite side. Don't pull it all the way tight yet!! Then, do the same for the other side. 
5. Make sure you have the wood positioned right in the center, and with the bottom part resting at or close to the bottom chair slit. Carefully pull all the zip ties tight, checking the positioning while you do so. When you are done, the wood should not move if you try to wiggle it back and forth.
6. Add the headrest: hook the top hooks over the top of the wood. The bottom hooks will not hook onto anything; they will just rest against the wood.
7. Zip tie the headrest to the chair bar: run a daisy-chained zip tie over the TOP of the top hook and around the OPPOSITE protrusion that attaches the bar to your chair. Then, do the same for the other side. 
8. Check that it's at the right height. Adjust the headpiece to see if you can get a comfortable fit at whatever positions you will use the chair in. The headpiece itself has two joints, one that you can always move and one that locks in place with a lever. Adjust both. If you can't get a comfortable fit, you may need to try again with a longer (or shorter) piece of wood. 
9. If it doesn't feel secure enough, tighten your zip ties and/or add more zip ties. There is no single way to do this. Feel free to be creative. 


Here's what you need for the more complicated version I actually did, because I didn't have a piece of wood in the right width and because my woodworking planning skill level is still at what could be politely referred to as "mess around and find out". 
-- Everything listed above for the hypothetical version, except your wood will be 3.25" wide and 3/8" thick because that's what I had lying around. This is too narrow for the headrest to hook over without falling off, which is why I had to add a crosspiece.  
-- A jigsaw to cut the wood to the right length if it's not already at the right length
-- A drill, screwdriver, and wrench to use in attaching the crosspiece to the main piece (you are not modifying the chair, just the wood)
-- A piece of wood 5.5" x 2.75" x 3/8", for the crosspiece the headrest hooks over. I used a piece of the same baseboard(?) stuff but shaved it down from 3.25" with a jigsaw so that the bottom hooks would go around it, although they actually wound up not touching it at all and I think this step wasn't necessary. 
-- To fasten the crosspiece to the main piece: bolts of an appropriate length, nuts, and washers if needed since my nuts were some kind that didn't screw on all the way to the bolts and otherwise it would have been loose

Abbreviated instructions for the complicated version I actually did: 
1. If needed, cut your pieces of wood to the right sizes with the jigsaw
2. Drill 2 holes in both pieces of wood, to bolt the crosspiece on to one end of the longer piece. Bolt it on with the nuts/bolts/washers. 
3. Follow steps 1-5 above to get the wood securely in place. The crosspiece goes at the top because you'll attach the headrest to it in the next step. 
4. Run a zip tie over the top of one hook and down around the headpiece on the opposite side. Repeat for the other side. 
5. Follow steps 8-9 above to make sure it's comfortable and stable.
