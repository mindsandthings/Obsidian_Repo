# HHD 2019 prayer excerpts
**Ut'shuvah ut'filah utz'dakah ma'avirin et ro-a ha-g'zeirah.**
Turning/changing, prayer, and charity change the decree {path}.
[Generosity including to ourselves]

**Min hameitzar karati Yah anani vamerchav Yah.**
/Psalm 118: From the narrow place I called to Yah, who answered me by widening Yah./

**V'kol d'mamah dakah yishamah**
/And a still small voice can be heard./

Adonai, compassion, and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in kindness and truth. Preserver of kindness for thousands of generations, forgiver of iniquity, willful sin, and error, and who cleanses.  

**Elohai n'shamah shenatata bi t'horah hi**
/Elohai, the soul you have given me is pure./
  
**O-zi v'zimrat yah va-y'hi-li lishuah**
Yah is my strength and song, and will be my sustenance and protection [what pulls us out of harm's way]. 

Who can discern their mistakes? Clean me from unperceived faults. Also from intentional sins, let them not rule me.
