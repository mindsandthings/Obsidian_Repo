## Highlights
It will take deeply compassionate insight for the therapist to realize that the client has so few resources that they cannot afford to risk losing any, — location: [43](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=43) ^ref-32340

there is no adult caregiver who is reliably available when the child needs an adult. — location: [52](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=52) ^ref-54973

---
This means that the person will be rather like a child trying to live the life of an adult person: they are constantly overstretched, overreaching themselves, having to run to keep up. The traumatization of a neglected person is therefore akin to burnout, because it results from having to do too much with too few resources. — location: [60](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=60) ^ref-16928

---
the scarcity of resources means that a person cannot ever risk losing anything that contributes to their habitual functioning. Because of this, psychotherapy with clients who have been emotionally neglected is very slow, and change can only happen in very small increments and by the addition of new resources that don’t constitute a threat to old ones. — location: [64](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=64) ^ref-4965

---
The experience of being unparented and uncared for will create a person who often feels bewildered by life, as if they had not been taught how to “do” life. This in turn may make situations involving some expression of spontaneity, such as making a choice or being playful, very anxiety-provoking and shame-inducing. — location: [70](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=70) ^ref-36001

---
the impact of emotional neglect in early childhood is as great as the impact of emotional abuse in terms of mental and physical health as well as social functioning of adults — location: [78](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=78) ^ref-26398

---
many psychotherapists struggle to work with these clients, mainly for two reasons: (1) these are clients who look as though they are quite high functioning but who are in reality much more vulnerable than is visible and (2) the therapeutic process is very slow—unbearably so for some therapists. — location: [86](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=86) ^ref-52958

they may come to live in a world that is cold and indifferent, that they cannot influence and that doesn’t give them anything good. — location: [235](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=235) ^ref-12906

---
It is typical of a neglected person that, whatever is not right in their life, there is often no narrative to account for its origin, in the way that a person who has suffered abuse (or a marked loss or a similar event) will have a narrative of, “This happened and it affected me in a certain way, and that’s the reason that I am as I am now.” — location: [251](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=251) ^ref-44071

---
Every loss is huge because there is so little in the first place, so every resource that is present acquires tremendous importance. Nothing can be spared. Every tiny loss threatens their safety. Safety is their primary concern, and they will be incredibly “good,” compliant children and equally compliant adults if it earns them safety. — location: [274](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=274) ^ref-49140

exuberance, reaching for more, and being big, spontaneous, or impulsive are all highly dangerous to neglected children, — location: [278](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=278) ^ref-50657

placating a caregiver will often be second nature and will be privileged very clearly over self-expression, well-being, or happiness. — location: [288](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=288) ^ref-43629

---
One way that ignored children try to cope with the perceived fragility of their attachment bonds is to become extremely sensitive to the mood of others in an effort to preserve what little closeness and safety they have. Sadly, it does not appear to be possible for such small children to be so focused on another without losing awareness of themselves. — location: [292](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=292) ^ref-16375

---
Mostly these ignored children live in a very lonely world, where nobody is on their side, nobody understands, and nobody can make it better. Getting used to this deep loneliness and finding little crumbs of safety and predictability in their environment is an important coping strategy for them. — location: [300](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=300) ^ref-14489

---
Making themselves small and trying to fade into the background is one way that ignored children may try to cope with both their vulnerability to stress and their uncertain welcome. In adulthood, this means that they will be shy and quiet and show signs of low self-esteem, such as being compliant, diligent, and overly adapted. — location: [308](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=308) ^ref-21872

Mortimer is incredibly alert to the moods of important people around him and, when busy attempting to read another person, loses the ability of being in contact with himself and knowing how he feels. — location: [320](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=320) ^ref-26776

If others try to reach out to them and make contact, they may avoid responding because they feel burdened by the demands of such contact. — location: [327](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=327) ^ref-58123

---
In therapy such people often get the wrong treatment because therapists see a high-functioning person and expect them to change rapidly in accordance with this. Therapists may also feel that it is possible to challenge these clients in ways that are devastatingly shaming for them and don’t produce any therapeutic result. — location: [345](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=345) ^ref-38120

They will almost certainly attach more shame to the fact that they cannot entirely hide their shameful selves. It feels shameful to be anxious and insecure. It feels shameful not to like boisterous and rough-and-tumble games with other children. It feels shameful to find that they don’t enjoy going to clubs and large parties in the same way others do. It feels shameful to be inhibited and socially awkward and unable to make friends easily. It feels shameful to merit the label “introverted” or “avoidant.” And in addition to that, it feels shameful not to be able to just change all this. Ignored children typically live with a sense of constantly letting themselves down and having no one but themselves to blame for their misfortunes. — location: [379](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=379) ^ref-58253

Norman seems the least shame-bound client of the four. His solution, a lifestyle in which he avoids contact with others a lot, has freed him from much of the necessity of feeling ashamed. — location: [401](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=401) ^ref-6411

---
it may feel to a person who was an ignored child that it is only their own internal criticism that ensures they remain perceived as a good person and therefore remain safe. We can assume that this habit of self-criticism gives us a window to the internal world of a very small child indeed, who has to construct an internal parent to keep safe. Such a precocious internal parent would appear to be almost inevitably harsh and critical to an extreme degree. — location: [409](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=409) ^ref-27943

---
Therapeutic approaches that are based on an ability of the person to change at will are almost certain not to succeed with ignored children. Because the self-criticism is so necessary for the safety of the person, stopping it is not possible — location: [417](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=417) ^ref-62473

---
shame, and its resulting inner critic, is the only internal caregiver ignored children have available to them. — location: [435](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=435) ^ref-65457

---
the recognition that the internal critic is a clumsy attempt at creating an internal parent (by a very little person who doesn’t have the knowledge or the skills to create a more sophisticated one) often helps therapists out of this enactment. — location: [437](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=437) ^ref-48852

---
Shame cannot be discharged in the same way that anger or grief can, through cathartic expression, but it will gradually dissipate when it is brought into contact with another person who does not judge but accepts. — location: [446](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=446) ^ref-6349

---
Learning what there is to learn for themselves is a part of this enforced autonomy, the result of caregivers who don’t provide for the needs of their children. For many ignored children, this works really well on an intellectual level. Typically, ignored children are bright and learn at an early age to use their intellect in order to work out how to cope with life (including how to deal with the relentless internal criticism that helps them preempt and to some extent avoid shaming attacks). — location: [453](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=453) ^ref-41704

---
some of the shame that emotionally neglected people feel is the result of developing ways to manage their own feelings that have not been learned in contact with others and thus acquire a secretive quality that feels shameful. — location: [459](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=459) ^ref-32520

---
any skill that involves feelings requires the person to be in contact with their own body sensations, because feelings and emotions are inextricably linked to the physical body and its processes. Ignored children who have learned to numb their fears are typically not in good contact with their own bodies, thus further hindering their own emotional development. — location: [462](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=462) ^ref-38273

---
Sometimes therapists of clients who so stubbornly resist change attempt to interpret this resistance to the client and to challenge them into giving it up. In my experience this almost never works. — location: [468](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=468) ^ref-27427

Figuratively speaking, there will not be an inner grown-up inside who can take the inner child by the hand and look after the child in the transition. — location: [474](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=474) ^ref-56490

Moreover, this internal poverty often connects to a sense that the world is full of impossible demands and that the person is utterly unable to meet these demands. Instead of experiencing opportunities for learning as motivational and as a challenge to be risen to, such opportunities turn into mountains that the person completely lacks the wherewithal to tackle, and they therefore collapse into resignation and more shame. Of course, therapy can also seem such an impossible demand, and therapists need to be aware of the necessity of keeping challenges small enough so that the person can easily meet them. — location: [482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=482) ^ref-3504

---
However, clients with large developmental deficits may have anxieties that simply are not based on such internal conflicts; or there may be internal conflicts, but when we start to explore these, we quickly find that they cannot shift because there are not enough internal resources available to allow a movement of what is experienced as an extremely precarious balance. — location: [502](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=502) ^ref-16443

---
We are badly in need of novel therapeutic approaches that work more effectively for people who are not caught in internal conflicts, but simply do not feel safe in the world. — location: [506](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=506) ^ref-7943

For ignored children whose needs are not being met by the outside world, and who have no expectation of this happening, it is an extremely ingenious coping strategy to care for others. First of all, it may cause a preoccupied, depressed, or otherwise emotionally unavailable mother to become friendlier and more affectionate if the child can meet some of her needs or at least adjust their behavior to minimize troubling Mother. Second, an ability to care for others gives the child a little power and a little sense of their own goodness. They won’t feel quite so small and insubstantial if they can give something to another and thus have the power of making someone else better. Third, the child may experience vicariously how happy the looked-after person now feels, and while this is not exactly the same as feeling happy oneself, it can come a close second. Finally, caregiving is a way of doing something better than what has been done to the child: knowing the pain of being ignored, they will not do the same to another human being. — location: [541](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=541) ^ref-51510

---
a successful ignored child can build an identity as someone who is indispensable to others, which may earn them a right to be here and a purpose in life. This coping mechanism allows ignored children to partake in many of life’s experiences so that they can feel more part of the human race and not so isolated. It may well satisfy their social needs and some of their attachment needs. — location: [553](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=553) ^ref-37485

---
positive feedback will likely go to the false self and will therefore make the person feel more fragmented. This can contribute substantially to the tendency of compulsive caregivers to ward off positive feedback. — location: [574](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=574) ^ref-60838

---
It means having caregivers who are not tuned in to the emotional well-being of a child, who don’t see signs of distress (or choose to ignore them), and who don’t reliably respond to a child’s appeal for help, comfort, or empathy. They may act like this out of ignorance, or out of their own psychological problems, or because they are not physically present. It includes caregivers who don’t wonder whether the child is well but assume that they are okay—or don’t want to know. Of necessity it includes caregivers who are often absent, either physically not there or psychologically not present, in the sense of being preoccupied with something else or extremely withdrawn. — location: [594](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=594) ^ref-8584

---
The healthy opposite of neglect is attention, or an experience of being seen, cared about, and held in mind. There is also an unhealthy opposite, namely invasion, and most children experience being invaded as a form of more or less subtle abuse. — location: [605](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=605) ^ref-45846

Those for whom the term emotionally neglected is appropriate have missed a sense of concern, of internal participation, of being seen as separate human beings from their caregivers that is more a measure of the quality of the contact with their caregivers than its quantity.

the caregiver’s good and loving intentions are simply no guarantee that a child will feel cared for. — location: [625](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=625) ^ref-5776

The situation is worse when both parents are preoccupied, so that there isn’t anyone available to go to when the child really needs something. — location: [657](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=657) ^ref-15180

Infants and babies are far more dependent on reliable good contact, and disruptions will have much more serious effects on them than on older children. — location: [660](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=660) ^ref-52409

---
There are probably many parents who don’t particularly enjoy infants and babies but enjoy older children much more, and children of such parents may or may not feel in later life that they were ignored, depending on the severity of the lack of early bonding. It seems to make a difference not only at what age a child was neglected—the younger the child was, the more devastating the consequences tend to be—but also how long it lasted, and whether it ever changed or just continued until the child was grown up (see also Straus & Kantor, 2005). — location: [662](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=662) ^ref-10885

It is important for clients to be loyal to themselves in order to have a good therapy outcome, far more important than to be able to get their caregivers to admit fault or make restitution. Loyalty toward themselves, even a passion for caring for themselves, is a quality that I aim to grow in all my clients.

In people older than about 50 the possibility still needs to be considered that they may have been abandoned for some time as infants or young children if they were born prematurely or with a serious medical condition. In all these cases there may have been a period of days, weeks, or even months when the infant did not have an appropriate attachment figure available, and this can impact the infant very greatly and have lifelong consequences. — location: [692](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=692) ^ref-11369

---
If a person has many experiences of being left in the care of a very depressed parent, they will have spent part of their childhood in a kind of prison where there was too much stillness, not enough contact, not enough play, and too much time having to just wait and be good. — location: [755](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=755) ^ref-52866

---
Some caregivers are so preoccupied with themselves and their own needs that they neglect the needs of the children in their care. In this category fall all the parents who have difficulties taking on the responsibility of being a parent and who will only at times behave according to this role (Gibson, 2015). — location: [758](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=758) ^ref-8060

---
Here we also find mothers who are still children themselves or who are so needy that they feel themselves to be in competition with their baby for care and attention and may end up feeling envious of anything they give their baby. There are also parents who see their children as an extension of themselves rather than as separate human beings. There are those who treat their children as fashion accessories or as the idealized version of themselves that they would have liked to be. There are all the parents who use their children in order to feel loved by somebody (because everybody knows that children love you unconditionally and always will) and in order to get the parenting that they themselves have not had. — location: [761](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=761) ^ref-35773

---
They will most likely also be heavily parentified and may become compulsive caregivers. They will be the people who spend their lives trying to make their parents happy and possibly trying to be something they are not. They may also spend their childhood trying to pacify, placate, or control their parents. They often have a hard time working out later what their problem is, because they may not realize that their caregivers were preoccupied to the point of neglecting them. — location: [769](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=769) ^ref-693

---
I think that in this category we also find the children with the greatest difficulties separating from their caregivers. This is because their caregivers are quite likely to have behaved in an inconsistent way, sometimes caring for their children and sometimes ignoring them, and there will have been no discernible pattern to this inconsistency. Biological experiments have long established that an inconsistent response creates the greatest difficulty in letting go of anything good, and this applies to animals as well as to humans (Crum, Brown, & Bitterman, 1951; Dwairy, 2008; Pittenger, 2002). Children of parents whose availability is inconsistent will spend an inordinate amount of time and energy trying to figure out the pattern or rule. This is a trait that can survive into adulthood and create much misery among those who were ignored children. — location: [781](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=781) ^ref-39702

---
as emotional neglect undermines a person’s resourcefulness and resilience, any traumatic incidents will happen to a person who is highly vulnerable in the first place, and therefore the impact of further stress is likely to be potentiated. — location: [819](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=819) ^ref-6947

---
It has been shown that the nonsensical-seeming little proto-conversations that most people will spontaneously engage in when in contact with a baby are in fact the stuff of attachment (Schore, 1994; Stern, 1991; Trevarthen, 1993; Wallin, 2007). These little sequences typically consist of a beginning (making contact), a middle (interacting) and an ending (withdrawing from the contact). In such interactions babies learn the flavor of human communication and the shape of contact and experience predictability and reliability of good care. In the absence of words, these interactions are carried out through eye contact, facial expression, touch, and gestures. Such proto-conversations have been shown to be highly musical and thus have internal rules and predictability (Gratier & Trevarthen, 2008). They satisfy the sense that seems innate in all of us of story, of processes that happen in an orderly fashion from beginning to end. They are the kinds of interactions that create meaning in a world that might otherwise be confusing and bewildering. — location: [884](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=884) ^ref-51127

---
Avoidantly attached babies are usually very compliant and turn into compliant, “good” children. Tragically, this may encourage their caregivers to ignore them further because they don’t appear to need anything and always present a facade of being fine to the world. In many ignored children, there is no experience that might suggest that the world has any help or support to offer—instead they experience themselves as utterly powerless to affect their environment or elicit cooperation from another human. — location: [905](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=905) ^ref-17685

Now, as an adult, it is one of her beliefs that other people don’t cooperate and will not help—she has to do everything she wants done. Mostly she is capable of doing that, and this capability gives her a good feeling of competence and power, but it is severely unbalanced because receiving support, help, or care are really unknown experiences for her. — location: [915](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=915) ^ref-48065

Nearly always it will manifest in tremendous difficulties separating from attachment figures. We may feel that the person is hanging on to something well beyond the time when it would be much more sensible to give up and go elsewhere. — location: [925](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=925) ^ref-41179

---
Therefore, my sense of ignored children is that they are often on an edge between being avoidantly and ambivalently attached, and their need to hold on to what feels like everything they have got in the world is incredibly powerful. — location: [928](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=928) ^ref-1351

---
Attachment theory has contributed an understanding of parentification as a reversal of an attachment relationship, in which the caregiver uses a baby or small child to meet their own attachment needs. It is easy to see that this can result in a compulsive caregiver personality, if the child’s attempt to parent the parents is at least partly successful and leads to more safety or more acceptance for the child. — location: [942](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=942) ^ref-45094

The feeling of being exposed, both in the sense of being out of the protective circle of parental care and of being laid open to intrusion and possible violation, is an important aspect of the shame that many ignored children experience. It is as though, because of their very insecure attachment, they are unable to control how much of themselves they share and frequently end up sharing too much for comfort, leading to an experience of shame. — location: [951](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=951) ^ref-64036

For clients who were ignored children and who have usually learned early on to not notice anxious feelings, this fine-tuning can represent a very valuable new resource (Rothschild, 2017).

A schizoid person has the expectation that they can never be certain of their welcome and that it is not given to them to partake of the fullness of life’s abundance. Rather, they may live a carefully delineated existence in the margins, in a little niche that provides them with some safety. Safety is not expected to come from other people, who are experienced as being mostly hard work or downright frightening. In addition to all this terror, schizoid characters are full of rage, which makes the terror worse when felt even a little bit, and which may need addressing at some point. — location: [1109](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=1109) ^ref-57436

I think of schizoid characters and ignored children as next to each other with a large overlap, but with the distinction that ignored children may not feel hated, just ignored. The result is that ignored children don’t have a narrative of how unpleasant their treatment was and typically think that everything was fine and that they are to blame, whereas schizoid characters may have more of an awareness of themselves as victims of some kind. — location: [1118](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=1118) ^ref-10005

If the caregiver doesn’t meet the baby’s needs, or fails to read them reasonably accurately, the baby will conclude that they have no right to need anything. This central tragedy in a young life usually has one of two consequences: either there will be a huge need inside the person that is ever-present and can never be completely fulfilled (this is called the “collapsed oral character”) or the person will decide not to need anything and will spend their life making sure they don’t need anything (this is called the “compensated oral character”). — location: [1151](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=1151) ^ref-23925

Sometimes this has created so much hardship for the child that they have done their best not to even perceive their needs. This will then lead to a situation in which the ignored child doesn’t know what they need. Usually one need that the person will still try to fulfil is the need for an attachment relationship. So the ignored child will spend a large part of their life looking for a parent, an authority figure, or somebody to look after them and keep them safe. Often this is combined with a yearning to belong with a group or tribe that the person can identify with and in this way fulfil their attachment needs. — location: [1162](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=1162) ^ref-50444

If the “bad” is located largely in the person, the resulting character style will be more schizoid; if the “bad” is located in the need, the resulting character style will be more oral.

If a movement is discouraged early in the appropriate developmental stage, the result will be a hypo-responsive muscle, representing a giving up and later avoidance of the movement. This scenario is likely to represent the functional equivalent of a developmental deficit. On the other hand, if a movement is discouraged in the late phase, the result may be a hypertonic muscle representing an often frustrated inability to let go or an ambivalent or conflicted attitude toward the movement. This latter possibility is likely to represent the functional equivalent of a developmental conflict. The assumption that hypo-responsiveness derives from early injuries and hyper-responsiveness derives from late ones does not hold completely true, because when something extremely dramatic happens in the late phase of a developmental stage, a child can respond by retreating entirely from this developmental stage and falling back onto an earlier stage, thus resulting in hypo-responsiveness with regard to this developmental stage (Holm Brantbjerg, personal communication, 2019). For the purposes of this text, we can assume that ignored children are often not encouraged to seek new experiences and often end up fearing them. Therefore injuries early in developmental stages with resulting hypo-responsive muscle groups will be common among — location: [1243](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=1243) ^ref-16260

if we explore movements and muscle groups that are hypo-responsive, we may gain access to the experience of being neglected and ignored by our caregivers. More importantly, we can also experience the movements and muscle groups that are well developed and gain a sense of being better resourced from such an exploration.

We can see from this simple model how clients who were ignored children may be more vulnerable to traumatic events than others, by bearing in mind that the ability of their parasympathetic nervous system to downregulate the sympathetic nervous system is not very strongly developed. Therefore, when there is a powerful activation of the sympathetic nervous system by an external event, the activity of the whole autonomic nervous system may more easily increase into the domain where normal regulation is no longer possible. — location: [1500](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=1500) ^ref-42535

The polyvagal theory implies that we have two ways of inhibiting a state of excessive excitement in our bodies and minds: we can either use fear to stop moving and become quiet as a mouse and attempt to be invisible (and this uses the DVC); or we can seek out proximity to another person to make us feel safe and at peace (and this uses the VVC). — location: [1515](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=1515) ^ref-65035

if that experience has been patchy and interrupted before we had time to internalize it properly, then it may not be reliably available to us and we may have to resort to using the DVC to help downregulate the SNS. — location: [1521](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=1521) ^ref-42341

If most of the muscles tense up under the influence of the DVC, the result will be a state of tonic immobility, or frozen stiffness, whereas if most of the muscles go limp in response to the DVC, the result will be a more collapsed state of utter surrender to what is happening (and potentially preparation for death). — location: [1538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=1538) ^ref-33321

---
Another scenario is shame that may not be the person’s own but somebody else’s. This then becomes like a second-generation trauma: a distressing feeling for which the person has no narrative, because the feeling was somebody else’s in the first place. The phenomenon is common among children with depressed mothers. We need to remember that children with highly insecure attachments are prone to resonating strongly with their caregivers—they generally become exquisitely attuned to their caregivers and will mirror the negative affect of their caregivers in an effort to create a safer relationship and better emotional regulation for themselves. — location: [1637](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=1637) ^ref-31927

---
Another way of thinking about this mechanism is to view it as an identification with the aggressor—where the aggressor is also the main attachment figure (Schimmenti, 2012). This view helps us understand why it is so difficult to dissolve this shame in therapy: it is part and parcel of an extremely insecure attachment, and to let go of it would imply being able to let go, at least a little, of the attachment. — location: [1644](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=1644) ^ref-55866

The fear of being physically disgusting can poison most of her experiences. “I don’t know where this comes from, but it’s just deep within and I don’t think I will ever be able to get rid of it. I am condemned to struggle with it all my life,” she says. Responding to the first part of her statement I say, “I wonder if it was your adopted mother’s disgust? She might have been preoccupied with her idealized fantasy that babies are all golden and sweet and had not quite allowed for the fact that they can also be rather messy and smelly at times. Might she sometimes have felt disgust and passed it on to you because it didn’t fit her idealized image?” — location: [1650](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=1650) ^ref-19920

He alludes to a situation in which in an attachment relationship the caregiver does not respond to the child, does not mirror the child’s feelings, and does not attune to the child’s experience. He proposes that in that case the child’s need for the attachment contact is so great that they will reverse the attachment relationship and start to mirror and attune to the caregiver. He concludes that this will leave the child with a lifelong sense of terrible inner emptiness that may never be filled. In Cozolino’s opinion large tracts of implicit memory that would normally contribute to our sense of self remain confiscated by the identities of other people and thus can only ever form part of a false and compliant self, being essentially shut off from the person’s deeper vital energy. — location: [1663](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=1663) ^ref-49340

It seems easy to postulate the route by which these children can inherit their mothers’ depression: as far back as the 19th century, Charles Darwin observed that mimicking an affect will generate the feeling of it (Darwin, 1998).

I have further divided this chapter into my “seven major dos and don’ts” for psychotherapy with adults who were ignored children. Here is the list: 1. Create safety. 2. Don’t challenge or confront. 3. Think in terms of deficits rather than conflicts. 4. Dose all interventions small enough to lead to an experience of success. 5. Keep in mind the client’s shame including the shame of having to be in therapy. 6. Always remember that the client may not be able to express disagreement with you. 7. Be aware that good feelings may seem threatening to the client. — location: [1860](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=1860) ^ref-3404

There is a third reason to avoid challenges: ignored children live constantly with emotions that are so strong they can barely be coped with.

It is one of the major countertransference pitfalls with clients who were ignored children for a therapist to challenge their client without quite realizing that the client is not in a position to benefit from such a challenge. The danger here is that the therapist merely reenacts the client’s habitual transference of being shamed, blamed, and bullied. — location: [1991](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=1991) ^ref-54221

Clients who were ignored children present with anxieties that are not the result of unconscious conflicts, as is a typical assumption in classical psychodynamic psychotherapy. This means that many of the interventions of classical psychotherapy, such as interpreting or confronting, will not be therapeutically effective. This caveat is also part of the consideration of thinking about deficit rather than conflict and constitutes a further reason not to challenge or confront. — location: [1995](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=1995) ^ref-59640

the shame results from the inability of an ignored child to bear their experience of being unwanted, unacceptable, or disgusting.

If it seems safe to support the shamed child without attacking the parental introject I will do that; if the parental introject is also in need of some support, or if the identification of my client with the parental introject is still very powerful, then I will give a more neutral response. — location: [2156](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=2156) ^ref-27315

I feel it important to frame my clients’ shame as part of their past experience—a traumatic introject resulting from their early experience of being neglected or of a specific trauma.

One of my favorite exercises, which I learned from David Boadella, is getting clients to push slightly outwards with their arms as they inhale (what is termed an “inbreath”) while visualizing breathing in more space for themselves to be who they are. Once clients have contacted these good and supportive body sensations, they will often feel much braver about using body sensation in other ways later on. It is a good rule of thumb to do any movements on an inbreath (or as “counterpulsation”), because this feels containing and does not generally encourage any type of catharsis that might overwhelm the client.

In early trauma EMDR, we attempt to process memories that are present only implicitly in the form of somatic markers and have no narrative.

therapists need to be open to the possibility that their presence may not in itself be very therapeutic in the early stages of therapy.

we need to appreciate the adaptiveness of their coping strategies and some of the precious qualities that derive from them. Some of these qualities are loyalty, consideration of others, cooperativity, humility, diligence, persistence, self-reflectiveness, a willingness to take responsibility for themselves, and a love of peace. If you are looking for a person who takes their job seriously and will do their utmost to carry it out it properly, you want an ignored child. The same applies if you need a person to sustain and nurture those in need of sustaining and nurturing, or if you need a person who can be patient and dutiful, or a person who is capable of putting themselves in the service of a greater cause. — location: [2909](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08G9TFB8X&location=2909) ^ref-55467

ignored children possess to a great degree the qualities that keep most families and societal institutions functioning, even if they do not take on flamboyant leadership roles and might find those on the whole too stressful.

In the therapy of ignored children, we often encounter clients who feel taken advantage of, dismissed, misunderstood, and exploited by others, whether that be in the workplace or in families. This position in their social environment causes much stress, heartbreak, and powerless frustration to adults who were ignored children. Moreover, individuals who were ignored children are typically not well equipped to deal with these difficulties: they generally find asserting themselves and setting boundaries arduous if not impossible and will be most hesitant to walk away from exploitative relationships.
