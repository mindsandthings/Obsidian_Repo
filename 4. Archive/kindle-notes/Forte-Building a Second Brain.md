## Highlights
Projects are most actionable because you’re working on them right now and with a concrete deadline in mind. Areas have a longer time horizon and are less immediately actionable. Resources may become actionable depending on the situation. Archives remain inactive unless they are needed. — location: [1299](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09LVVN9L3&location=1299) ^ref-30927

In other words, you are always trying to place a note or file not only where it will be useful, but where it will be useful the soonest. — location: [1306](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09LVVN9L3&location=1306) ^ref-46402

PARA isn’t a filing system; it’s a production system. — location: [1329](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09LVVN9L3&location=1329) ^ref-39155

Progressive Summarization is not a method for remembering as much as possible—it is a method for forgetting as much as possible. As you distill your ideas, they naturally improve, because when you drop the merely good parts, the great parts can shine more brightly. — location: [1687](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09LVVN9L3&location=1687) ^ref-7423

A helpful rule of thumb is that each layer of highlighting should include no more than 10–20 percent of the previous layer. — location: [1703](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09LVVN9L3&location=1703) ^ref-30983

---
You have to always assume that, until proven otherwise, any given note won’t necessarily ever be useful. You have no idea what your future self will need, want, or be working on. This assumption forces you to be conservative in the time you spend summarizing notes, doing so only when it’s virtually guaranteed that it will be worth it. — location: [1716](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09LVVN9L3&location=1716) ^ref-50293

Distilling makes our ideas small and compact, so we can load them up into our minds with minimal effort. — location: [1739](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09LVVN9L3&location=1739) ^ref-62730

you are trying to place a note or file not only where it will be useful, but where it will be useful the soonest. Organizing by *where it is going*. 


Layer 1: not the entire article, just a few key excerpts
Layer 2: bolded points
Layer 3: highlighting
Layer 4: (rare): executive summary with a few bullet points summarizing the article in my own words

Rule of thumb: each layer of highlighting should include no more than 10-20 percent of the previous layer. 

Rule of thumb: every time you "touch" a note, make it a little more discoverable for your future self. 

Highlight when you're getting ready to create something. 

Don't make highlighting difficult: highlight based on intuition, not analysis/interpretation/categorization. 

"You have to always assume that, until proven otherwise, any given note won’t necessarily ever be useful. You have no idea what your future self will need, want, or be working on. This assumption forces you to be conservative in the time you spend summarizing notes, doing so only when it’s virtually guaranteed that it will be worth it.

"The true test of whether a note you've created is discoverable is whether you can get the gist of it at a glance." (in under 30 seconds)

# Intermediate packets
There are five kinds of Intermediate Packets you can create and reuse in your work: 

**Distilled notes**: Books or articles you’ve read and distilled so it’s easy to get the gist of what they contain (using the Progressive Summarization technique you learned in the previous chapter, for example). 
**Outtakes**: The material or ideas that didn’t make it into a past project but could be used in future ones. 
**Work-in-process**: The documents, graphics, agendas, or plans you produced during past projects. 
**Final deliverables**: Concrete pieces of work you’ve delivered as part of past projects, which could become components of something new. **Documents created by others**: Knowledge assets created by people on your team, contractors or consultants, or even clients or customers, that you can reference and incorporate into your work.
