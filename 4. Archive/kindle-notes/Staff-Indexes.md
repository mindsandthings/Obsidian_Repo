Resources for indexers. For greatly expanded coverage of the present guidelines, along with alternative methods, consult the second edition of Nancy Mulvany’s Indexing Books (bibliog. 2.5). Anyone likely to prepare a number of indexes should acquire that work. For further reference, see Hans H. Wellisch, Indexing from A to Z, and Linda K. Fetters, Handbook of Indexing Techniques (bibliog. 2.5). — location: [3060](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07653T9QS&location=3060) ^ref-38561
