## Highlights
One example of the situation unique to the Deaf community is the impact of residential schools in the lives of deaf people. With the prevalence of mainstreamed programs today, the role of deaf schools in the lives of deaf people is becoming relatively insignificant. This has created a huge divide between “old-timers,” most of whom attended a residential school, and the newer generation of Deaf community members who did not. — location: [271](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=271) ^ref-10131

---
These primary cultural hallmarks include language, heritage, customs, arts, and family or “cultural players.” — location: [399](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=399) ^ref-6954

---
Finally, because the majority of deaf people come from hearing parents who have no previous experience with the Deaf community, the common pattern of the transmission of culture through family members does not apply to them. — location: [432](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=432) ^ref-8373

---
Throughout this book, we will examine deep elements of Deaf culture to better understand the solutions that have been created by Deaf people for effective living. Along the way, we will discover how these solutions have corresponded with the evolving nature of the Deaf community. We will identify the core values of the Deaf community that have shaped the language, arts, and customs of Deaf people throughout the years. In the end, we will have a clear picture of this dynamic, vibrant community of Deaf people and the culture in which they thrive. — location: [680](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=680) ^ref-62592

the hearing grandchildren of Deaf people don’t learn to sign well, and so the influence of Deaf culture on a family begins to disappear (Hoffmeister, 2008). Almost no vestige of Deaf culture remains in the next generation. — location: [794](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=794) ^ref-60847

---
These terms are: hearing-impaired, Deaf, hard of hearing, hearing, and “hearing-but.” — location: [833](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=833) ^ref-44177

---
To many Deaf people, hard of hearing signals experiences that are closer to those of hearing people. In contrast, hearing people typically view hard of hearing as something that is more related to Deaf people’s experiences. — location: [873](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=873) ^ref-19701

---
Padden and Humphries (1988) explain how the term “hearing” is not just a category of people who hear, but is rather a term used by Deaf people to identify those who are the opposite of who they are. They gave the example of how Deaf students at a school for the deaf often called their opponents during an athletic competition “hearing” even if the competing team was from another school for the deaf. — location: [903](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=903) ^ref-61402

---
Instead, the label Deaf is worn with pride (Moore & Levitan, 2005). It is part of Deaf people’s identity. They want to be identified as Deaf. This stands in contrast to a movement within the disabled community that promotes the concept that disability should not be the major identifying factor in people’s lives (Linton, 1998; Shapiro, 1994). To this end, many disability advocates are in favor of doing away with labels or at least making the disability factor secondary to a person’s identity. — location: [1022](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1022) ^ref-15169

---
Another example of the importance of being informed about people’s hearing status involves a school board at a state school for the deaf. In every school’s publication, there is a list of the names of board members. However, there is usually no mention of the hearing status of these board members. Many Deaf people feel that an asterisk should be added next to each deaf person’s name. — location: [1036](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1036) ^ref-50952

---
Hence, it is more appropriate to consider Deaf people as a linguistic minority rather than as members of the disabled community. — location: [1053](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1053) ^ref-62076

---
They include “ASL users,” “signing people,” “seeing people,” and “People of the Eye.” — location: [1056](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1056) ^ref-742

---
(Bahan, 1989; Grushkin, 2003). Yet, after wrestling with newer labels such as “hearing-impaired” and “people with hearing loss,” members of the Deaf community have come to a consensus that the traditional label of “deaf” is preferable and should be seen as inclusive of all deaf and hard-of-hearing people with varying types of hearing conditions and life experiences (Moore & Levitan, 2005). — location: [1123](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1123) ^ref-25244

---
Instead, there are at least seven different possible categories that one can ascribe to deaf people including balanced bicultural, Deaf dominant bicultural, hearing dominant bicultural, culturally separate, culturally marginal, culturally isolated, and culturally captive. — location: [1214](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1214) ^ref-51305

---
Balanced bicultural Deaf people are individuals who are truly comfortable in both the Deaf and hearing communities. — location: [1218](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1218) ^ref-6154

---
Yet, it is important to note that speaking ability is not the deciding factor. — location: [1221](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1221) ^ref-44973

---
Deaf dominant bicultural individuals function well around both Deaf and hearing people but, if given a choice, they would choose to be with Deaf people or, more specifically, people who can sign. However, they would invest time and energy to make their contacts with hearing people as effective as possible. For example, they might teach their neighbors — location: [1223](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1223) ^ref-5089

---
Hearing dominant bicultural deaf people are individuals who can function well within the Deaf community, but who, for one reason or another, have relatively limited contacts with other Deaf people. — location: [1233](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1233) ^ref-62833

---
This does not mean that these individuals shun the Deaf community, but opportunities to interact with Deaf people are few and far between. — location: [1236](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1236) ^ref-27466

---
Another example of someone with a hearing dominant bicultural identity is a Deaf person who has a unique hobby or interest that is not prevalent in the Deaf community. — location: [1241](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1241) ^ref-54287

---
A culturally separate Deaf person is someone who intentionally keeps contacts with hearing people to a minimum. After years of frustration with hearing people due to communication obstacles, patronizing attitudes, insensitivity, and oppression, Deaf people with this identity may decide that to live more effectively they need to avoid situations in which awkward interactions with hearing people are required. — location: [1248](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1248) ^ref-23795

---
They are members of the Deaf congregation of a local church or temple. They bowl in a Deaf league. They participate in a weekly basketball games at the Deaf club. They serve as officers in an all-Deaf investment club. They have Deaf spouses. Almost all their friends are Deaf and they are fine with this situation. — location: [1256](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1256) ^ref-48772

---
A culturally marginal individual does not feel at ease in the Deaf community, but does not feel part of the larger, hearing society either. Perhaps this person does not speak or hear well enough to function comfortably among hearing people and, at the same time, does not possess sufficient sign language skills to fit into the Deaf community. Often, both Deaf and hearing people avoid this person because of difficulties with communication and also because of his or her limited social skills. As a result, this person feels marginalized. — location: [1258](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1258) ^ref-52080

---
A culturally isolated individual chooses not to be affiliated with the Deaf community. The Deaf perspective dictates that to reject sign language and the Deaf culture means a life of isolation and loneliness. The Deaf community is full of “oral failures.” “Coming home” to the welcoming Deaf community is frequently the most important milestone for Deaf people. For — location: [1262](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1262) ^ref-40742

---
Finally, there are individuals who grew up without any knowledge of the Deaf community. — location: [1274](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1274) ^ref-36740

---
These deaf individuals are considered culturally captive. — location: [1279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1279) ^ref-63197

---
The journey to “Deafhood” is often necessary in order for Deaf individuals to create a comfortable and secure place for themselves within their own cultural groups and in the mainstream. — location: [1309](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1309) ^ref-50623

---
The five stages are: conformity, dissonance, resistance and immersion, introspection and awareness, and these will be examined in the context of the Deaf experience. — location: [1312](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1312) ^ref-61717

---
Many deaf people also grow up in the conformity stage; they have no appreciation of Deaf culture and even shun it because of the negative messages they have received from parents, as well as professionals such as teachers, audiologists, and speech pathologists who completely discount the value of Deaf culture. — location: [1321](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1321) ^ref-25722

---
The next step in the cultural awareness model is the dissonance stage, in which the person is exposed to the positive aspects of the stigmatized community for the first time, which triggers a reevaluation of his or her affiliation with this group of people. — location: [1328](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1328) ^ref-49530

---
So, for many deaf individuals, meeting successful Deaf people is a powerful experience that gives them hope for a more rewarding life. Such encounters are often needed for them to progress from the conformity stage to the dissonance stage. — location: [1341](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1341) ^ref-10629

---
In the following stage, resistance and immersion, individuals from disenfranchised groups become determined to learn more about their cultural identity. — location: [1343](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1343) ^ref-24750

---
these individuals often become angry at the deception they were previously led to believe about others like them. Consequently, they shun contact with the mainstream culture because of the pain and self-hatred they experienced while growing up. In this sense, during this stage, African Americans want to be as “black” as possible, Jews try to live a completely Jewish life, and Gay individuals embrace — location: [1344](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1344) ^ref-6399

---
People in the succeeding stage, the introspection stage, begin to reexamine the extreme stance they may have adopted in the previous stage. They realize that their effort to be as Deaf possible does not always result in a positive outcome. — location: [1357](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1357) ^ref-29542

---
In this process, new and more appropriate role models are often identified. For example, instead of looking only to people from Deaf families for guidance, they start to seek solutions from those who had hearing parents and upbringings more similar to their own. — location: [1361](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1361) ^ref-40969

---
People in this stage begin to formulate new ways of thinking about who they are, what it means to be a member of the Deaf community, and how they want to relate to their families and the hearing world at large. This introspection leads to the final stage, the awareness stage. Here, Deaf people come to terms with being Deaf. They are at peace with themselves and their relationships with their families and other hearing people. They have achieved fuller control of their lives. For example, they use or do not use their speech at their own discretion, — location: [1363](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1363) ^ref-42407

---
They adopt whatever is their authentic identity, whether it be a bicultural identity or a Deaf-oriented lifestyle. — location: [1370](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1370) ^ref-28842

---
By the time of their graduation from Ohlone, they are able to achieve a healthy bicultural identity and are ready for a comfortable existence in the world, both with Deaf and hearing people. — location: [1378](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NR5W4OA&location=1378) ^ref-1898
