## Highlights
When the valley of the Fleet river was being cleared in the middle of the nineteenth century the pavement of an old street was discovered at a depth of 13 feet; the paving stones had been worn smooth by the passage of traffic and by innumerable footsteps. Below this street were found piles of oak, hard and black, of which the purpose was not clear. A few feet below the oak were ancient wooden pipes, which were essentially the hollowed trunks of trees. All these layers of city history were packed so tightly together that they formed a solid mass of clay, gravel, wood and stone. Just at the level of the street, a great number of pins were scattered. Whether they were hairpins, or sewing pins, the sources do not reveal. — location: [164](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004KPM16M&location=164) ^ref-47798

The task of hiding the Fleet was more or less complete. Yet it was not wholly or safely buried. In 1846 it blew up and its fetid gases, as well as its waters, escaped into the outer world. — location: [601](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004KPM16M&location=601) ^ref-28587

Evidence also exists from the Roman period of coins and pottery, of rings and glasses, of leather shoes and wooden writing tablets, of spatulas and hooks used for surgical purposes. Three keys from the medieval period had dropped down to the Roman level. The foods of various periods—the fruits, the nuts, the cereals—have been found. All the panoply of early London life is here. — location: [608](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004KPM16M&location=608) ^ref-23250

Two Roman images, of Bacchus and of Ceres, had been flung into the waters; the Mirror of 22 March 1834 also reported the discovery of “a considerable number of medals, with crosses, crucifixes and Ave Marias engraved thereon.” — location: [621](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004KPM16M&location=621) ^ref-21349

Buried in the debris of the Fleet were toys, vessels, tobacco pipes, wooden panels, brooches, pots, bowls, jugs, buckles, pins and pieces of fabric. On one tile was imprinted the fingermark of a small child. It is liquid history. — location: [630](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004KPM16M&location=630) ^ref-32099

They found metal spoons, iron tobacco-boxes, nails and pins, bones, marbles, buttons, pieces of silk, scrubbing brushes, empty purses, corks, candle-ends, seed, pieces of soap, false money and false teeth; these objects were the relics of Victorian London, scavenged by outcasts. — location: [727](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004KPM16M&location=727) ^ref-24436

William John Cavendish-Bentinck-Scott, the fifth Duke of Portland in the middle of the nineteenth century, is best known for his obsessive desire to build a system of underground tunnels beneath his estate of Welbeck Abbey so that he could travel unobserved. He never wanted to be seen; he did not wish to speak to anyone, or even be noticed by his own staff. The underground world represented for him safety and invisibility. — location: [949](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004KPM16M&location=949) ^ref-54199

---
In the depths of the new system were uncovered pieces of Neolithic pottery and Roman tiles, a twelfth-century quay, a thirteenth-century gatehouse and a fourteenth-century wool market. Mosaic floors, and painted walls, have also been identified. When the Jubilee was taken beneath Southwark High Street it found an older street, dating from AD 60, lined with houses of clay or timber; ruts were observed in the street, made by carts and chariot wheels. — location: [1232](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004KPM16M&location=1232) ^ref-60379

Abandoned tunnels run nowhere, known as “dead tunnels,” snaking their way through the living system; they are sometimes damp, and sometimes dusty, with the patina of past time along their walls and floors. — location: [1238](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004KPM16M&location=1238) ^ref-27697

The tunnels beneath the City of London still follow the medieval street plan in order to curb the risk to ancient buildings. — location: [1243](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004KPM16M&location=1243) ^ref-9724

Metal staircases, and chambers, and abandoned shafts, lie beneath the ground; there are brick arches, of the same construction as the nineteenth-century sewers. — location: [1245](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004KPM16M&location=1245) ^ref-18904

miniature city beneath the surface. A journalist from the New Statesman, Duncan Campbell, penetrated this network of underground passages more than thirty years ago. He revealed that there were over thirty access shafts that “connect these catacombs with the surface, most of them emerging unobtrusively in government buildings or telephone exchanges.” — location: [1506](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004KPM16M&location=1506) ^ref-42652

Two huge subterranean facilities in the East End, “Tilbury” under Commercial Road and “Mickey’s Shelter” under Stepney, became havens for the local population. Mickey’s Shelter was named after a hunchbacked dwarf, by trade an optician, who organised the 10,000 people taking refuge with authority and resolution. He was one of the kings of the underworld. He had come forward in the face of the inaction of the government. The people had taken over the shelter and ran it for themselves. The administration had to all intents and purposes abandoned them. — location: [1618](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004KPM16M&location=1618) ^ref-36676
