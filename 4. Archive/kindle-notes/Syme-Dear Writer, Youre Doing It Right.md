## Highlights
More than ever, we need to find ways to bring some of those thought trains (the worry, the preparation, the constant vigilance) into the certainty station. We need to develop ways to cope with extra vigilance (not just about the pandemic, because that’s only one set of traumatic events… there are more, and there will be more). — location: [189](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=189) ^ref-21969

---
If you are a person who finds certainty in work and in being busy, then I hope that you will allow yourself to do the hard work and to focus and lock in to what you want to accomplish. — location: [195](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=195) ^ref-2161

---
We need to be more conscious about what brings us certainty. The more constant the stress, the more important this is. And specifically, we need to look for certainty in places other than the uncertain. — location: [196](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=196) ^ref-3914

---
I encourage you to look back on how you have been resilient in the past. How have you gotten through things? Who have you turned to? Who have you followed? Who have you placed trust in? Who has brought you comfort? It’s time to turn to those places again. — location: [202](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=202) ^ref-7856

---
The danger in times of stress is that we want to isolate. Especially those of us who are hyper-competent. If you need support, please find it. — location: [204](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=204) ^ref-14518

---
If you are a person who consistently needs momentum in order to move, and you can tell the difference between the times when you do have momentum and when you don’t, then you’re going to have to stair-step your way up out of the inert-ness of “inaction” block. Remind yourself that momentum takes canalization, and go back to the pattern you’d had in the past. (Waking up at the certain time or sitting down — location: [328](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=328) ^ref-19720

---
If you tend not to need momentum in order to act (you can act by catalyst, on your own power), then I want you to open the manuscript and write the sentence: “and then everything changed.” If that’s not right, then erase it and write something else. But often, with inaction block, it just takes that catalyst of putting the words down to unstick. — location: [332](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=332) ^ref-38633

---
Some people need quite a bit of pressure to get the words out. This tends to happen when the brain needs a lot of “thinking” time in order to progress, or when a person is an extreme external processor (verbal processor). — location: [335](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=335) ^ref-14572

---
When you have too many things going on, there’s often an excess of pressure from a source other than the writing. If you can’t deconstruct that pressure, then you have to find a way (like a preorder deadline or a paid editorial deadline that can’t be changed) to create the pressure. — location: [345](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=345) ^ref-47579

---
When your brain needs pressure, it doesn’t always have to be long-term, painful pressure. Sometimes, it can be as easy as being forced to talk about the book with someone else. The pressure of the dialogue can help to create that pressure. — location: [347](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=347) ^ref-58305

---
Narrow the stimulation. Write before you get on social media. Write before you talk to friends. Write before you open yourself to all the stimulation. This type of “stuck” can also sometimes need to externally process (a lot of highly distractible people are also external processors), so I would make sure to put that on your Stuck List. — location: [351](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=351) ^ref-39493

---
When you don’t have a skill, you can’t use it. If you’ve never developed the ability to compartmentalize (and I’m just gonna say: some of us are uniquely wired not to be able to compartmentalize already), you’re not magically going to be able to compartmentalize when you’re moving across the country and need to be able to learn how to write during that kind of instability. — location: [377](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=377) ^ref-27228

---
if you tend to get proximity stuck, on a regular basis, and find that your Stuck List is going to look at lot like “get through the time of instability,” then I highly recommend working on a program that’s designed to increase skills around anxiety, obsessive thinking, etc. I always recommend the behavioral training programs because they’re the most effective for long-term change (CBT, DBT, EBT), but even just developing a skill like the Five Second Rule can go a long way to coping with the “stuck” feeling. — location: [380](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=380) ^ref-17096

---
The next time you’re stuck, do “business as usual.” Let yourself have the distractions. Don’t change anything. Note at the end of each day, how much progress you made. Specifically, we’re looking for “do I see the story more now” and we’re looking for additional clarity about how to proceed. — location: [395](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=395) ^ref-45241

---
Then, we’re going to experiment with the fast. You’re stuck. Each morning, hide the phone (and don’t reach for the phone), keep an awareness for not opening apps. (Maybe use Freedom or something similar to cancel the option of even connecting with the apps/sites.) Work as long as you can inside the manuscript. When you need to think, get up and walk away—do something else like dishes or going for a drive or taking a shower. No digital distractions. This is fast week. Keep track of your metrics at the end of each day. — location: [398](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=398) ^ref-51115

---
Your ability to see problems in your own manuscript makes you over-conscious of the mistakes you’re making to such a point that you can’t see the fixes. — location: [445](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=445) ^ref-20705

---
Many of us have brains that also need to be fallow after we write (or in the middle of the writing process). This is incredibly inconvenient. But consider whether or not you meet the following criteria: — location: [485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=485) ^ref-16875

---
You find yourself more motivated to write after you’ve had a drive, a shower, or a day of housework. — location: [489](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=489) ^ref-47123

---
The “plot block” kind of block is just that. What you’ve got planned isn’t going to work, or you can’t see what’s coming next. If you think of a horizontal scale, with “plotter” on one side, and “pantser” on the other side, the closer you are to “pants-ing” on that scale, the more likely you will get plot blocked. — location: [510](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=510) ^ref-15682

---
You see too many potential scaffolds being built on top of the plot you’ve already constructed and they’re making your thinking top-heavy. You need to strategically collapse some of those potential options. (This may sometimes require verbal processing.) Some of them absolutely won’t work, but you need to attack collapsing them with storytelling logic. — location: [513](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=513) ^ref-56221

---
You’re missing a critical piece of information that will help you to know what your character needs to do in the future of the book. This is almost always a “research” thing. You’ve got to go searching for the right piece of information to slide into that little keyhole that will make the door open. — location: [515](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=515) ^ref-4517

---
You’ve subconsciously made the wrong decision just before you stopped (or you’re about to make the wrong decision just after, in the story). It might be as simple as going out the wrong door, so as to meet the wrong person, so as to change the plot in a less high-stakes direction. Almost — location: [519](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=519) ^ref-55603

---
always, this subconscious awareness has to do with the stakes. You’ve somehow kneecapped the stakes. You’re not aware of it. But you have to follow that thread to its logical conclusion to be able to see what’s gone wrong. Again, this often requires feedback of some kind (either someone asking you questions like a beta reader or an editor), or a plot bunny hunter or book coach. It might require out-loud processing, or it might not. — location: [521](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=521) ^ref-56481

---
Typically, this kind of block is serendipitous. It comes with just the right scaffold collapse or just the right key of information or just the right road block. — location: [525](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=525) ^ref-47249

---
When you reach parts of your book that may not be as exciting to you (you’ve already had to plan them out, you already see what happens, you’ve already had that initial blast of the cool idea, and now it’s just down to execution), you’re more likely to shut down. You’re likely to become almost completely blocked. — location: [531](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=531) ^ref-63898

---
Unfortunately, there is not. (Although I have seen Trailblazer writers play games with themselves where they try to come up with a better idea than the one they’ve already had, and it does occasionally work. But sometimes you really need to execute things the way you saw them.) — location: [541](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=541) ^ref-47086

---
sometimes, this block can only be solved by time. What I typically recommend for this kind of block is to stop trying for the day, do whatever you can do to give yourself time away from the manuscript. Watch or read something stimulating and new. Then, very first thing the next morning, open the manuscript and make a deal with yourself that you’ll just try to write 100 words. It might not happen right away, but focus on the sparkly parts and write towards those. It’ll feel significantly better. And whenever possible, do skip the boring parts. — location: [543](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=543) ^ref-48045

Some of us have been burned out on an emotional or spiritual level for much longer than just this year (and to those of us, I say, bless you, because everyone should have a lot more compassion for you after 2020). So talking about “2020” is not to say that any of this burnout is new. But the collective awareness of it (across all sectors of the world) is fairly new. Or, let’s say, new-ish. — location: [617](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=617) ^ref-32542

---
We’ve been doing some interesting experiments in the Strengths for Writers (and our secret alumni) Facebook group recently. A few of writers have been trying to intentionally mark what brings them pennies. Go to the group and look for the “energy pennies” posts by Stefanie London, Kelsey Browning, and Kate Holdsworth. (Or just search for “energy pennies” and all of those posts will come up, as well.) — location: [695](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=695) ^ref-41099

---
Decision Trees are step-by-step yes-or-no questions where each “yes” answer has an outcome and each “no” answer has an outcome. We use these a lot for developing the thinking skills associated with writing. “Do I see what happens next, yes or no?” If the answer is “yes,” then I put, “Sit down at the manuscript, put your hands on the keys, and start writing what I see.” If the answer is “no,” then I ask the next question. “Do I know the motivations for the characters in the scene?” If the answer is “yes,” then I have one action, and if the answer is “no,” then I have another action. — location: [1271](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=1271) ^ref-38298

---
I often see people making determinations about what to write next based on one post they saw in an author group, or one article they saw on someone’s blog, or one conversation on an author discord. They aren’t questioning the premise of any motives of posters or conversants. — location: [1442](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=1442) ^ref-59709

Here are a few examples. 1) When someone tells you they make six figures, is your first instinct to ask, “is that 100K in profits, or 100K in revenue?” 2) When someone tells you they are a bestseller, is your first instinct to ask, “was that just one time, or have you repeatedly hit lists? And which bestseller list?” 3) When someone tells you that they started a blog and it helped them sell books, is your first instinct to look at how similar your platform and timing is to theirs? Or is your first instinct to start a blog, too? 4) When someone says you have to be on social media, is your first instinct to question how effective individual platforms are for actually selling? Are you likely to look at a multitude of different sources to find out whether certain platforms are better for others? Or are you signing up for every platform and taking classes on how to use them? — location: [1490](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=1490) ^ref-39580

The Waiting Period is a period of time you wait before you make a decision based on someone’s advice. It’s similar to The Automatic No (which is saying no to everything first, and then coming back 24 hours later with a yes if that’s what you decide eventually), but this is more about setting a waiting period for yourself. If the decision is driven by adrenaline, then the Waiting Period can be as short as 20 minutes (that’s how long it takes for the adrenaline spike to subside). Or if you really do need to remove yourself from the situation that’s requiring the decision, the Waiting Period might be 24 hours. It depends, from person to person. But set a designated waiting period for yourself, and then every time you feel that someone’s emotions are about to cause you to make a quick decision you may regret later, just enact The Waiting Period. — location: [1508](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=1508) ^ref-41919

---
Three keys to The Waiting Period. 1) Change your state. If you were sitting down, stand up. If you are in the car, pull over. If you are on the phone, hang up. If you are walking, sit down. Whatever your state is when you’ve been called to make the decision, change it. 2) Set a timer or set a reminder. Do not let yourself “wing” the timing. Otherwise, you’re going to come back before the time has expired. 3) Do something else in the meantime. Do not sit around waiting for the timer to pass. Do the laundry. Load the dishwasher. Pay the bills. Go for a walk. Read a book. Make dinner. Do something else while you wait for the timer to pass. As a general rule, don’t watch the timer. Wait for it to go off. Then, the Waiting Period is over. — location: [1514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=1514) ^ref-8389

I went through an intensive therapy program fifteen years ago that lasted for eighteen months and included daily practice. It was an emotional maturity class and they called it “re-parenting” work. Essentially, we were teaching ourselves the skills that we hadn’t learned as children. — location: [1631](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=1631) ^ref-7817

---
some of us are not selling because we’re trying to write for the wrong people. — location: [1663](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=1663) ^ref-16479

---
Iteration. This is similar to the Acceptance tool, in the way it’s practiced. Iteration looks like accepting that what I’ve done hasn’t sold in the past, and the only way to correct what mistakes I’ve made is to iterate. Do the post-mortem. What wasn’t working. Then write the next book. Iterate. — location: [1688](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=1688) ^ref-18683

---
Boundaries. If you’re the type of person who hates to fail, and you’ve been seeing failure after failure and it’s starting to demoralize you, then I would set some boundaries for yourself about how much you’re going to invest. If you have limited resources, set yourself some expectations about how much you’re willing to lose on this hobby you’re wanting to turn into a side hustle. This is why the average “failed” business doesn’t last more than three years. Most people can’t afford to be in the red forever. — location: [1769](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=1769) ^ref-3883

---
If you are putting a lot of pressure on yourself to market correctly or to write to market correctly (which, again, not everyone should write to market, but just for the sake of argument, even when you’re not “trotting” to write to market, you can still write a marketable book), then sometimes, that pressure can break your creative process. (Read the book Big Magic if this resonates.) When this happens, you might want to consider doing an experimental R&D phase where you just write books under a pen name and spend no money and put — location: [1775](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08NCBXJV5&location=1775) ^ref-48113
