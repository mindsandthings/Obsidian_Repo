## Highlights
Shame is the experience of one’s felt sense of self disintegrating in relation to a dysregulating other. Chronic shame develops when many repetitions of such shame experience form a person’s lifelong patterns of self-awareness and response to others. — location: [660](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=660) ^ref-11537

On the other hand, if parents fail to provide a child with someone to look up to, including the companionable invitation to “be like” that idealized someone, the child will not have the self-strengthening experience of idealizing. If there’s a bad fit between the child’s experience of idealized parent and her own ideal self, if the parent fails to respond in an understanding, helpful way to the child’s quest for connection with strength and goodness, then the child will carry forward a depleted self who is forever burdened by an unattainable, unrealistic ideal image of self. Repetitive self-critical thoughts will make self esteem tenuous if not impossible. — location: [924](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=924) ^ref-43965

As in my client Ellen’s story, the parent is often very engaged—but on her own terms and to meet her own needs. Those same personal reasons also trigger the parent’s unpredictable disengagement; it has nothing to do with the child, but the child doesn’t know that. — location: [1524](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=1524) ^ref-21608

She was convinced, If I just knew how to do it better, I’d get what I need! — location: [1529](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=1529) ^ref-13747

To this day, she falls apart into humiliated rage whenever she tries hard for a certain kind of recognizing connection and her hopes are dashed. — location: [1530](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=1530) ^ref-53188

There’s always the chance, she believes, that her performance will guarantee the kind of connection she longs for. — location: [1535](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=1535) ^ref-36518

In a second story parallel to the first, a child needs to experience a sense of intimate belonging with someone he admires and respects; he needs the selfobject experience of being part of that person’s calm, wise, competent power. The experience of being part of this strength brings cohesion and stability to his developing sense of self, — location: [1576](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=1576) ^ref-34983

This is the experience of being very much like another person in sensibilities, interests, and talents, a sense brought to life by doing things together in which the essential likeness can be experienced with mutual recognition, understanding, and joy. 8 — location: [1583](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=1583) ^ref-46577

Kohut’s colleague Ernest Wolf later added efficacy, or the experience that one has impact on the other and can evoke response, and adversarial selfobject experience, which is the need to feel oneself in opposition to another while still secure in the other’s support and responsiveness. 9 — location: [1588](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=1588) ^ref-35835

A parent whose personal shame has kept her own grandiosity under wraps may merge, psychologically, with a “gifted” child in order to fulfill her own unmet needs. Her affective response to the child’s expansive displays of power will feel stimulating to him, but also like too much. He can sense when a pattern of affective response is more about her need for stardom than it is about his own experience of a special self. Perhaps an over-stimulated gifted child can also sense the warded-off shame behind his parent’s need that he be a star. Perhaps the parent’s warded-off envy is also implicitly present between them. In any case, this kind of dysregulating “mirroring”—in which the parent’s face is actually the face in the mirror—can produce powerful chronic shame. — location: [1618](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=1618) ^ref-35325

The moment of being celebrated echoes many formative moments when his expansive affect was met by an intensely dysregulating affective response. In those moments, he was looked at intensely, yet not seen at all. His expansive self saw brightly mirrored a self whom he could not subjectively recognize—because it was a projection of his parent’s need for emotional regulation. The shame produced within this narrative won’t feel flat and empty. It will feel full of anxious, conflicted energy. This gifted child won’t stop trying, even as his shame ricochets between hating the thought of failure and cringing about success. His shame feels like an anxious, unmet longing to be seen for himself and also like an anxious conviction that his moment of being seen will once again be a moment of being mis-recognized, and of then becoming alien to himself and others. — location: [1626](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=1626) ^ref-51538

A powerful, non-verbal kind of modeling helps her know both how to fulfill her ideal and also how to accept herself when she falls short of it. — location: [1641](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=1641) ^ref-3286

The child will still want to look up to the parent, and she will still construct a picture of best self related to the parent, but from a distance. — location: [1646](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=1646) ^ref-10049

More often a client has tried hard to idealize a more likeable parent, admired from a distance. The client wanted to participate in the parent’s strength and goodness but felt shut out of intimate connection. Andrea, emotionally neglected by her mother, longed for such intimacy with her admirable but distant doctor-father. — location: [1654](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=1654) ^ref-7983

---
A child in Andrea’s position has to live up to high standards or face harsh self-judgment. Worse, she has to do so without having had the chance to absorb how to be a strong, wise self who can both make good choices and recover from mistakes. Since her self-regulation around mistakes and lapses takes intense effort, it’s also prone to breakdown. — location: [1660](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=1660) ^ref-29585

---
When there’s no winning and no help, shame feels bitter and full of resentment, too. Sometimes the best “help” is to turn resentment outward, judging others by one’s own high standards. Shame feels less like shame, then, and more like righteous expectation and disgusted disappointment with others. It’s emotionally stressful, though, to live in a world where “nobody gets it right.” — location: [1665](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=1665) ^ref-13815

---
A self needs to idealize—needs to feel connecting, calming strength from another—when that self is feeling weak and unable to manage. When basic idealization fails, a struggling self feels even weaker, more at the mercy of events and emotions, doomed to passivity. 13 This enervating, impotent form of shame will haunt those who were never able to idealize and whose ideal self is a shaky entity in adulthood. It also taints the experience of those who idealized from a distance and then invented an ego ideal based on a childish understanding of “strong.” — location: [1675](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=1675) ^ref-33013

there’s the kind of shame brought on when twinship or kinship selfobject experience fails. If one’s implicit moves to claim likeness with a significant other are rebuffed and if one’s desires to have this likeness shared and enjoyed are ignored, a particular kind of shame follows, a feeling of being an outsider, alien, and weird. Often this feeling is layered on other shame feelings. — location: [1682](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=1682) ^ref-28496

---
She keeps up with a number of friends, both men and women, however, who share some essential likeness with her. These friends are usually marginalized or wounded in some way, but they are also smart, funny, and kind. None of them is “that one special person,” but together they keep Andrea from sinking into unreachable shame and despair. — location: [1694](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=1694) ^ref-33150

They maintain that a child learns to know and accept his own inner states, his own mind, by experiencing his mind as it’s held in the mind of his parent. The parent uses a combination of empathy and imagination to create in her own mind a moment-to-moment picture of what’s going on “inside” the child—his physical and affective body experiences, his emotions, desires, and intentions.

Some clients who struggle with chronic shame as adults remember having been shamed by their parents for failing at school or in sports. But for most of them the shame storyline is more subtle. Some of them remember having to figure things out for themselves and doing them badly without the help they needed. — location: [3605](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=3605) ^ref-48343

---
Others remember constant praise about being smart and talented no matter what they did—but they could never settle on something to be good at. — location: [3608](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=3608) ^ref-30592

I mention studies that show that praise for being smart or talented doesn’t help kids feel good about themselves; instead, praise can just make them more anxious about living up to the mark the next time. 14 — location: [3612](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=3612) ^ref-19300

---
parents who suffer shame themselves feel afraid of failing as parents. They give lots of praise so that they can feel like the good parents of competent, happy children. But this kind of praise doesn’t help the kids. It doesn’t really see them; it’s about the successful, well-adjusted child their parents need them to be. The kids try to keep up the image but without being really connected to their parents or to themselves, which is where genuine self-esteem comes from. — location: [3615](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=3615) ^ref-55567

What these shamed clients needed growing up was close contact with parents who were happy to share skills and knowledge with their kids, and who also saw their kids clearly for who they — location: [3619](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=3619) ^ref-51852

I came to understand that Erin could not be that self whose need for connection once left her open to profound misrecognition and violation. If she had not needed, she would never have become just a pawn of the other’s need, an unbearable experience for her. Her needing self thus became a place of deep, wordless shame, a not-me. In order not to be that self, she closed off all possibilities for further need, misrecognition, and violation. — location: [4419](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=4419) ^ref-18627

“In the treatment of MPD it is important to be as shallow as possible. There is no need for ‘deep’ exploration because the most important material is immediately available on the surface, though the surface is dissociated into separate compartments.” — location: [4540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015CLFM72&location=4540) ^ref-45176
