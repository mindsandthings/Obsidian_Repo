## Highlights
Alignment is symmetry between your self and your systems. Between your purpose, your personality, your platform, your capacity, and your goals. — location: [114](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07N36MHWD&location=114) ^ref-50973

Several of these themes of Strength® cause a person to need more time processing. If a person does their best work when they process information over and over in their head before it comes out of their fingers onto the page (or their mouth, if they’re speaking), why are we trying to short-circuit that process? The most common Strengths® among my coaching clients are ones that take more time to process information (sixty percent of the people who’ve either been coached by me or gone through my classes), so I see this premise a lot. Someone told me I can’t edit a blank page, so I should just vomit the words out onto the page and stop thinking before I write. Well, it turns out, you can edit a blank page. If you have certain Strengths®2, one of the hallmarks of how your brain works is that you’re editing in your head, before you ever put words down on the page. This is part of how you get your gold. In fact, your best work is going to come when you edit the page in your head, instead of on paper or on the screen. — location: [181](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07N36MHWD&location=181) ^ref-2993

First, I want you to think of your favorite books. I want you to quantify, as much as you are able, what you love about them. What keeps you going back? Make that list. I want you to see, by and large, how you talk about what you love about books. — location: [756](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07N36MHWD&location=756) ^ref-26140

What are the common phrases that readers use to describe your books? What patterns do you see in what they praise? What was memorable for them? — location: [770](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07N36MHWD&location=770) ^ref-1205

(which, really, I understand—it’s okay), then talk to a couple of readers or to your editor. Ask what stands out about your books. What’s memorable. What do they love. What are you best at. What’s the best craft element in your writing. — location: [771](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07N36MHWD&location=771) ^ref-28864

Your development plan should consist of targeted learning based on what you’re already doing well. Study the techniques that lie underneath this capacity. Study other writers who do this better than you do. How are they doing it? (Not so you can plagiarize them—let me be clear—but so you can learn from their techniques.4) — location: [780](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07N36MHWD&location=780) ^ref-7431

When you need time and space to think about stories or characters or plots, then you need time and space. — location: [855](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07N36MHWD&location=855) ^ref-15944

Look at the places in your life that are causing you the most difficulty. What is the assumption you’re making that causes the struggle? QtP. — location: [1631](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07N36MHWD&location=1631) ^ref-44226
