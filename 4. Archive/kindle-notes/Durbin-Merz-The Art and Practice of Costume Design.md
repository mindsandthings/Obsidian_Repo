## Highlights
Costume design is the interpretation of written character that is created specifically to live and breathe on the stage or screen. — location: [163](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=163) ^ref-41869

---
It is the job of the costume designer to synthesize knowledge about art, the human experience, clothing, history, script analysis, and the great theatrical endeavor, into the form of specifically chosen garments that aid in the telling of a particular story. — location: [165](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=165) ^ref-23646

---
Costume design defines the period, location, social strata, time of year, time of day, and character development through the use of clothing, accessories, hats, wigs, and makeup. — location: [176](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=176) ^ref-60067

---
Design requires visual artistry and conceptual thinking, but it is equally about accounting and record — location: [219](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=219) ^ref-21448

---
keeping, planning and research, and sometimes psychology and babysitting in handling the personalities of performers and directors. — location: [220](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=220) ^ref-62105

---
• Design is Organization. A designer creates and maintains a range of charts and lists and must be expert at time management. — location: [226](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=226) ^ref-58704

---
A costume designer must be a student not only of theatre and design, but also of visual art, art history, literature, world history, and psychology. — location: [231](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=231) ^ref-11630

---
Fashion as movements can be divided in many ways. The following is one example: Renaissance, Elizabethan, Baroque, Romanticism, Victorian, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, and Modernism. Within these movements, fashion has changed many times as a result of cultural change, advancement in technology, availability of supplies, and even a reaction to boredom. — location: [498](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=498) ^ref-11245

---
Music can inspire the silhouette of a costume by the flow or the staccato of the beat. — location: [765](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=765) ^ref-4177

---
Icons, or an object that represents something else, may be presented in a meeting that catches the attention of a designer. A piece of sandstone looks hard, but actually crumbles easily, much like the reign of Macbeth. Yet the objects do not necessitate direct use in a costume or design. In the example of sandstone, it is doubtful sandstone would be used directly on the costume. However, a designer might look for fabrics that appear strong but rip easily. — location: [768](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=768) ^ref-21166

---
Working in a large costume shop with lots of amenities is a wonderful thing. It is also rare. Designers can do almost anything if they have access to a dye vat, spray room, craft area, and wig area. It is also a privilege to work with fully staffed shops that include cutters, first hands, stitchers, crafts artisans, wig and hair designers, and all the wardrobe people needed for any quick change. — location: [782](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=782) ^ref-40745

---
Does the music call for tap, partnering, or quick movements across the stage? Movement has to be taken into account when considering the design of the costumes no matter what period the musical is set in. — location: [867](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=867) ^ref-50431

---
Hierarchical, Utility, and Seduction. Hierarchical involves dressing to prove position in society. — location: [1120](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1120) ^ref-52540

---
The nine principles of design that most costume designers and visual artists utilize in the creation of their work are: balance, emphasis, movement, pattern, repetition, proportion, rhythm, variety, and unity. — location: [1289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1289) ^ref-6084

---
The placement of every seam, garment edge, pleat, dart, pocket, cuff, or gather creates a line. The finishing or decorative adornment of a piece of clothing also creates a line. Where the designer draws a line tells us something about the character being depicted and helps inform the work of the costume technicians. It lets the cutter–draper know where seams might be placed and what silhouette is desired. The use of particular types of line will also — location: [1298](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1298) ^ref-20558

---
Line is a mark or series of marks that take your eye from one point to another. Line is used to define shape, contours, and outlines. Specific lines can suggest mass and volume. — location: [1304](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1304) ^ref-32056

---
Length describes the distance a line travels on the page or space. A line can travel a short or long distance depending on the intention of the artist. A line’s length can also show inconsistencies. An artist may start a line at point A, travel an inch, stop, and then lay another one inch segment and repeat this pattern over and over until the line finally reaches point B. This creates a broken line. A broken line laid side-by-side with a continuous line will evoke a different power/feeling on the page. — location: [1325](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1325) ^ref-65460

---
Direction lets us know where on the page the line starts and where it is traveling on the page. It is the intentional placement of a particular line with regard to the outer edges of a page or the finished garment on the body of an actor. A line can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. A line can radiate from a center. Lines may also curve or zigzag across the page. — location: [1332](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1332) ^ref-43708

---
Horizontal or vertical lines, alone or together, communicate stability and safety. Diagonal lines may create a feeling of uncertainty and instability for the viewer. Lines that zigzag across a page or the body of a performer may have an air of harsh energy. While softer curving lines may create a feeling of familiarity, relaxation, and sensuality within the viewer. — location: [1335](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1335) ^ref-61582

---
Lines can have focus and feeling. Focus is created by the type of drawing instrument, and the pressure or energy applied to the implement at the time the line is put to the page by the designer’s hand. This can create a sharp, blurry, fuzzy, or choppy line. Focus produces a particular energy within the line itself. This energy is directly related to another characteristic of line: feeling. Feeling denotes the sharpness, smoothness, jaggedness, and/or graceful nature of a line. The direction, focus, and feeling of a line help to communicate information about a character’s inner life. A villain costume may utilize sharp lines like very pointy lapels, hanging sleeves, and a hard zigzag closure across the torso. — location: [1338](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1338) ^ref-14248

---
The aforementioned characteristics of line can be applied to all art forms. In costume design, they can be utilized in the following line types: sketch, gesture, outline, contour, and implied line. Costume — location: [1345](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1345) ^ref-17735

---
A sketch line has a short airy quality and it implies the shape of an object. — location: [1349](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1349) ^ref-29615

---
A gesture line is filled with motion and energy. Gesture lines can capture movement in the fabric and in the body of the character being drawn. — location: [1352](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1352) ^ref-42778

---
An outline creates the outer edge of an object. — location: [1355](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1355) ^ref-61973

---
Shape is two dimensional, self-contained, and created by a single line or several lines that enclose a space. Shapes are utilized throughout the costume design process. They can be seen in rough sketches depicting the human body, pleated and draped garment sections, fabric pattern/print, and accessories. Shapes can be categorized as organic, geometric, positive, negative, static, and dynamic. — location: [1370](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1370) ^ref-27106

---
Organic shapes are free form, irregular, and possess a fluid quality that can convey the energy of movement. These shapes are associated with things we might see in the natural world. They are the gifts of Mother Nature. The shapes of apples, pears, leaves, shells, or butternut squash are varied in nature. The curvature and flowing quality of organic shape has a calming effect on the viewer’s eye. — location: [1393](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1393) ^ref-47604

---
Garment features are all of the structural details that create line and shape: pockets, collars, darts, tucks, cuffs, peplums, and various seams and décor. — location: [1484](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1484) ^ref-34711

---
Some of the most commonly utilized color schemes are: monochromatic, analogous, complementary, split complementary, and triadic. These color schemes are created by grouping colors to create a sense of unity, harmony, or contrast. — location: [1591](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1591) ^ref-52811

---
Analogous color schemes are often used to group families. A designer may use analogous color schemes to depict the Capulets and the Montagues in Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. — location: [1603](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1603) ^ref-42812

---
Split complementary color schemes are created by taking two complementary hues on the color wheel and adding only one of their analogous or adjacent pairs. The addition of these analogous pairs then omits the complementary hue that they surround on the wheel. An example of a split complementary scheme would be orange, blue-green, and blue-violet. This allows the creation of contrast that is not overbearingly bright to the viewer’s eye. — location: [1611](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1611) ^ref-22950

---
Texture, like color, depends on theatrical lighting design to reach the audience member’s eye. It has a strong psychological effect on the viewer. Texture is a great tool for the designer to utilize when depicting class or locale because it ignites a tactile recall in the viewer. This can help convey specific feelings attributed to soft, rough, or uneven surfaces that can be equated to character relationships or the depiction of active and successive events on the stage. — location: [1644](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1644) ^ref-43459

---
several properties make cotton a good choice: it takes dye well and can be overpainted nicely; and numerous sewing techniques can be applied that allow for an added layer of textural dimension, such as gathering, pleating, embroidery, smocking, and trapunto. — location: [1695](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1695) ^ref-26380

---
Cotton fabrics like terrycloth and velvet also have the added texture of pile, which is created by the weaving process. — location: [1698](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1698) ^ref-2301

---
Linen is another plant-based cellulosic fabric. — location: [1701](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1701) ^ref-30371

---
Its yarns can contain slubs: gathered raised sections that do no press out. Such slubs can appear prominently in some natural ecru, ivory, tan, or gray linen fabrics. These slubs, and linen’s natural tendency to wrinkle easily, can give linen a very primitive texture, — location: [1702](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1702) ^ref-26973

---
Silk dyes well and can be an ideal surface for various painting techniques like batik and block printing, — location: [1709](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1709) ^ref-20909

---
Some common silk fabrics used in costume design are noil, chiffon, organza, charmuese, satin, crepe de chine, georgette, shantung, and some brocades. — location: [1711](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1711) ^ref-37883

---
The lightweight silks like habotai, georgette, and chiffon give us a range of delicate movement and are ideal for dance, the portrayal of ethereal characters, — location: [1713](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1713) ^ref-60361

---
Wool is a protein textile fiber. — location: [1719](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1719) ^ref-65247

---
Wool fabrics are split into two families; woolen and worsted. — location: [1719](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1719) ^ref-58315

---
The fibers of woolen fabrics are much shorter and contain a good deal of crimp, hence creating a fuzzier, more uneven, surface. — location: [1720](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1720) ^ref-56583

---
Worsted wools are smoother because they are created using longer fiber yarns that are also stronger and lighter. — location: [1722](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1722) ^ref-50447

---
Wool can also be used to create jersey and knit fabrics. Wool drapes well and holds structure. Seams, pleats, and gathers have a nice crispness to them on a worsted wool fabric. — location: [1724](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1724) ^ref-28730

---
The principles of design are used to organize the elements in a work of art. They include balance, emphasis, movement, pattern, repetition, proportion, rhythm, variety, and unity. — location: [1855](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1855) ^ref-55992

---
Pattern is the replication or reiteration of shape, line, or form throughout the plane of the entire work of art. It works closely with the principle of repetition. Repetition utilizes a pattern of objects, forms, and value to create a feeling of activity in the work of art. When pattern and repetition work well together, there is a sense of unity in the artwork. — location: [1874](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=1874) ^ref-44070

---
Final renderings are based in contract and must be honored by all parties; however, with mutual agreement, final designs are sometimes modified when the realization of such designs is directly affected by a change in casting, issues with fit, or an overall change in the approach to a particular character approved by the director and producer. In any case, final renderings are expected to be fully colored drawings that also include detail, working drawings, and special instruction and research, either directly on the plate or accompanying it. — location: [3962](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=3962) ^ref-57227

---
specialized steps in the construction process. A specific job title does not always mean exactly the same job description from shop to shop; there are regional variances and colloquialisms. For example, the person who is the head of a costume construction team is known as a draper, a cutter, or a cutter–draper depending on which part of the country you are in. — location: [4579](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=4579) ^ref-13542

---
The cutter–draper is responsible for overseeing the creation of the designed costumes. They alter and fit costumes that are pulled from stock or rented. — location: [4598](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=4598) ^ref-21640

---
The cutter–draper is the prevalent artistic supervisor responsible for the construction or alteration of their assigned costumes. — location: [4602](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=4602) ^ref-4478

---
The first or second hand works alongside the cutter–draper in order to take the patterns from the cutter–draper and fit the pieces of the puzzle onto the chosen and appropriate fabrics. — location: [4603](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=4603) ^ref-18463

---
The first hand will assist the cutter–draper in fittings, and then interpret the cutter–draper’s pins, marks, and words. They will collaborate with the cutter–draper to determine the best construction methods for creating each piece. — location: [4606](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=4606) ^ref-3782

---
The stitcher is the person responsible for sewing a costume together or stitching the alterations. They must be proficient in a variety of hand stitches and be skillful in using a sewing machine. — location: [4611](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=4611) ^ref-50305

---
Stitchers must possess basic garment construction knowledge, have an understanding of what fabric can and cannot do, and know how to cleanly finish a costume. — location: [4613](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=4613) ^ref-51406

---
Craft work can be carried out within a costume shop by a separate team, an existing member of the team, or a separate craft shop. Crafts can involve a variety of items or pieces that the designer has specified that do not encompass traditional sewing or garment construction. It might be dyeing fabric to match a specific color; painting fabric to give it a print; or modifying fabric to resemble embellishment. Hat-making techniques will be required if there is millinery work that needs to be done. — location: [4634](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=4634) ^ref-50188

---
“‘Hair/Wig/Makeup Designers’ communicate with the director and cast, and consult with the costume designer, but they are not bound to their renderings or choices. This position/title is rare in regional theater but more common in regional opera where costumes are rented and fit by local wardrobe heads. — location: [4676](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=4676) ^ref-19252

---
“‘Wig Master’ or less commonly ‘Wig Mistress’ or ‘Wig Artisan’ are the titles for the person who builds, fits, alters, styles, and is ultimately responsible — location: [4680](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=4680) ^ref-61032

---
“‘Hair & Wig Stylist’ would be used for someone who is there every day handling both performer hair and the styling and upkeep of the wigs. — location: [4683](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=4683) ^ref-11683

---
The wardrobe person is responsible for maintaining the costumes once the show has progressed to dress rehearsal. This position works primarily backstage and handles getting the actors ready for the show and helping them get in and out of the appropriate costumes, sometimes very fast. They are also responsible for laundry — location: [4690](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=4690) ^ref-50135

---
There are usually at least three people in the first fitting of a costume (the mockup fitting); the actor, the draper, and the designer (and occasionally an assistant). — location: [4853](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=4853) ^ref-8660

---
courses as varied as theatre history, costume history, traditional and computer rendering, script analysis, two- and three-dimensional design theory, color theory, costume construction, pattern drafting and draping, stage makeup, costume crafts, and more. Add this classroom knowledge to some practical learning gained by working on department productions as a dresser, wardrobe run crew, a stitcher, a draper, and eventually, an assistant to the designer, and you are all set to conquer the theatre world as a brilliant designer. Or are you? — location: [5100](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5100) ^ref-26470

---
While preparation for the costume designer often begins with a four-year liberal arts degree, there are many design training programs offered through colleges, arts academies, or dedicated fashion schools, and these can be more focused and shorter in duration than the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Fine Arts degrees. — location: [5108](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5108) ^ref-27067

---
At the other end of the spectrum are the highly specialized, often private schools where intensive professional training is offered in fields such as Makeup, Special Effects (FX) and Hair Design, and Wig Making. Students graduate with functional expertise and a well-developed, specific skillset allowing them quicker entry into the job market, but perhaps without the career mobility of those with liberal arts degrees. — location: [5116](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5116) ^ref-53976

---
The curriculum for designers, costume and fashion designers among them, may include art history, design theory, and rendering in addition to very targeted skill-building courses such as sewing and tailoring, pattern making, draping, and computer-aided design. — location: [5119](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5119) ^ref-34118

---
the training and education required in various design fields is dictated by the employer or company for which the designer wishes to work. Sometimes, emphasis is placed solely on the capacity for innovation and versatility displayed in the designer’s portfolio. At other times, letters of reference hold immense sway, especially when the designer has apprenticed under or worked with recognized names in the fashion or theatre world. Most often, employers want to see evidence of creative output in the form of a portfolio or website, see proof of productive collaborations with others in the field, and have the assurance of future potential that successful completion of a university or college-level degree brings. — location: [5126](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5126) ^ref-55082

---
“soft skills,” are arguably more important than any single course or even major. These include skills such as relationship building, teamwork, problem solving, critical thinking, and communication. Teamed with personal attributes such as a positive attitude, a strong work ethic, developed social skills, and a healthy curiosity, these are the most desirable traits for anyone aiming for a career in design. — location: [5132](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5132) ^ref-41547

---
Both the costume designer and the fashion designer possess an inquisitive spirit, a passion for wide-ranging research, an interest in the history of clothing, an understanding of psychology, a love of fabrics, and an excellent grasp of the principles and elements of good design. They must be very detail-oriented and enjoy working in fast-paced, ever-changing, and demanding environments. Both must be skilled communicators, verbally and especially visually. Highly organized and able to work within strict time and budget constraints, both must be able to contribute as a member of a team. — location: [5195](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5195) ^ref-45873

---
Costume design, whether for a period play, a modern drama, or a futuristic odyssey, is not about shopping for a flattering outfit for an actor; it is about making truthful choices for a specific inhabitant of the story at that moment in the character’s life. — location: [5223](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5223) ^ref-39459

---
Fashion designers also need to have a deep understanding of history, but they rely on their knowledge and quote from it in a very different way to costume designers. Sometimes, they might pull one detail from a period, and that period-specific detail might form the inspiration for an entire line. Sometimes, an historical period or event will reverberate through a collection in a totally fresh and unexpected way. Over time, the fashion designer will develop their own style which is built on the best of what has come before, not to merely duplicate what has already been done, but to understand it in its historical, social, and political context, and to be inspired by it. — location: [5225](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5225) ^ref-22368

---
Understanding that fashion history follows a cyclical pattern and reflects a unique set of social, political, and economic factors enables the thoughtful designer to reference styles that have gone before, and put their own unique stamp on them. — location: [5232](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5232) ^ref-20329

The explosion of the gaming industry has created a market for game character designers and animators who understand fit and fabric drape and movement. There are year-round commercial and custom design opportunities generated by annual Halloween and Mardi Gras events. Marketing for companies from small stand-alone businesses to national franchises, for products as diverse as pizza and sports teams, has spawned the need to create larger-than-life mascots and walk-arounds. — location: [5317](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5317) ^ref-20691

show only your best work; be aware that how you present your work is almost as important as the work itself; highlight the part of the project for which you are responsible (for example, “distressed all costumes” or “costumes designed by”); give credit to any other artists whose work is represented and to the photographer who shot the image; keep the content fresh and current; and, most important of all, make it simple to find and contact you. — location: [5457](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5457) ^ref-40709

Before forming firm opinions or beginning to make design decisions, a designer needs to note their impressions of the large picture the story paints. These impressions are formed in response to the language of the play, its rhythms and textures, themes and motifs, and the arc of the story. — location: [5484](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5484) ^ref-43789

Character information and costume requirements can be gleaned from the playwright’s notes and also from the dialogue; in how the characters talk about themselves and each other, and in how the characters talk to each other. Finding each character’s place in the story—their role in driving the story forward—and understanding their relationships to the other characters must take place before deciding what costumes will best assist in revealing their importance to the story and assisting the audience to understand it. — location: [5488](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5488) ^ref-54239

Development of Ideas Once the central problem is identified, there is a period of research and brainstorming. This stage is about ideation—taking in information from a wide range of sources, and thinking of as many potential solutions and approaches as possible. The object is to generate a large number of ideas without pre-judging them, and staying open to possibility, imagination, and creativity. This phase is likely to involve many more quick sketches than finished renderings, and more gathering of inspirational images and textures than editing. — location: [5651](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5651) ^ref-65481

The costume designer thinks in terms of relationships between one character and another, of characterization, and the story arc of each character. This may involve the evolution of how a character is portrayed from the onset of the story to the end, possibly requiring changes to the character’s age, shape, or size. Whatever the costume solution, it will be unique to this story, this character, and this actor, and must appear as though the character chose the clothes themselves. — location: [5660](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5660) ^ref-47174

Evaluation of Ideas Ideas generated in the brainstorming phase of design must now be evaluated and edited down to the practical, viable, and fitting. For many, this is the most angst-ridden part of the process since it requires discarding some wonderful design ideas that simply do not serve the story or the brand, or are not feasible within the limits that have been identified. — location: [5684](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5684) ^ref-38548

The director may request changes to bring the costumes more in line with the interpretive approach to the script or with the other design elements, and will have final say over which costumes get produced. — location: [5690](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5690) ^ref-30529

Realization of Designs Once the final costume designs are selected and finishing touches are added to the renderings, the costume designer or the design assistant will shop for fabrics that best capture the desired hand, drape, color palette, and construction qualities for each design. Swatches of these fabrics are attached to the renderings so the shop can sort through the large variety of small yardages that make up a typical show. — location: [5693](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5693) ^ref-58759

Mockups, also called muslins or toiles, are made up in inexpensive fabrics to check for proper fit and drape before the show fabrics get cut. — location: [5697](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5697) ^ref-55931

The designer may be the person responsible for drafting the initial pattern, or there may be a person whose sole job it is to create patterns, usually with a computer-aided design program. In mass-market production plants, the designer would then work with a sample sewer to make up a prototype of each design. — location: [5701](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5701) ^ref-39450

Costume Designs Amplify the Truth Costume designers bring another essential skill to each project: a sophisticated understanding of story mechanics. Why is each character in the story?—to act as the voice of reason; or to provide an element of chaos in an otherwise orderly world? Should the audience trust this character? Does an innocent-seeming character turn out to be a surprise villain at the end? Triggering the correct emotional response from the audience at the right moment is a key part of creating an effective story. — location: [5943](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5943) ^ref-17403

The Goals of Costume Design • Create characters with complex personal histories using the language of clothing. • Create a visually unified story world in collaboration with the director and other designers. • Express an artistic point of view appropriate to the project. • Enhance the story by eliciting emotional responses from the audience. • Balance both the creative and logistical demands for the specific project. — location: [5979](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=5979) ^ref-55441

“I truly believe everyone needs to know Illustrator or Photoshop. That is a prerequisite. I find that a young person coming into the business that doesn’t understand that—there is no excuse.” Isis Mussenden5 from a personal interview — location: [6540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=6540) ^ref-24309

Although Mussenden is comfortable with many aspects of digital work after working on Shrek and The Chronicles of Narnia, she points out that the costume design profession is in transition, with many established designers unable to use the required software. “They don’t have time to sit down to learn it. … Young people entering the profession can get jobs if they demonstrate those skills. Everyone needs a person to do all that.” Those interested in costume supervisor work have to be proficient in at least one costume management software program, such as CostumePro and CPlotPro. The latest innovation, SyncOnSet, is available as a free download to individuals, who can learn to use it on their own or take a number of workshops. — location: [6553](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=6553) ^ref-26729

Unraveling Costume Job Terminology • Costume Designers: create both the individual characters in a story and the overall picture of texture, color, and tone for the larger costume conceptual approach. In film, they function as one of the two Department Heads, with the Wardrobe Supervisor. In live theatre, the Costume Designer often also creates the makeup and hair styles, working with makeup and hair artists to complete those looks. • Assistant or Associate Costume Designers: work with the Lead Designer to complete a specified aspect of the design, as defined by each association. Some examples include assisting with sourcing, or taking charge of specific types of costumes such as a chorus, military uniforms, or menswear. • Stylists: use existing fashion garments and costume elements to create marketable images in the fashion print or on the runway, or to create a wardrobe for a specific person or special event. • Wardrobe Supervisors: work as the financial and operations part of a film team, responsible for daily operations, logistics, and personnel. In live theatre, a Wardrobe Supervisor may be another term used for a Costume Director, particularly for theatres who do not employ a full-time staff. Touring productions use a Wardrobe Supervisor to accompany the tour to oversee local or traveling crews and to maintain the costumes. • Costume Directors: usually employed by an institution as the Department Head. They have more extensive duties than a Costume Shop Manager, including strategic planning for multiple or large scale projects, some design duties, and budget forecasting and tracking. • Costumers: perform different functions depending on location or medium. In live theatre, a Costumer can be a general term for crew members working in the costume department. Themed Entertainment Costumers oversee the costumes in a particular attraction or live show. Film Costumers operate in several ways: handling garments in a rental warehouse; pulling character costumes under the direction of a Designer or Wardrobe Supervisor; preparing film costumes in a staging area; or operating on the set of a film or photo shoot to dress actors, and handle and maintain costumes in front of the camera. • Costume Illustrators: create renderings under the direction of a Costume Designer to communicate the finished look of a character. Union Illustrators are represented by the Costume Designers Guild. • Concept Artists: work as part of the pre-visualization process for a film, video game, or animation. Originally derived from the process of creating film storyboards or comic books, the position transitioned into use for complex fantasy projects requiring lengthy visual development, such as animation or themed entertainment. Concept Artists may define the general approach for branded assets (characters), such as superheroes, before a Costume Designer joins the team.

Costume designers are particularly interested in what kind of character will tell each part of the story most effectively: an animatronic character, live performers, pre-filmed video of live action performance, and the ride operators themselves. Every element must enhance the experience, with visitors piecing a story together as they move through the park or attraction. The designers conduct extensive artistic, cultural, and literary research on the given theme, even going so far as to visit far flung locales for inspiration, if possible. Cultural advisers consult with the theme park producer and design firms to prevent accidental offenses to the visitors, or to outline climate concerns in each location. — location: [6846](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=6846) ^ref-38157

The costume designer for themed entertainment begins their process in the same way as every costume designer: with their own research, creating mood boards for initial artistic communication, followed by several steps to create the final designs. But costume designers Weller and Sinclair note that they also have to be very proactive when they join the multi-year process already under way. Recognizing that the buildings themselves were designed years before the parade or show to fill it, they need to assess the overall costume protocol, and not just the design. Sinclair once discovered that a building created to store and stage a parade presented severe obstacles. The dressing rooms had been located on the top floor to use space efficiently, but once the performers dressed in their large dragon costumes, they could not fit down the staircase. Furthermore, the fully decorated and assembled floats could not fit through the exterior doors with all the elements in place. Every themed entertainment costumer must be comfortable with several formats, and be particularly skilled at communication so that they can collaborate with the unusually high number of parties involved in each decision. Themed entertainment costume designers categorize the characters they create in two ways: general characters, and specific branded characters such as Mickey Mouse, Shrek, or Harry Potter, whose appearance must meet strict guidelines. Consequently, many more levels of authority will have approvals over each design, such as company executives, agents and rights holders, and legal consultants. Ideas may be refused or amended for arcane reasons, but the costume designer must acquiesce. Each step adds many considerations and can create time delays when the clock is ticking towards opening day. — location: [6851](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=6851) ^ref-48070

Practical Considerations for Costumes Many characters in themed entertainment are anthropomorphic mixtures of human, fantasy, or animal forms, creating interesting challenges for the costumer and the performer. Designing and building these character costumes, sometimes referred to as “walk-arounds,” requires special artistry, knowledge of ergonomics, and health and safety considerations. These costumes should meld with human physiognomy, but will disguise—to one extent or another—how a person inhabits the interior. Even well-crafted character costumes can still be incredibly difficult to wear. In spite of hidden eye screens for the performer to see where they are going, visibility is often limited. Fans and cooling vests can be built into large costumes, but the outdoor work in most theme parks still creates a hot, sweaty environment. Performers in hot costumes will enter the park to interact in character for controlled times such as 15 to 30 minutes, and then leave through hidden paths for an extended break. The costumes themselves also endure rugged climate conditions such as sun-fading and rain, as well as special effects, such as bromine used in water shows as a purifier, that will fade materials or render them brittle. There are a number of hidden functional considerations that must be introduced into character costume design, such as whether a performer must dress or undress without help. The costume must break down in special sections for dressing, maintenance, and storage. Some large character costumes, for example, have removable hoops or padded under structures called “pods” so the storage area can accommodate many duplicates. “When we introduce new characters to the park we have to plan enough room to store that many large items,” notes Rivera,42 the Manager of Production-Entertainment Costuming for Universal Studios, Hollywood. Some of the very large character costumes she must consider include: Marge Simpson, whose body and hair towers well over 7 feet; the Despicable Me Minions who have short and very wide… — location: [6864](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=6864) ^ref-16928

One important feature of any theme park experience is Operations Costumes: the ensembles designed for employees in the park. Most visitors neglect to give this large part of their experience much thought, but employee appearance must also contribute to the story, work within a specific area or attraction, operate as the public face of the park, and serve as functional clothing. Managing operations costumes requires more than knowing what the costume should look like; the costume designer must be familiar with both garment manufacture techniques used in fashion and those used in theatrical costume design. Some examples of these skills include: understanding the role of prototypes; creating garments for affordable mass manufacture; predicting how size range grading may affect the design; negotiating manufacture with specific vendors who may require spec sheets, a prototype, or patterns; surface embellishment such as embroidery or printing and sublimation; and resourcing materials in large quantities. “In order to advance within the field, one needs to sharpen leadership abilities and financial expertise,” Weller45 recommends. — location: [6889](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=6889) ^ref-62734

Theme parks and stand-alone Halloween attractions are now packed with visitors lining up to see favorite attractions or new additions. The parks are subdivided into scare zones or mazes (a portable haunted house style experience), and some feature live shows. By 2014 Knott’s Scary Farm produced ten fully themed mazes featuring new content or reworking existing ideas aptly named Voodoo, The Gunslinger’s Grave, Black Magic, and Pinocchio Unstrung. Universal Studios began their own Halloween Horror Nights in 1991—a logical extension of their place in film history with monster and horror films such as the classic Frankenstein. Their 2014 season featured a maze based on the hit TV show The Walking Dead, and the 1981 film An American Werewolf in London. Combining puppetry, “scare-actors,” and three-dimensional video, it proved to be a crowd pleaser. The Walt Disney Company creates a family friendly Halloween, featuring their classic Haunted Mansion, as well as characters from Nightmare Before Christmas. These haunted themed attractions provide a large seasonal opportunity for actors, costumers, makeup artists, and puppeteers. The wardrobe departments begin work for Halloween during the summer, providing about three months to revamp returning attractions and to prepare new ones. The independent haunted attraction business itself expanded in the past 20 years with haunted houses or mazes growing in cities or regions without major theme parks. These haunted venues run the gamut from creating temporary pop-ups in parks and parking lots to sophisticated haunt companies such as Midnight Productions, featuring the 40,000 square foot attraction The 13th Gate, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Experiential entertainment now influences traditional theatrical performances through the innovative and wildly successful efforts of immersive theatre company Punchdrunk. The London-based company created Sleep No More, a site-specific version of Shakespeare’s Macbeth, first in London, and then in New York. Actors create scenes within the environment, and true to theme park format, the audience moves from space to space. Taking a cue from both themed entertainment and video games, the environment itself holds clues for the audience to examine. Punchdrunk’s latest show, The Drowned Man: A Hollywood Fable, took place in a building near Paddington Station in London. The company transformed the dreary offices into an eerie Hollywood studio of the 1960s, loosely adapting another classic script for the narrative, Buchner’s play Woyzeck. Both productions ask the audience to experience only some portions of the story, possibly returning several times to piece together the entire experience. — location: [6910](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWMAWJY&location=6910) ^ref-30714

Starting a career in themed entertainment requires, like any other profession, a network of contacts. Many theme parks will hire entry-level costumers as wardrobe issue and maintenance, checking costumes in and out to the various performers who work in the park. But Rivera42 stresses: “The chances are small you will be working in the theme park itself. That is not where most of the items are made anymore.” She notes that with a few exceptions, most costumes are created by sub-contractors, specialty shops, or the same made-to-order costume shops used in theatre or film. “That is where the jobs really are,” she reveals, because there are not enough craftspeople to work on the huge numbers of shows and characters that a theme park will use. Weller45 notes “Whether you strive to develop expertise with defined technical skills, or pursue skills for involvement in a broader role, it is an enthusiasm for what you do, a respectable work ethic, and an ability to collaborate well with others that will help make you a valuable contributor wherever your career adventures take you.” Mickey’s Ten Commandments   1. Know your audience: Don’t bore people, talk down to them, or lose them by assuming that they know what you know.   2. Wear your guest’s shoes: Insist that designers, staff, and your board members experience your facility as visitors as often as possible.   3. Organize the flow of people and ideas: Use good storytelling techniques, tell good stories not lectures, lay out your exhibit with a clear logic.   4. Create a weenie: Lead visitors from one area to another by creating visual magnets and giving visitors rewards for making the journey.   5. Communicate with visual literacy: Make good use of all the non-verbal ways of communication—color, shape, form, and texture.   6. Avoid overload: Resist the temptation to tell too much, to have too many objects; don’t force people to swallow more than they can digest; try to stimulate and provide guidance to those who want more.   7. Tell one story at a time: If you have a lot of information, divide it into distinct, logical, organized stories; people can absorb and retain information more clearly if the path to the next concept is clear and logical.   8. Avoid contradiction: Clear institutional identity helps give you the competitive edge; the public needs to know who you are and what differentiates you from other institutions they may have seen.   9. For every ounce of treatment, provide a ton of fun: How do you woo people from all other temptations? Give people plenty of opportunity to enjoy themselves by emphasizing ways that let people participate in the experience, and by making your environment rich and appealing to all senses. 10. Keep it up: Never underestimate the importance of cleanliness and routine maintenance; people expect to get a good show every time; people will comment more on broken and dirty stuff.
