## Highlights
responsibility. Rest assured that, regardless of what anyone might claim, this book is as free of “spin” as I can make it, recognizing that generalities about deaf children are extremely difficult to make—there is no “average” deaf child—and conclusions that seem obvious today might change tomorrow. — location: [111](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=111) ^ref-36625

Over the years, this has become actualized in my most frequent claim: deaf children are not hearing children who can’t hear. Yes, we can all be equal, but deaf children and hearing children know some different things, learn in some different ways, have some different social–emotional responses to things, and exist in somewhat different environments. That’s okay—as long as we recognize that fact. — location: [132](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=132) ^ref-52671

---
later, although young children with implants generally read better than deaf children without implants during the elementary school years—often as well as hearing children—for many of them, that advantage is reduced or completely gone by high school. — location: [176](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=176) ^ref-38131

---
It does not mean you should ignore the potential of a cochlear implant for your child by deciding against one. It does mean that you should not assume that an implant will make your child into a hearing child or that raising and educating a child with an implant is necessarily easier than raising one without an implant. It also means that we need to do a better job of understanding how best to teach deaf children with cochlear implants at different ages so as to build on their strengths and accommodate their needs. — location: [183](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=183) ^ref-18033

Second, there also is no evidence that bilingual–bicultural (Bi–Bi) education—teaching both sign language and written/spoken languages at the same time—benefits DHH children beyond the early school years. — location: [193](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=193) ^ref-47265

education. In the United States, I have found only one published study providing evidence in support of bilingual–bicultural education, and it involved elementary school students at a single private school. — location: [199](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=199) ^ref-46625

We usually do not continue early interventions for children who show good language skills, but the language, knowledge, and skills that a young signer brings to learning inside and outside of the classroom may not match what is needed in high school. — location: [204](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=204) ^ref-38780

---
By high school and college age, though, research has shown that use of spoken language does predict academic achievement. So, if a child has spoken language skills, it is important to ensure that whatever kind of program she is enrolled in supports those skills. — location: [209](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=209) ^ref-33305

At the outset, it is important to note that deaf education, and in some sense what it means to be a deaf person, is at a point of real change. — location: [277](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=277) ^ref-8761

---
ways. One of these changes, which began in the United States in the mid-1970s and in other countries more recently, is the push to inclusive education, that is, having DHH children and others with disabilities educated in regular classrooms with their hearing, nondisabled peers. — location: [279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=279) ^ref-55016

almost 90% of DHH children live at home and attend their local public schools for all or part of the school day. — location: [282](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=282) ^ref-12763

---
The shift to having most DHH children in regular schools means that their peer groups are different, the way—and perhaps the language—in which they are taught is different, and the expectations placed on them by their teachers are different. Though many older deaf people will argue that something important has been lost—namely, the friendships and “family” of the residential school dormitory—most research today shows that DHH children and adolescents want to use spoken language and attend regular schools. — location: [285](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=285) ^ref-40968

75% of deaf 15- to 27-year-olds reported wanting to use spoken language only. — location: [289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=289) ^ref-59517

hearing losses in earlier generations of deaf children most frequently were caused by diseases like rubella, meningitis, mumps, and measles. These illnesses, along with chronic ear infections, still can result in acquired hearing loss, but they are relatively rare in children today compared with previous generations. The most common causes of congenital and early-onset hearing loss in children today are genetic (hereditary) factors and premature birth. — location: [305](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=305) ^ref-44511

and about 1 in 4 babies born prematurely have significant hearing or vision loss. — location: [309](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=309) ^ref-38545

A dramatic but positive change in the lives of deaf people, and particularly deaf children, has been the rapid growth of cochlear implantation. — location: [312](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=312) ^ref-4985

---
only by recognizing and accepting the differences among DHH learners, as well as between them and their hearing peers, can we identify ways to educate them all appropriately and optimally. — location: [346](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=346) ^ref-56214

---
in a recent book, some deaf scholars raised questions about whether “Deaf ” is useful at all. They suggested that using the two terms creates an unhealthy split between “Deaf” and “deaf” people and oversimplifies views of a complex population that differs in a variety of ways. — location: [362](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=362) ^ref-16081

---
At least according to my recent research, more (young) DHH people now are seeing themselves as bicultural—feeling comfortable in both deaf and hearing worlds—rather than strongly linked to the Deaf community. Many of these individuals sign in some situations but speak in others. — location: [387](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=387) ^ref-6163

use. In this book, I do not use the word deaf to refer either to people who have lost some of their hearing as a normal part of growing older or to people who might have slight hearing losses, perhaps from ear infections as toddlers. Consistent with the primary focus of the book, but in contrast to earlier editions, I will apply it only to those children and adults with hearing losses that affect practical, day-to-day life at home, in school, or in public social situations (see Chapter 2). — location: [396](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=396) ^ref-61224

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an impairment is any loss of physical or psychological functioning considered normal for human beings, whereas a disability is any restriction or lack of ability to perform normally due to an impairment — location: [409](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=409) ^ref-48690

---
As far as I can tell, however, there is no evidence (other than personal stories) to indicate that being part of the Deaf community—or not—leads to any better outcomes. This may have been different decades ago, when DHH people had fewer social and career opportunities, but the possible reasons for that situation, the relevant evidence (or lack thereof), and its implications will require several more chapters to explain. — location: [424](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=424) ^ref-1905

---
we can use “signing” to refer to systems of communication that make primary use of the hands and face to communicate through visual-spatial means, although “sign system” is technically more correct for most of the signing that we see on a day-to-day basis. ASL, in contrast, refers to a specific natural language (that is, not an invented system like Signed English or Signing Exact English, described in Chapter 3) that is used in the United States and in English-speaking parts of Canada. — location: [434](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=434) ^ref-11893

---
the late discovery of a hearing loss can have significant, long-term effects in a variety of areas. Late diagnoses mean that for the first months of life, when most infants are hearing and beginning to learn the sounds of their parents’ language, DHH children are not. — location: [459](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=459) ^ref-64328

hearing mothers with deaf babies touch them more than do mothers with hearing infants. They also use more frequent and more exaggerated facial expressions with — location: [466](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=466) ^ref-51877

---
their deaf infants (baby talk on the face), and they bring more things into their babies’ lines of sight so that they can share experiences and play together. But our knowledge about this “compensation” for the lack of hearing in mother-child interactions comes from observing mothers who already know that their infants have hearing losses, and therefore recognize the need to do something more than talk to their babies. — location: [467](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=467) ^ref-1644

---
For those children whose hearing losses are severe enough to prevent their learning an oral (spoken) and aural (heard) language, sign language can provide a viable alternative method for communication. The dilemma for parents is deciding when hearing losses are that severe (see Chapter 2). — location: [482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=482) ^ref-26657

---
cochlear implants are helpful for children’s language comprehension in one-on-one settings but often is less helpful in noisy (normal) classroom settings or when there is no face-to-face contact: Most of the time, most people use both vision and hearing in understanding spoken language. — location: [498](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=498) ^ref-28960

---
to the extent that sign language is easier for a young DHH child to learn than spoken language, early signing skill and early spoken language skill may be equally good supporters and predictors of later spoken language abilities. This suggestion is based on indirect evidence, however, and the issue will have to await further investigation. — location: [502](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=502) ^ref-6288

---
Evidence 20 years ago indicated that deaf children who learned to sign at a young age tended to be better adjusted emotionally, to have higher academic achievement during the early school years, and to have better social relationships with parents and peers relative to deaf children raised in speech-only environments. It is unclear whether digital hearing aids and cochlear implants have changed the situation, but results from recent research are considerably more complex than this generalization suggests. — location: [508](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=508) ^ref-41116

---
by the time they reach kindergarten, DHH children of deaf parents often lag behind hearing peers in language and the foundations of literacy and mathematics. They often will be ahead of other DHH children who have hearing parents, but as I already noted, that advantage seems to evaporate by the time they get to high school. — location: [532](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=532) ^ref-9600

---
For DHH children of hearing parents, early experiences may not blend so readily into the background of family and community life. For them, communication issues can result in limited or atypical experiences the most common of which are related to parents being overprotective and having low expectations. These can lead to delays in children’s social, language, and perhaps their intellectual functioning compared with hearing children. But wait, there’s more! — location: [535](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=535) ^ref-37713

---
Delaying decisions about learning sign language or getting an implant can make matters more difficult for both children and their parents. The first years of life are when basic language skills develop, and the first 2 to 3 years are generally recognized as the most important for language learning. We know that there is a sensitive (or critical) period during the first 3½ years of a child’s life when the brain is most adaptable with regard to language and cognitive development. — location: [549](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=549) ^ref-20578

---
Early intervention programs often are assumed to be for DHH children, but they are just as important for the parents of young DHH children. — location: [621](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=621) ^ref-30348

children. Family-centered intervention emphasizes the strength of the family in making decisions and collaborating with relevant professionals, and it typically involves working with children and their parents in the home instead of, or in addition to, other settings. — location: [630](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=630) ^ref-32447

---
programs, family-centered programs are about much more than just language. Because they are able to take into account the specific needs of parents and siblings as well as the DHH child, such programs can have a more holistic view of family interactions. Language can be considered in the context of social-emotional development, cognitive development, and family cultural values, recognizing how all three affect one another and affect early experience. Most importantly, this sort of programming emphasizes that each family is different in its needs, priorities, and methods of dealing with having a child with special needs. For children who have multiple disabilities, family-centered intervention provides a means of integrating support for children’s diverse needs within the realistic constraints of the home environment. — location: [638](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=638) ^ref-65267

---
The vast majority of DHH children have hearing parents, and those parents usually are unprepared to deal with the emotional and practical issues related to having a DHH child. Whether due to denial or misunderstanding, many parents fail to follow-up after their child is identified by newborn hearing screening as possibly having a hearing loss. Resulting delays in DHH children’s access to language during the critical stages of development (the first 3 to 4 years) can have a variety of negative consequences in social, language, and academic areas. Newborn hearing screening (see Chapter 2) and early intervention can help to support DHH infants and their families, but neither they nor technologies such as cochlear implants make deaf children into hearing children. — location: [647](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=647) ^ref-57134

---
It generally is true that: DHH children often cannot hear how much noise they are making. Hearing aids and cochlear implants enable many DHH children to understand speech. Children with cochlear implants, on average, hear as well as hard-of-hearing children. Speechreading is very difficult, especially in English. DHH children tend to have more academic difficulty than hearing children, especially in learning to read and write. American Sign Language is a language in its own right and differs from English in grammar and vocabulary. Most DHH people hold regular jobs and are fully functioning members of society. — location: [674](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=674) ^ref-56376

York. Unless they happen to live near a school for the deaf or in a city with an active parent organization, DHH children and their parents are unlikely to interact with—much less really get to know—many other DHH children or DHH adults. This situation has implications not only for sign language interpreting and other services, but also for the availability of deaf role models and sign language teachers for DHH children and their parents. — location: [718](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=718) ^ref-51113

According to the National Institutes of Health, approximately 1 in 1,000 infants is born with a hearing loss greater than or equal to 70 dB (decibels, see discussion later in this chapter) in the better ear, and 2 to 3 out of every 1,000 newborns have some hearing loss. — location: [753](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=753) ^ref-19407

---
The situation is more serious in countries like Pakistan and India, where 80 to 110 children per 1,000 have significant hearing loss. Even worse, due to frequent ear infections (otitis media or glue ear in some countries) and difficulties in obtaining medical care, upwards of 40% of Aboriginal children in Australia have been reported to have hearing loss. This rate is apparently eclipsed only by Inuit children in the western Arctic, over 65% of whom were found to have hearing loss according to one study. — location: [761](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=761) ^ref-42939

The decibel (dB) is the common unit of measurement for the intensity of sounds, perceived as loudness. For example, the loudness of normal speech in an otherwise quiet room is about 60–65 dB. — location: [781](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=781) ^ref-44914

Traveling in a car at 55 miles per hour, with the windows rolled up, air conditioning and heat off, and no one talking produces background noise of about 80 dB. — location: [783](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=783) ^ref-50143

Humans normally can hear sounds in the range of 20 to 20,000 hertz (Hz). — location: [789](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=789) ^ref-56331

---
When it comes to human speech, hearing losses in the range of 500 Hz to 2000 Hz are those that are most troublesome, because these are the frequencies of the important features of spoken language. Vowels tend to have lower frequencies, while consonants tend to have higher frequencies. Vowels are also louder than consonants, but they are not as important for distinguishing one word from another; and hearing a word is not the same as being able to understand it. — location: [790](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=790) ^ref-34867

---
The severity of a hearing loss (or the hearing threshold) is usually described in decibels averaged across all frequencies. However, for any individual child, it is important to consider the frequencies of the loss as well as how much is lost, because both will determine the child’s ability to discriminate sounds (residual hearing). This caution is especially important with milder hearing losses, where frequency losses tend to vary the widest. The hearing losses most frequently seen in older adults, in contrast, tend to affect the ability to hear sounds at higher frequencies before affecting the lower frequencies. — location: [795](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=795) ^ref-18635

we now know that although only 25% of DHH children come from families with histories of hearing loss, about 80% of cases of childhood hearing loss have a genetic component. — location: [890](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=890) ^ref-12516

In the United States, approximately 40% of all DHH children are believed to have psychological, neurological, or physical conditions associated with their hearing losses. — location: [907](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=907) ^ref-64516

Observed differences that might be assumed to be due to hearing loss actually might be due to a child having other disabilities, whether or not they are related to hearing loss. — location: [909](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=909) ^ref-49143

Medical personnel may overlook the fact that without access to communication and language, DHH children with other problems cannot understand what is happening to them and what others want from them. Communication must be a high priority with such children, not something to take care of later. — location: [916](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=916) ^ref-12673

---
DHH children frequently have been misdiagnosed as having autism as well as intellectual disability because of communication barriers associated with hearing loss. It remains unclear whether autism is overdiagnosed or underdiagnosed in DHH children today, and the direction might vary by country and the presence of other disabilities. In the United States, ASD appears five times more likely in DHH than hearing children (5% vs. 1%). — location: [933](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=933) ^ref-12226

There are several different kinds of otoacoustic emission procedures. The more common ones use a sensitive microphone that can pick up both externally generated sounds and inner ear responses to them. Evoked otoacoustic emissions (EOAEs), for example, take advantage of the mechanical functioning of the cochlea. EAOE requires less than 1 minute per ear, and provides a full assessment and documentation of an infant’s potential for hearing in 3 minutes. Testing involves placing in the newborn’s ear a soft combination earphone/microphone that sends out “clicks” made up of several tone frequencies. When the vibrations reach the cochlea, the fluid and hair cells move, so there are slight changes in air pressure inside the ear canal resulting from both the original sound and its “echo.” The pattern and intensity of the echo provides information on the healthiness of the middle and inner ear and likelihood of hearing loss. — location: [955](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=955) ^ref-59067

---
Auditory brainstem responses (ABR) have been used for years as a test of responses to sound in the auditory nerve and brain, that is, beyond the cochlea. ABR involves rapidly sending thousands of tone bursts consisting of a broad range of frequencies and measuring the response of the brainstem using electrodes placed on the scalp. Because the tone bursts are very brief and the responses small, ABR is best used with a relaxed or sleeping baby. — location: [962](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=962) ^ref-44275

---
many babies who fail their initial screening—suggesting the possibility of a hearing loss—actually will have normal hearing. Some people, therefore, have argued that telling parents that their baby failed a hearing test might make them anxious, perhaps resulting in mothers becoming more aloof or hesitant in early interactions with their babies, and possibly disrupting the mother-infant bond (very important to later development, as we shall see in the next chapter). — location: [979](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=979) ^ref-24060

doctors and audiologists are the ones who most often claim that parents are upset by hearing screening. Parents themselves almost universally support it, and I do not know of a single study showing negative effects of screening or false positives on mothers, infants, or their relationships. — location: [987](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=987) ^ref-24580

---
the greater problem seems to be parents who do not return for follow-up testing after their infants have been identified as at-risk by screening. We saw earlier that 30% to 50% of U.S. parents do not bring their babies back for re-testing, depending on the community, hospital, and characteristics of parents involved. — location: [993](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=993) ^ref-14657

Even for people with profound hearing losses at the frequencies important for speech reception, amplification still can be useful. Whether or not they can understand speech, amplification might draw their attention to sound-related events like a car coming, someone entering the room, or someone speaking. — location: [1004](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=1004) ^ref-51202

I have colleagues who think that some of our DHH students do not use hearing aids simply because they do not realize how helpful they might be. Kids may not want to use hearing aids for other reasons. For younger children, who have more sensitive ears (and more sensitive taste buds, by the way) than older children and adults, they just may be uncomfortable. For older children, it’s a different story. In a school for the deaf I was visiting, a teacher told me that her students did not like wearing their hearing aids because they “weren’t sexy.” — location: [1043](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=1043) ^ref-27010

Although some people argue that such children should not be forced to wear hearing aids if they do not want to, others make a comparison with glasses. Would we really permit children not to wear their glasses in school if they didn’t want to wear them? — location: [1049](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=1049) ^ref-30762

For parents considering getting hearing aids for their children (or themselves, for that matter), I would advise a university audiology clinic, if at all possible, rather than a commercial outlet. — location: [1063](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=1063) ^ref-10318

Cochlear implants do not turn deaf children into hearing children, but they give deaf children greater awareness of what is happening around them, better access to information in the classroom, and more possibilities for the acquisition of spoken language than ever before. — location: [1073](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=1073) ^ref-24472

Recent research, however, suggests that children with cochlear implants learn somewhat differently than either deaf or hearing peers. For me, this is most apparent in findings indicating that deaf children with cochlear implants, on average, read better than deaf children without cochlear implants in elementary school, but this difference largely disappears by high school. — location: [1083](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=1083) ^ref-57019

As soon as the surgical incision has healed, from 2 to 4 weeks after surgery, it is time for the initial mapping of the implant, where it is “tuned” to the particular hearing profile of the child. Over a series of visits to the audiologist, the tuning will become more precise, matching the child’s hearing loss in terms of both loudness and frequencies. — location: [1109](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=1109) ^ref-29080

Language comprehension and production can continue to improve in children over several years after they receive their implants. This is different from late-deafened adults (like radio commentator Rush Limbaugh) who tend to have relatively rapid recovery of hearing functioning after implantation but reach an upper limit in their improvements more quickly. — location: [1119](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=1119) ^ref-60465

because of the way that the electrode wire is inserted and wound into the cochlea, remaining hair cells—and residual hearing—are sometimes lost. Implants always used to be inserted into the ear with less hearing for this reason, but many surgeons feel that with better surgical methods this is no longer an issue. Second, although implants sometimes have to be removed, reimplantation in the same ear is quite common. — location: [1123](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=1123) ^ref-45201

Implant surgery is now quite safe, and implantation around one year of age or even earlier is now common in the United States (and as early as 6–8 months in Australia). Bilateral implants (one in each ear) are becoming more popular.

As mentioned earlier, there is now international research showing that earlier use of sign language supports the acquisition of spoken language after cochlear implantation. At the same time, because the threshold for exposure to spoken language is likely to vary among children, it is difficult to know whether too much emphasis on signing could reduce much-needed exposure to speech.

children with implants generally do not have sufficient hearing and speech reception skills to be able to pick up on many of the subtleties of speech and social situations (warmth, sarcasm, etc.).

My best guess is that because deaf children with cochlear implants and/or deaf parents have such good language and reading skills in elementary school, they do not receive as much intervention programming as their deaf peers who are struggling. Indeed, in many U.S. states, support services for such children are withdrawn after they leave elementary school. Dr. Inho Chung (Japan) also has pointed out that the language and vocabulary used in elementary school are very similar to those used in the home, while the language and vocabulary in high school are not. — location: [1271](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=1271) ^ref-29682

In a study we conducted with deaf college students, we found that those who used cochlear implants were roughly evenly split between those who saw themselves as affiliated with Deaf communities or those who saw themselves as affiliated with hearing ones.

Taken together, then, the studies conducted thus far suggest that there do not appear to be any large, long-term effects of cochlear implants, either positive or negative, on deaf children’s social-emotional development, their interactions with hearing peers, or relations with their families.

(1) There is no single “correct” answer to the language question that can be applied to all or even most DHH children (remember, everything works for somebody, nothing works for everybody); (2) there can be places for both signed and spoken language in the lives of most DHH children (there doesn’t have to be, but there will be time for those decisions later); and (3) sign language can play a role in the early language development of DHH children, even those who later will rely on spoken language. — location: [1543](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=1543) ^ref-6906

Children exposed to both sign language and spoken/written language showed the best progress in learning to read and write. Although that description may still be true for children without cochlear implants, it is no longer certain.

Indeed, the most common argument against SimCom is the claim that it will not support DHH children becoming fluent in either ASL or English.

ASL and similar sign languages clearly are viable alternatives to spoken language and provide a foundation for learning, even if they do not contribute directly to literacy skills.

Following cochlear implantation, by about two years of age or so, most recipients have been found to acquire speech that is understandable by all listeners and following the same developmental path and with qualities nearing those of hearing children. No, it’s usually not perfect, but the difference between spoken language outcomes for young deaf children today and those even 10 years ago is nothing short of amazing. Meanwhile, their language development (distinct from their speech) outpaces that of other DHH children, including those with lesser hearing losses.9 — location: [1921](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=1921) ^ref-28012

There are several different approaches to enhancing spoken language by DHH children, however, and the apparent disagreements among their respective supporters are just as bewildering as those among advocates of various sign systems. So, let us consider the two primary approaches, at least in North America: the Auditory Verbal and the Auditory Oral methods. In the United Kingdom, Natural Oralism (or Natural Auralism) and the Maternal Reflective Method are also popular, the first emphasizing the link between language and cognitive development, and the second emphasizing the importance of writing (a return to “natural methods” popular in the 19th century). — location: [1999](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=1999) ^ref-62461

---
The auditory verbal method (AV or auditory verbal therapy, AVT) is best known for its focus on enhancing DHH children’s listening skills and limiting the use of speechreading. During therapy sessions, the therapist’s mouth is usually covered, so that children cannot make use of visual cues to comprehension. — location: [2005](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2005) ^ref-20455

---
The AV approach emphasizes integration at several levels. Most centrally, the focus on children’s use of spoken language in various social and family settings is aimed at having speech and hearing become a central part of the child’s personality. Hearing and speaking are supposed to become rewarding, so that the child is motivated to use their hearing and speech skills. — location: [2014](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2014) ^ref-30156

A key difference is that the AO method allows children to make use of speechreading as well as hearing to support both comprehension and production of spoken language. — location: [2020](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2020) ^ref-27635

Speechreading of some other languages, such as Italian and Spanish, is somewhat easier because of greater regularity in the way in which sounds are combined and their correspondence to letters in writing. — location: [2036](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2036) ^ref-57829

There is abundant evidence in the United States and elsewhere that Cued Speech can help DHH children to understand spoken language, although its impact on production is less clear.

Compared to hearing infants, DHH infants and their hearing mothers may simply begin their relationships interacting in somewhat different ways.

However, most deaf parents simply say they are far less concerned than hearing parents with the hearing status of their babies: deaf is fine, hearing is fine, too.

Hearing parents frequently report feeling rejected, guilty, or anxious about the apparent lack of a warm relationship with their baby.

---
there is frequently a complaint of too much or contradictory information. Changes in public awareness about hearing loss, newborn hearing screening programs, and more health-related programs for mothers and infants are making such complaints less common, but many people have mistaken ideas about hearing loss, sign language, cochlear implants, and deaf education. Even some professionals who should know better have biases about raising and educating deaf children, so that it still is not uncommon for parents to report that they were given biased or incomplete information about cochlear implants and sign language by the people conducting hearing screenings. — location: [2260](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2260) ^ref-10585

family.

Because mothers are the ones who typically take on most of the added responsibility, they are also the ones in greatest need of such outside support. In fact, social support of hearing mothers with DHH children has implications far beyond smoother family functioning. Mothers who have such support during the early months tend to have greater sensitivity to their infants’ needs and moods (referred to as maternal sensitivity in the literature), something that we now know is an important predictor of better language development as well as social functioning. — location: [2305](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2305) ^ref-13000

DHH children can grow up to be just as emotionally well adjusted as hearing children, but they need the same kind of parenting and the same kinds of experiences as hearing children.

it is sometimes claimed that DHH children generally are likely to be less securely attached to their hearing mothers, as compared with hearing children of hearing parents or deaf children of deaf parents.

mothers who have good communication with their DHH children have more stable and warm relationships with them, regardless of whether they themselves are hearing or deaf and regardless of the mode of communication they use (speech, sign, or both). More effective communication between mothers and their DHH children also leads to better mental health outcomes, and neither spoken language nor sign language appears to have any advantage in that regard. — location: [2347](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2347) ^ref-36873

development. In situations where parents do not have the knowledge and communication skills to deal with their children’s behavior, they are more likely to have to depend on direct, physical means. For example, hearing parents of DHH children are more likely than hearing parents with hearing children or deaf parents with either deaf or hearing children to gain a child’s attention by moving her head in the intended direction and are more likely to use physical punishment. — location: [2354](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2354) ^ref-8671

---
example, overprotective behaviors on the part of mothers are likely to affect their DHH children’s interactions with peers and other adults because they lead the children to “expect” those kinds of behaviors from others. Similarly, parents and teachers who are constantly “rescuing” DHH children from awkward situations will prevent them from developing their own strategies for solving problems. Having lower expectations for DHH children’s behavior is likely to result in them having lower expectations for themselves. At the same time, we have to recognize that some maternal behaviors can appear overbearing but might be necessary in order to ensure children’s safety, cooperation, or obedience. What appears to be intrusiveness simply may be part of getting a child’s attention, and what looks like directiveness might reflect attempts to overcome communication barriers rather than any desire to control a child’s behavior. — location: [2378](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2378) ^ref-64543

Adjusting to having a DHH child is not an easy experience for many hearing parents.

When it comes to early vocalizations such as crying, fussing, grunting, and cooing, DHH babies really do sound much the same as hearing babies of hearing parents.

Young DHH children of both deaf and hearing parents, for example, produce individual and repeated sign components without any apparent attempt at communication. Since publication of the first edition of this book, this form of manual babbling has been documented in both DHH and hearing children, and since the second edition in deaf children with cochlear implants. So, manual babbling appears to be a more general phenomenon than was once believed and not anything specific to DHH children, whether or not they are acquiring sign language as their first language (as researchers used to think). — location: [2577](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2577) ^ref-54564

Among those DHH infants who are learning sign language as a first language, there is a relatively small set of about a half dozen hand configurations that frequently are seen early on. These handshapes comprise the primary stuff of later signs and, like the basic vowel and consonant sounds in spoken language, are general enough to be found across all documented sign languages. Just as importantly, this manual babbling provides a motivation for deaf or signing-hearing parents to engage in “conversations” with their DHH infants in the same way that babbling prompts hearing parents to talk to their hearing infants. — location: [2582](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2582) ^ref-38284

Among young DHH children of deaf parents, for example, there apparently is a noticeable change in the use of pointing from an “immature” gesture showing or requesting something to a “mature” form in the personal pronouns of ASL like ME, HER, and YOU.1 — location: [2607](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2607) ^ref-53360

At around 9 months of age, both DHH and hearing children use pointing as a showing or requesting gesture. Then, at around 12 months of age, deaf children of deaf parents (and others with sign language as their first language) apparently stop using pointing to refer to people, although it still can refer to things and places. Some 6 to 12 months later, person-pointing comes back into use; but this time, those motions are used within sign as personal pronouns. Such shifts indicate that gestures and signs are distinct, even if they look the same. — location: [2609](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2609) ^ref-2875

Between 9 and 12 months of age, hearing children make some sounds that are similar to adult words.

Like the “first words,” “first signs” tend to be rather simple approximations that, at least initially, could be entirely unintended by the child. The sign MILK is a good example, here. Is it because milk is so important for infants (from whose point of view?) that MILK is most frequently reported as children’s first sign? Or is it because the sign is so simple, being made by the simple opening and closing of a 5-hand? — location: [2648](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2648) ^ref-19736

Examples such as these suggest some caution is due in claiming that deaf babies “mean to say something” with their very early signs (referred to as the early sign advantage). Still, the social consequences of some of those early babbles, proto-signs, and signs are exactly the same as those resulting from some of hearing children’s first babbles, proto-words, and words. — location: [2661](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2661) ^ref-22286

three distinct stages. In the first, the slow word learning stage (up to 12–14 months), a word (or sign) will have to be repeated numerous times before it appears to be linked to its referent (person, object, or event), understood by a child, and used spontaneously. In the second, fast word learning stage, words can be learned after a child has encountered them only once or twice (in appropriate contexts). Finally, at about 18 months of age, vocabulary learning undergoes another, more dramatic change. With the beginning of fast mapping or cognitively mediated word learning, children can make use of what they already know (both language and things) to figure out the meanings of new words at an amazing rate. — location: [2692](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2692) ^ref-42915

very few DHH children of deaf parents show vocabulary spurts. At age three, they may have vocabularies in the range typically seen in hearing children, but if so, they appear to arrive there through a more gradual increase in their sign vocabularies, without any indication of fast mapping. This does not mean that fast mapping doesn’t happen. Fast mapping has been found in DHH children (mostly with hearing parents), but it tends to appear up to three years later than in hearing children. — location: [2702](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2702) ^ref-3200

Hearing children of hearing parents who are not teachers generally use about 55 different words when they are 16 months of age, over 225 words at 24 months, and about 10 phrases also around 20 months.

Those averages, however, also appear roughly to hold for the sign vocabularies of DHH children with deaf parents learning a sign language as a first language.

There really are not very many “transparent” signs, and how obvious the meaning of a sign is has no effect on how likely it is to be learned by young children.

some deaf adults do not use spoken language despite having excellent speech skills, simply because of the way that spoken language training was forced upon them as children.

early expressive language—either signed or spoken—is what is important, and how much early language a child has is a good predictor of future spoken language ability. In particular, greater expressiveness in either sign language or spoken language prior to cochlear implantation both predicts and supports later spoken language skills. Early success in communication also may enhance the desire of young DHH children to acquire social language skills. What seems to be neglected in most pro-speech arguments is the importance of early linguistic stimulation of children, in any mode. — location: [2868](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2868) ^ref-52536

During her early childhood, when her parents kept records of her language progress, the girl acquired signs and words at about the same rate. In this natural setting, well over three-quarters of all of the signs and words she used occurred in only one of her two languages. That is, she had either a sign or word for a concept, but not both. Only about 15% of the concepts in her vocabulary were expressed in both signs and words (although not necessarily at the same time). Beyond this common tendency to have a label for a thing in only one language at a time, somewhat older children tend to use only one mode of communication at a time, — location: [2885](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2885) ^ref-56417

---
Finally, for children who are initially exposed only to spoken language, later learning of sign language does not affect how often they use their voices, and parents’ concerns that sign language will replace early speech are unfounded. Rather, speech and sign skills may become increasingly intertwined in those children, improving both speech production and comprehension. — location: [2896](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2896) ^ref-21725

some observers of DHH children’s early language learning have claimed that the children’s signing tends to be more concrete and more tied to the “here and now” than the speech of hearing age-mates. — location: [2907](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2907) ^ref-58296

---
DHH children who do not have a mode of effective communication with their hearing parents generally have a greater percentage of words that refer to people, places, and things (nouns) than either hearing children of hearing parents or DHH children of deaf parents. At the same time, their vocabularies have fewer signs or words that allow them to refer to more abstract concepts like time or the existence of things. A major contributor to this difference is undoubtedly that their parents differ in what they talk about. Parents who have difficulties communicating with their DHH children will be likely to focus on the “here and now,” things of immediate importance, most of which tend to be people, places, and things. When communication is more natural—whether spoken or signed—parents and children can go beyond the basics. — location: [2910](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2910) ^ref-14734

---
parents and teachers of DHH children often do not realize that they may be saying far more in their speech than in their signing. The problem is not necessarily that the signs cannot express the same information, it is just that greater fluency in speaking seems to overpower one’s signing ability. It is, therefore, not at all unusual to see people who think that they are using simultaneous communication actually omitting signs for up to half of their words. — location: [2933](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2933) ^ref-33625

During the second half of their fourth year, when signing DHH 3-year-olds begin to modify verb signs, they tend to use them first to communicate directions and locations. — location: [2962](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2962) ^ref-31325

---
DHH 3- and 4-year-olds also use some signs incorrectly in what are called overgeneralizations. Hearing children of this age frequently overgeneralize irregular verbs and nouns that they previously used correctly. So, fell becomes falled, presumably because they have learned a general rule (for the past tense in this example) and attempt to make all similar words fit that rule. Signing DHH children similarly are seen to overgeneralize, for example, by adding direction to nondirectional verbs such as TOUCH or DRINK, — location: [2968](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2968) ^ref-59337

Whatever their reaction, parents and teachers should recognize the importance of such “errors.” They indicate that the child is making sophisticated guesses about the grammar of the language and acquiring its component rules. — location: [2974](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2974) ^ref-45751

is not the hearing status of the mother that matters but whether mother and child share the same mode of communication. In signing, deaf mother-child pairs (dyads), mothers are more likely to pick up on visual cues, and their DHH children are more likely to produce them. In speaking mother-child pairs with hearing mothers, mothers are more sensitive to vocal cues from their DHH children. Hearing mothers with signing DHH children also develop sensitivity to their children’s visual cues as their own visual communication improves; it just may not come as naturally or easily as it does to mothers who have lifetimes of practice in visual communication. — location: [2991](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=2991) ^ref-59375

hearing mothers often tend to oversimplify and use language that carries far less information than the language they use with hearing children in similar situations.

be careful about accepting information from older references or from parents who have older DHH children.

In the United States, early intervention services for DHH children aged 0 to 3 years fall under IDEA, Part C. On their third birthdays, they transition to preschool services, which fall under IDEA, Part B. Those programs may be run by public or private schools, including schools for the deaf, and other state or private agencies. In providing services for parents as well as children, such programs focus on language development, parent-child communication, social skills, and appropriate support, through testing and possible fitting for hearing aids, for any residual hearing children might have. Early interventionists and preschool teachers generally provide parents with strategies for enhancing their children’s development, including instruction in supporting spoken language, sign language, or both, depending on the particular program and children’s needs. — location: [3229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3229) ^ref-20324

---
Although it is difficult to unravel the many factors that contribute to the preschool experience for DHH children, there is no doubt that early exposure to effective spoken language or sign language by specialized interventionists supports DHH children’s social interactions with peers as well as with their parents. Studies involving older DHH children with and without preschool experience to determine how much exposure to one language or the other might be needed for fluency still lie ahead. Nevertheless, the availability of more diverse social, language, and educational experiences can only improve the flexibility of young DHH children in dealing with later social interactions involving hearing as well as DHH peers. We also would expect that such programs would have beneficial long-term effects on academic achievement, although reports thus far have tended to be anecdotal and testimonial, rather than supported by data. — location: [3240](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3240) ^ref-51387

It frequently is assumed that schools for the deaf today have greater numbers of DHH students with multiple disabilities and fewer numbers of DHH students using cochlear implants.

DHH children generally have better academic outcomes in mainstream rather than separate programs.

DHH adults also can serve as models for the development of appropriate social behavior, gender roles, and moral reasoning in DHH children.

mainstreaming typically involves attendance of some special classes (taught by a teacher of the deaf) and some regular classes, whereas inclusion entails students being “fully included” in all aspects of the public school setting.

In the programs that use sign language, the hearing students usually learn to sign, either through instruction or just through social interactions. — location: [3380](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3380) ^ref-24731

supporters, research conducted in countries like Sweden, Denmark, and Norway—where it all began—has indicated that DHH students educated in bilingual–bicultural settings, on average, do not have any better academic outcomes or go any further in school than those educated in mainstream settings. — location: [3384](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3384) ^ref-46889

---
Research into outcomes from co-enrollment programs is more recent but has been somewhat broader, looking into language and social-emotional functioning as well as academic outcomes. With regard to language, consistent findings from several countries indicate that DHH students’ skills in the two languages of instruction are strongly linked, so that they move forward together. Whether those skills are comparable to those of hearing peers over the longer term is still unclear. — location: [3390](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3390) ^ref-60643

During the 1980s, DHH students and others with disabilities frequently were found to have left school only to end up unemployed or underemployed and participating minimally if at all in society. Something needed to be done, and the “transition movement” was born. — location: [3406](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3406) ^ref-45424

Postsecondary transition planning begins when a student is about 14 years of age and is integrated with the student’s annual IEP. The transition team typically consists of the student, family members, appropriate special and/or general education teachers, a counselor, a representative from a postsecondary education institution (if desired), relevant agency staff, and someone who can advise with regard to communication (e.g., sign language interpreter, audiologist). The Individualized Transition Plan (ITP) considers current levels of performance as well as the student’s goals in order to appropriately match skills and desired postsecondary activities — location: [3408](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3408) ^ref-31454

Most 2- and 4-year postsecondary programs in the United States have identified themselves as serving at least one DHH student, and the response among larger colleges and universities is almost 100%. Hundreds of colleges and universities provide special programs and services for DHH students. Included in this number are the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID), a college of Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), and Gallaudet University, which deserve special mention. — location: [3431](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3431) ^ref-27389

In a unique, fully mainstreamed setting, over 1,400 DHH students at RIT are able to earn degrees in any program offered by the university, such as engineering, computer science, applied art, and photography. Courses in the college of NTID, which includes just over half of the DHH students, are taught by faculty who sign for themselves, using ASL, English-based signing, or simultaneous communication, depending on the communication preferences and needs of their students. Courses taught in other colleges of the university are supported by sign language interpreters, real-time text captionists, and note takers whenever there are DHH students in a class. — location: [3436](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3436) ^ref-29873

Surprisingly, perhaps, DHH students with moderate-to-profound hearing losses often have higher academic achievement than students with mild losses. — location: [3448](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3448) ^ref-41710

---
During the school years, students with greater hearing losses may receive more support services over a longer period of time. Even when such services are requested, hard-of-hearing and even some deaf students may not be able get them if they are judged not “disabled enough” by school administrators who may want to avoid costly support for only one or two students. — location: [3452](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3452) ^ref-20761

Further, the diverse language fluencies and cognitive abilities of DHH children, especially in the earlier grades, mean that an educational interpreter has to know much more than just sign language. — location: [3501](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3501) ^ref-28786

DHH students have to rely (more or less) on vision for effective communication in the classroom. When hearing students look down to write in their notebooks, they are able to continue to follow the lecture or classroom conversation because they can hear it. I have taught some hearing students who spend almost all of the class looking down and taking notes, but still following what was going on. DHH students do not have that luxury. Each time they look down to write something, they miss part of what is being said. — location: [3518](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3518) ^ref-23727

Schools and postsecondary programs that offer real-time text in the classroom can make those transcripts available to students. This is especially helpful for DHH students with secondary disabilities. — location: [3525](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3525) ^ref-50669

Despite common assumptions, there is little evidence that sign language interpreting leads to better learning than real-time text for students who sign, although many students report liking it better. — location: [3536](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3536) ^ref-20622

---
Real-time text also is likely to create challenges for some DHH students, especially younger ones, because the speed of real-time text often exceeds their reading abilities. DHH students also are more likely than hearing students to have vision problems, creating another challenge unless large text is used. — location: [3539](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3539) ^ref-61320

that using real-time text materials and visual displays (slides, computer screens) simultaneously in the classroom could actually hinder DHH students’ access to information, because they cannot be looking at two sources of visual information at the same time. — location: [3542](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3542) ^ref-50134

a truly fair comparison of various types of programs would need to include students who are comparable in terms of hearing losses, communication skills, academic backgrounds, family support, and so on. This kind of control happens in laboratory research, but it is not likely to occur naturally in the real world. It is therefore difficult to determine the extent to which observed differences between programs are due to something about the programs themselves or the possibility that they attract different kinds of students in the first place. — location: [3582](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3582) ^ref-24523

many of the large-scale studies conducted during the 1980s and 1990s were based on data from an annual survey that was heavily weighted toward DHH students with greater hearing losses enrolled in schools for the deaf. When there were fewer DHH students in mainstream programs, perhaps only one or two in the whole school, programs apparently were unwilling to take the time to complete the survey. There have been questions for a long time about how representative the results were for DHH learners, and the survey recently was discontinued. — location: [3595](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3595) ^ref-22194

that DHH children were roughly 1.3 years behind grade level in reading and 1.0 year behind in mathematics during the elementary and middle school years. These scores also indicate that parents should be very cautious about taking grades of A’s and B’s to indicate that their DHH child is doing well in school. — location: [3613](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3613) ^ref-22630

SEELS does not separate performance for subgroups of DHH students, according to their primary mode of communication, use of cochlear implants, or parental hearing status, three factors that are expected to influence performance. — location: [3619](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3619) ^ref-51323

---
The fact that NLTS2 did not find cochlear implant use or parents’ hearing status related to DHH high school students’ academic achievement contrasts with the results of studies involving DHH students in elementary school. — location: [3639](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3639) ^ref-52562

---
several explanations for such findings have been offered. These include the suggestion that because these two groups of children demonstrate the best language skills, they may receive less attention from teachers in school, and intervention services may end earlier than for DHH peers who struggle more with language. Alternatively, or perhaps in addition, the more abstract and complex materials studied at the high school level will require language, knowledge, and skills that young DHH students with deaf parents or cochlear implants may be less likely to get at home. High school also requires higher-level cognitive skills to a greater extent than is necessary in the younger grades. — location: [3641](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3641) ^ref-41364

DHH students generally have social confidence comparable to that of their hearing peers, although they are likelier to have more frequent social and psychosocial difficulties. The possible mismatch between DHH students’ social confidence and their actual social performance may be related to cognitive issues discussed in Chapter 8 relating to the ability to appreciate social situations from the point of view of others. — location: [3654](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3654) ^ref-38215

---
today, DHH children also do not report differences in their quality of life if they use spoken language rather than sign language, something that often is strongly linked to the kind of school they attend. At the very least, older findings indicating that DHH children were more content with their hearing losses, happier, and more social in schools for the deaf than in regular schools clearly are no longer true either in the United States or in European countries, — location: [3666](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3666) ^ref-54056

DHH children are better adjusted socially compared with peers in most other disability categories, with most scoring between “medium” and “high” in social skills exhibited inside and outside of school. They also are more positively adjusted socially than most of those in the other disability categories, were reported to be the most persistent in keeping on task, and are one of the highest groups in terms of self-advocacy. — location: [3670](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3670) ^ref-31828

---
schoolchildren who use cochlear implants are no more or less socially content than those who do not. During the early days of cochlear implantation, many people (myself included) were concerned that deaf children with implants might find themselves stuck between deaf and hearing worlds and a member of neither. As it has turned out, many young implant users feel bicultural, part of both deaf and hearing worlds, and for many more it simply is not an issue. — location: [3674](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3674) ^ref-26478

---
caution: Among older DHH students and young adults for whom the language demands are greater and the contexts of language and social interaction are more abstract and complex, life is a bit more complicated. Those who have better sign language or good spoken language skills following cochlear implantation tend to get along socially about as well as their hearing peers (see Chapter 9). — location: [3682](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3682) ^ref-23680

---
Early intervention (parent-infant and preschool) programs are available across most of the United States and in other countries. Normally funded by local school districts or schools for the deaf, these programs support the legal requirement of early testing and intervention for children who have significant hearing loss or other impediments to full educational access. Such programs provide communication instruction for both parents and DHH children while usually providing tutoring for parents in the special needs of their children. — location: [3698](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3698) ^ref-31623

Children who attend such programs tend to have both language and social advantages when they enter school, and there is broad agreement on the importance of those programs.

ability: The individual who is functionally literate has the minimum reading and writing skills necessary to function in society.

and a number of investigators, teachers, and observers have argued that bilingual education for DHH children offers the best opportunities for print literacy.2 For my own part, even if I think that having both sign language and spoken language skills will be to the advantage of many DHH learners, the reality (as I also wrote 10 years ago) is that we do not yet have evidence that bilingual education offers a path to print literacy for most DHH children, even if it feels as though it should. — location: [3796](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3796) ^ref-60359

It remains unclear how much learning language naturally, as opposed to its having to be taught, leads to different levels of reading ability, separate from already having more or less language while learning to read.

To understand text, I also need the rules of discourse structure.

one of the beautiful, if still somewhat mysterious, aspects of both first- and second-language learning: As long as it happens early, before age four or so for first languages and through adolescence for second languages, it seems to occur with relative ease—even if it takes several years. In contrast, many adults who — location: [3909](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3909) ^ref-51676

---
try to learn other languages find that understanding of the rules does not come as easily the second time around. Luckily, we are able to use what we know about our first language to help learn the second language, and, therefore, languages more similar to our first language usually are easier to learn. Imagine, then, what it would be like if you did not really understand the rules of the first language when you tried to learn a second, if the letters and words on the page did not correspond to what people “said,” and if you did not see the correspondence of words and events. That is the situation of many DHH children trying to learn to read. — location: [3911](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3911) ^ref-45238

Considerable resources and effort aimed at improving DHH children’s literacy have gone into trying to teach them the skills and strategies that work for hearing children, but deaf children are not hearing children who can’t hear.

several studies have shown young DHH children of deaf parents to be better readers than DHH children of hearing parents. That finding seems to make sense because those children usually are exposed to a sign language from birth and thus are more likely to have fluent first language than DHH peers with hearing parents. But, fluency in a sign language like ASL does not provide a DHH (or hearing) child with either the decoding or language comprehension skills needed for reading English. — location: [3935](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3935) ^ref-40433

and that is where sign-oriented intervention and preschool programs come in. This is relevant here because for DHH children who sign, those whose hearing mothers sign better are better readers. — location: [3956](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=3956) ^ref-31431

That finding suggests that DHH children learning to read English should have greater difficulty than DHH children learning to read Italian or Spanish, and that teaching phonological skills to young DHH readers may be more important in English- than Spanish-speaking countries.

the Visual Phonics system includes handshapes and related movements that represent the 46 sounds of spoken English.

Therefore, I frequently urge teachers of DHH schoolchildren to move away from the practice of focusing primarily on practical and familiar concepts.

many of the vocabulary instruction practices used with both DHH and hearing students are not supported by current research, because they yield only partial knowledge of words, primarily relating to how they are said or signed and their most common meanings, with little attention to additional meanings of a word, relations to other words, or possible figurative usages. Perhaps as a result, DHH students have been shown to have slower access to word meanings than their hearing peers as well as smaller vocabularies, likely contributing to their continuing reading difficulties. — location: [4024](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4024) ^ref-22630

DHH children’s vocabulary skills typically are better when words have only a single meaning or when they are presented in context rather than in isolation (as on many achievement tests).

for college students who use cochlear implants, simultaneous communication can lead to better learning than speech alone when the material is presented in a noisy classroom or when it is difficult or unfamiliar. The fact that the addition of signs was not helpful when material was simpler (in vocabulary and grammar) suggests that the signs might have increased the speed or likelihood of decoding, comprehension, or both. — location: [4035](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4035) ^ref-59629

students, DHH students generally are far more variable in their grammatical skills, having particular difficulty with constructions that depend on keeping track of meaning across multiple events and units in texts. Pronouns (he, her, their, that, it, etc.), for example, can cause difficulty because the reader has to remember the activities or characteristics of nouns in order to understand later who or what is being referred to in the sentence. — location: [4040](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4040) ^ref-40753

shared reading not only provides DHH children with information about printed text, but also fosters metacognitive (knowledge of and about thinking) and metalinguistic (knowledge about language use) skills. — location: [4054](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4054) ^ref-4846

DHH students, in particular, appear to be relatively poor at assessing their reading comprehension and often consider themselves to be good readers even when they do not really know what it means to be a good reader (the unskilled and unaware effect discussed in the next chapter). — location: [4059](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4059) ^ref-12936

Parents may unintentionally encourage dependent strategies in young DHH readers by underestimating their reading abilities and being overly helpful rather than, for example, encouraging children to use dictionaries or otherwise try to figure out the meanings of words themselves. — location: [4065](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4065) ^ref-22655

Teachers and parents also often devote so much time to correcting errors and attempting to teach the fundamental skills underlying reading that they may overlook emphasizing the goals and potential fun of reading. — location: [4067](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4067) ^ref-44070

---
By not reading and not having the desire to read more, DHH children may fail to develop the literacy-related metacognitive skills easily acquired by many of their hearing peers. Those skills can be explicitly taught, but their durability is likely to be far less than if they were naturally acquired by children through their own reading. — location: [4070](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4070) ^ref-58330

while the spelling abilities of elementary-school cochlear implant users approach the level of their hearing peers, they still make the kinds of misspelling and letter omission errors seen in DHH children without cochlear implants, suggesting that they depend on phonology for spelling less than do their hearing age-mates. — location: [4076](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4076) ^ref-8460

---
By college-age, even DHH students who received their implants at 3 years of age or younger, on average, do not differ from DHH peers without cochlear implants in vocabulary size. Similar findings have been obtained for several categories of their world knowledge, such as famous people or the ordering of events in history, areas in which hearing peers knew significantly more. — location: [4081](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4081) ^ref-35565

cochlear implant use is no longer associated with better reading ability more generally when DHH students reach high school and college. — location: [4085](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4085) ^ref-65500

---
DHH children who sign, in contrast, sometimes will invent spellings that include handshapes of the signs but may bear little resemblance to correct spelling; for example, “casl” for MUSCLE, which is made with a C-hand on the bicep or a mixing of phonological errors and intrusions, — location: [4094](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4094) ^ref-28563

In general, DHH children with higher reading levels make more sound-related errors in spelling, indicating that they are sensitive to the phonological aspect of spelling, even if they do not have (or can retrieve) the correct letter sequences. — location: [4098](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4098) ^ref-38036

DHH children who use hearing aids often are seen to spell better than peers with cochlear implants. This could reflect the parallel finding described earlier of children with cochlear implants no longer demonstrating advantages in reading after the elementary school years. It may be that children with moderate hearing losses and hearing aids struggle more in reading and writing than other DHH children with better language skills and thus receive more writing support from parents and teachers. — location: [4100](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4100) ^ref-23435

analyses of DHH students’ writing has demonstrated that DHH students’ writing can be rich and creative, even if it suffers in ways that many English teachers might find unacceptable. Some of my own work similarly has shown that English errors aside, DHH students’ writing as early as elementary school is both creative and conceptually well structured. At the level where events and actions in a story are laid out and organized, their writing is at the same level as that of hearing peers. It’s just not very good English. — location: [4113](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4113) ^ref-12990

even if DHH children are not fluent in English spelling and grammar, they still can demonstrate creativity and competence in some aspects of writing. Such successes can be used as motivation for more and better writing. — location: [4138](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4138) ^ref-33073

Studies conducted by English teachers of older DHH students have found many of them to enjoy writing, keeping journals, reporting on events of interest, and writing creatively. — location: [4146](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4146) ^ref-20973

addition, DHH students often appear to have relatively narrow views of English and other academic subjects. So, they may not recognize the extent to which English and math skills will be helpful in their careers or that skills learned in one course will be used in others. — location: [4154](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4154) ^ref-55362

It is not uncommon for people to believe that individuals who are deaf can see better than people who can hear, what is referred to as the sensory compensation hypothesis. This suggestion is not true in any simple sense, because DHH children are two to three times more likely than hearing children to have vision problems. And, I mentioned in an earlier chapter that in visual-spatial tasks, DHH individuals usually perform no better, and sometimes worse, than hearing peers. — location: [4366](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4366) ^ref-19849

some tasks that seem to require only visual-spatial abilities (like tapping blocks in a demonstrated sequence) are strongly related to DHH students’ language skills, regardless of whether they rely primarily on sign language or spoken language. So, among DHH individuals who depend primarily on sign language, those with better sign language skills do better on these visual-spatial tasks than individuals with lesser sign language skills. But on the same tasks, among those DHH individuals who depend primarily on spoken language, those with better — location: [4394](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4394) ^ref-30347

that the studies showing deaf individuals to score better than hearing individuals on visual-spatial tasks tested adult native signers, deaf individuals who acquired a sign language as their first language and were fluent in it. The individuals in our studies were all college students, most of whom had hearing parents and learned to sign anywhere from birth to college age. Apparently, no one before us had given the same visual-spatial tasks to DHH users of spoken language rather than sign language. As a result, no one ever recognized that it was the level of someone’s language ability rather than the use of sign language which made for better performance in visual-spatial tasks. — location: [4401](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4401) ^ref-50794

most visual-spatial tasks require more than visual + spatial abilities; in fact, they also depend on reasoning or problem-solving skills that often involve the internal language mentioned earlier. — location: [4406](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4406) ^ref-31601

DHH children vary more in their cognitive and academic performance than hearing children, influenced by whether they use speech versus sign, differences in their concept knowledge, and their awareness of when and how to use various learning and memory strategies. — location: [4413](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4413) ^ref-43506

learners. Just as important as what is explicitly taught to children is the wealth of knowledge they obtain incidentally, either by overhearing (or “overseeing”) the conversations of others or via informal interactions with adults and other children. Such implicit learning usually will be more frequent in hearing than DHH children because there will be more “teachers” around who share a common language. One encouraging sign in this regard has been the finding that when deaf children receive cochlear implants, the rate at which they acquire new vocabulary increases rapidly, often matching that of hearing peers. — location: [4469](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4469) ^ref-16351

Deaf students who receive cochlear implants earlier (before 3 years of age in our case) or later have been found to have no bigger vocabularies than DHH peers without implants, and all three groups have significantly smaller vocabularies than hearing peers. — location: [4478](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4478) ^ref-41265

Even when parents or teachers share a (signed or spoken) language with DHH children, they usually only think to ensure communication when addressing children directly. — location: [4480](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4480) ^ref-28773

Among hearing children, the best predictor of vocabulary size at 3 years of age is the amount of informal language the child hears at home, not the amount that is taught in school. — location: [4483](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4483) ^ref-19016

Hearing children, for example, “exercise” their memories with frequently repeated songs, nursery rhymes, and storybooks (the same ones read over and over and over). There is no reason why those same activities cannot be used with young DHH children, spoken, signed, or both. Memory also is involved in daily routines and activities, and DHH children can be reminded if they forget. The worst thing to do would be to lower expectations or forgive forgetting because a child has a hearing loss. — location: [4518](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4518) ^ref-50637

during hearing children’s reading, problem solving, or academic tasks, individual words, items, or actions are more likely to connect, or connect faster, to related memories. This automatic, spreading activation in long-term memory is particularly important for ongoing language comprehension. — location: [4527](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4527) ^ref-44358

it. This is something I have seen quite often in teaching and conducting research with DHH college students. Having experienced relatively poor communication during their school years, they arrive at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf and think they are having 100% clear communication. But, if they have never had 100% clear communication, they may well be understanding only 80% without realizing, again, what they are missing. — location: [4541](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4541) ^ref-27821

Better executive function was found linked to spoken language ability among college students who used cochlear implants and who relied primarily on spoken language, and it was linked to better sign language ability and earlier ages of sign language acquisition in those students (without implants) who relied primarily on sign language. — location: [4599](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4599) ^ref-18910

Importantly, relations between language and executive function are somewhat different for deaf children who use cochlear implants than for their hearing peers. Explaining this would involve a lot of boring detail, but the research findings suggest that the way in which language supports executive function is different in the two populations. — location: [4603](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4603) ^ref-27935

DHH children in mainstream settings typically demonstrate higher levels of achievement than those in special school settings. Recent national studies have taken into account many of the factors related to school placement, but there are still issues of parent preference, school availability, and the quality of instruction in different settings. Even when such factors are taken into account, we have been able to account for only about 7% of the variability in DHH children’s academic achievement. Our best guess is that teachers account for most of the other 93%, at least half of it. What it is that skilled teachers of the deaf know and do that enables their DHH students to learn as much as hearing peers (given their own starting points) remains unclear. — location: [4637](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075KVN3LW&location=4637) ^ref-19283

DHH learners, for example, report that they generally spend less time studying than hearing peers.
