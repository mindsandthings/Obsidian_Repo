All descriptions should be observed by your viewpoint character. What is her emotional response? Does a certain smell bring back a memory or provide a sense of comfort? Is your heroine unaccustomed to wearing heels and afraid of tripping on the bumpy sidewalk? Does she hate the humidity for how it frizzes her hair or love how it moisturizes her skin? We see the world through our own lenses. So should your sleuth. — location: [157](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07GFHDWNW&location=157) ^ref-10974

Consider starting a series bible. In this document, you can include a map of your town, the street where your sleuth lives and/or works, and any particular locations that feature into your series as a whole. Put together a photo collage of your protagonist’s lifestyle in terms of clothing, hobbies, and other interests. Or do a collage for the locale. You can even start a Pinterest story board to share with readers. Make sure you use royalty-free images to avoid copyright issues and read the terms carefully. — location: [187](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07GFHDWNW&location=187) ^ref-48948

Historical Mysteries You might have to dig deeper to research historical details. Primary sources such as old maps, newspapers, magazines, and diaries can be helpful. Visiting the setting can provide sensory details as well as travel blogs. Read other mysteries set in the era so you get a sense of the time period and the language in use back then. Be careful of slang phrases and check when they originated. — location: [193](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07GFHDWNW&location=193) ^ref-59621

---

---
Decide where your series will take place. Why did you choose this location? What is unique about it? How can you get these qualities across to readers? What are some sensory details that you can use?
