## Highlights
Once you understand that a true index consists of an analyzed list of terms and concepts, with multiple access points provided through synonyms and cross-references, it’s easy to understand why a computer can’t produce a good index. — location: [350](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B013KOXH84&location=350) ^ref-13322

---
A computer-generated concordance is simply a list of every occurrence of a word in a text, contrary to Merriam-Webster’s definition of concordance as “an alphabetical index of the principal words in a book.”13 The issue here lies with the word “principal.” A principal word may occur many times in a text, but every mention may not merit a place in the index. Computers (at least at the time of this writing) can’t distinguish between substantive use and passing mention of specific words. — location: [353](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B013KOXH84&location=353) ^ref-41251

---
A concordance misses another hallmark of a well-prepared index by presenting long strings of unanalyzed page references. Entries in a user-friendly index should display no more than five or six page references at any main heading. More references require subentries. — location: [365](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B013KOXH84&location=365) ^ref-56380

quickly preview a book’s contents before buying the book or to find a specific fact they remember reading. A couple of examples illustrate the point. — location: [368](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B013KOXH84&location=368) ^ref-4555

---
When an author uses terms inconsistently, synonyms become a must in the index. — location: [405](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B013KOXH84&location=405) ^ref-11601

The Digital Trends Task Force (DTTF) of the American Society for Indexing was created in 2011 to address the rapid changes in book publishing related to indexing. The group has worked diligently to promote “smart indexes” for ebooks. — location: [436](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B013KOXH84&location=436) ^ref-41583

No, search is not the same as an index. Lori Lathrop’s words in 2000 still apply today: “Real indexing is simply beyond the capability of computer software. Only human indexers can intellectually analyze the material to provide end-users with a topical hierarchy, meaningful associations, and access to conceptual information.”20 — location: [440](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B013KOXH84&location=440) ^ref-53069

---
Mulvany’s words provide a bridge from the past to the future: “The back-of-the-book index is not a relic of seventeenth-century technology, rather, it is an excellent prototype of an efficient information access device. Master the art of book indexing, and you will experience the magic of sharing knowledge.”44 — location: [532](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B013KOXH84&location=532) ^ref-48432

Indexers work in various settings as employees, freelancers, and company owners. Most are freelance independent contractors. In fact, more than 80 percent identified themselves as independent contractors in ASI’s 2009 survey, and only 10 percent were salaried employees.8 Many chose the career because of the opportunity to work as a home-based freelancer. — location: [806](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B013KOXH84&location=806) ^ref-16513

---
most professional indexers are still writing back-of-the-book indexes for print books. — location: [959](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B013KOXH84&location=959) ^ref-4487

---
The Accidental Indexer survey confirmed that books still comprise most indexing work, followed by periodicals. The most frequently used indexes, however, are website indexes and other online finding tools. — location: [962](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B013KOXH84&location=962) ^ref-1854

“Closed-system indexing assists people in finding a unit or units of relevant information within a document, while open-system indexing is designed to facilitate the retrieval of one or more documents that contain relevant information.”5 In other words, closed-system indexing applies to a single document, such as a book, while open-system indexing applies to multiple documents, such as magazines and newspapers, or to large-scale information collections such as databases and websites. — location: [983](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B013KOXH84&location=983) ^ref-18105

---
Vocabulary creators, such as taxonomists and information architects, also distinguish between the two systems. A company might employ a taxonomist to develop a vocabulary, then use freelancers to index materials using the vocabulary. Not only are the vocabulary creators and its users different, but the vocabulary and the index created with it are two separate products and may even be sold separately to different end-users. — location: [994](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B013KOXH84&location=994) ^ref-28291

---
Time is another difference between open and closed systems. Indexers working on closed-system projects perform the work during pre-publishing production in a specific period of time. When the book is finally published, the project is complete. Indexers working on open-system projects may never be finished. Journals are indexed after publication, sometimes on an annual basis. Although annual indexes may be published for periodicals, the ongoing work of indexing the journal continues from year to year (as long as the journal is still being produced!). — location: [997](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B013KOXH84&location=997) ^ref-56868

---
Today’s information professionals will likely use terms other than open and closed when discussing the two systems. Taxonomies—which Heather Hedden describes as “knowledge organization systems or knowledge organization structures”8—is the more current word for open systems. — location: [1004](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B013KOXH84&location=1004) ^ref-15460

Do Mi Stauber’s excellent book Facing the Text14 has become a standard text on indexing method and is a must read, particularly for scholarly indexers. — location: [1062](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B013KOXH84&location=1062) ^ref-52511

Before committing to a project, ask the editor for a sample chapter or two and the working table of contents to review. This will help you determine whether your skills are a good match for the project. — location: [1064](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B013KOXH84&location=1064) ^ref-12828

taxonomies. Database indexers are adding, or keywording, information to an existing system. These systems are designed by taxonomists or information architects, and the indexers must follow the rules and use the vocabularies of that design. Adherence to the rules and vocabulary is essential for consistency and quality control since multiple indexers work on the same database. Database indexes provide access to vast amounts of information and their vocabularies require maintenance as information is added and the database grows. As terminology changes over time, additional maintenance is required. Examples of database indexes are the MEDLINE database of the National Library of Medicine (NML) and the EBSCO Information Services databases. Lawsuits with reams of discovery documents may also rely on database indexes for information management and retrieval. — location: [1129](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B013KOXH84&location=1129) ^ref-15387

If you are a beginner, you can gain experience by indexing a few published books for practice and comparing your work to the published index. If you are interested in culinary arts, index a cookbook. Bear in mind that your index won’t be exactly like the published one. In fact, if you’ve had good training, it may be better! Try a book with an award-winning index to learn from the best in the business. — location: [1686](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B013KOXH84&location=1686) ^ref-62562
