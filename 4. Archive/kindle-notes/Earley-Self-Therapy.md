## Highlights
If you aren’t sure whether you are in Self, ask yourself if it is all right for the target part to show up any way it needs to. Do you have a fixed view of the part? If you do, it means you aren’t openly curious about it. This tips you off that a concerned part has taken over that has an agenda for the target part; it needs to see the target part in a certain way.

Notice that part of the reason why the concerned part won’t step aside is that it doesn’t know the Self. The Watcher is partially blended with Self, so they are sharing the seat of consciousness, but it isn’t really aware of Self. We need more unblending for the work to proceed. — location: [1772](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1772) ^ref-38323

---
You could ask the scared part to move into a safe, comfortable room while you get to know the target part. This may reassure it enough for it to leave. You can also visualize the intimidating target part in a room where you are seeing it through a window, which provides containment. It lessens the fear that the target part might spontaneously attack. — location: [1828](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1828) ^ref-62354

---
You can foster trust by saying the following to the protector (if true): I understand why you (do your role). I appreciate your efforts on my behalf. I know you’ve been working very hard. — location: [1866](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1866) ^ref-6581

If you don’t notice any response after thanking the part, check to see if it is aware of you. You’ve been talking to it all this time, thinking you’re having a good conversation. How can it not be aware of you? But even though this may be surprising, sometimes the part doesn’t know you’re there. Sometimes a part is only aware of the past, not of you talking to it in the present. — location: [2343](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=2343) ^ref-6719

Sometimes protectors aren’t even aware of the exile they are protecting; they just have a sense of danger or pain that must be avoided. — location: [2349](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=2349) ^ref-19559

---
If this isn’t enough to reassure the protector, it may indicate that your life situation really isn’t safe enough for deep therapy work because there really are people in your life who would react badly if they saw your exiles or if you made substantial therapeutic changes. — location: [3121](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=3121) ^ref-6444

For example, it is afraid of activating a protector that would fly into a rage or go on a drinking binge. It might not be wrong; this is sometimes a real possibility. — location: [3145](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=3145) ^ref-34570

Most of us alternate between walling off our exiles and being flooded by their pain. So the exile’s experience is that the only way he canbe heard is to take you over. — location: [3387](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=3387) ^ref-53337

At the end of the session, ask the exile what she wants from you over the next week or two. Most likely, she will say that she wants you not to forget about her, to stay connected with her. This is very important. Check in with her every day over the next couple of weeks. Make a note to yourself to do this so that you don’t forget. If you do, it could undermine the good work you have just done. — location: [4213](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=4213) ^ref-12478
