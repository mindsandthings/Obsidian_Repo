## Highlights
The Zothique stories of Clark Ashton Smith, published between 1932 and 1948, pick up the thread of stellar death established by Wells and Stapledon with a new twist of the “future past” where mankind lives on a southern continent and dabbles with necromancy while the red sun grows cold. This notion is further honed by Jack Vance’s The Dying Earth (1950), where the forgotten magic and superscience (nearly indistinguishable from each other) are sought after by sardonic and cunning magicians and rogues. Wolfe seems to have applied Clarke’s Law to Vance’s world, insisting that superscience is magic, and vice versa, and while Wolfe has openly acknowledged Smith and Vance as providing the impetus for the Urth Cycle, there is also a certain amount of Wells and Stapledon present as well. — location: [498](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01HIMMGXQ&location=498) ^ref-25482

To paraphrase: the age begins when a starfaring people (probably Asiatic, if not Chinese) leave their “wild half” (emotions, fears, and feelings) behind and establish the First Empire upon Order alone. As the Empire expands to encompass one thousand stars, the wild half is sold to the “thinking engines” (computers) and “androids” (mechanical men), who then set out to ruin their makers. — location: [586](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01HIMMGXQ&location=586) ^ref-39064

As well as reintroducing thoughts of fortune, revenge, the invisible world, and the like, the machines also gave each man and woman a companion (i.e., an “eidolon” or “aquastor”), unseen by other eyes, as an adviser. But the machines grow weaker over time and become unable to maintain the aquastors or build any more cities — attaining that point of senility at which they had hoped that mankind would turn against them and destroy them. — location: [592](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01HIMMGXQ&location=592) ^ref-12375

The Age of the Monarch is the pinnacle of magical superscience: the source of fliers, thinking machines capable of reading minds and projecting aquastors, — location: [600](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01HIMMGXQ&location=600) ^ref-56022
