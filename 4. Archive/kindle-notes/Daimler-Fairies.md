---
I’d note that entering an active fairy ring is considered dangerous, as it can radically alter our sense of time and a night dancing with the fey can translate to anywhere between seven and a hundred years passing in our world. — location: [185](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=185) ^ref-18107

---
In Iceland both road construction and drilling that upsets the Hidden Folk tends to result in machinery breaking, ill luck, and strange happenings until the construction stops or the damage – usually to a boulder that is associated with them – is repaired. — location: [216](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=216) ^ref-44283

It goes by many names: Fairy, Fairyland, Elfland, Elfhame, Elphame, Elvenland, an Saol Eile (the Otherworld), and in other cultures there are places that may be analogous to the Celtic Fairy, such as Ljossalfheim. These places aren’t the same place, — location: [249](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=249) ^ref-63273

---
gradually came to be associated more strongly with the land of the dead (Firth-Green, 2016). There was also an association of Fairy with Purgatory, reinforced by medieval stories that explicitly connected the two, although it was never clear that they were in fact the same place (Firth-Green, 2016). — location: [268](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=268) ^ref-28078

---
We see a variety of stories where a person joins a fairy dance for what they believe is only a single night only to find at dawn that years, decades, or even a century has passed while they danced. — location: [281](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=281) ^ref-35597

---
One description says that Fairy has no sun, moon, or stars, and that all its springs contain blood, which flows there from the mortal world (Acland, 1997). The blood in the water could be a metaphor for the connection between fairies and the mortal dead, — location: [289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=289) ^ref-9464

---
When we study the stories we find three main patterns emerging: gaining the return of people by threatening something the fairies value, rescue by passing trials to free them, or exchanging something else for the person. — location: [355](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=355) ^ref-11202

Even those who go willingly to Fairy must adhere to specific prohibitions to stay there. — location: [363](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=363) ^ref-30222

The Fey Folk seem swift to punish even those who they have adopted as their own, when those people break rules set upon them. — location: [368](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=368) ^ref-1745

---
In Irish tradition there were and are those who regularly visit Fairyland and they are also thought to be slightly odd or unlike other people. I have heard it called being ‘touched by the fairies’, ‘off with the fairies’ or ‘away with the fairies’, which are also euphemisms for being eccentric or slightly mad. — location: [381](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=381) ^ref-53147

---
we see it in stories like that of the Green Children (see Katherine Briggs entry under that heading in her 1976 Dictionary of Fairies) where beings of Fairy have all that makes them fey stripped away, are fed mortal food and clothed in mortal clothes, are baptized, and eventually lose their Otherworldly essence and become mortal entirely.

In one notable tale a boy who was taken by the fairies steals a golden ball from them and finds his way back out of Fairyland to make a gift of the ball to his mother — location: [427](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=427) ^ref-54847

(Grimm, 1883). He also states that Elves are strongly connected to butterflies because both are ‘the product of repeated changes of form’ (Grimm, 1883, p 462). — location: [437](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=437) ^ref-48150

---
Some fairies are said to use glamour to make their food appear as delicious fare like to what humans would eat when really it is leaves, weeds, roots, and ‘stalks of heather’ (Briggs, 1976). — location: [467](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=467) ^ref-16338

---
Several types of fairies, including Hags, Kelpies and Water Horses, are known to eat human flesh. Briggs mentions one such reference to a fairy court’s feast, which consisted of the prepared and cooked body of an old woman (Briggs, 1976, p 145). Similarly tales of the Hag Black Annis mention her penchant for eating children; Kelpies can trick people into riding them, tear them apart and eat them (Briggs, 1976). — location: [469](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=469) ^ref-29377

---
It is said that some Irish fairies eat fruits, vegetables, honey, and drink milk, but do not eat meat (Lysaght, 1991). — location: [474](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=474) ^ref-48376

---
It is said that some fairies eat rowan berries. Indeed, rowan berries were also said to have been the food of the Tuatha De Danann by some accounts (McNeill, 1956). — location: [479](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=479) ^ref-16340

---
Green is probably the most well known of fairy colors. — location: [496](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=496) ^ref-35601

---
In Irish mythology when a figure appears who is described as ‘red’ or wearing all red they are almost invariably Otherworldly in nature, something we see in Togail Bruidne Dá Derga as well as the Táin Bó Regamna. Red in Irish mythology is a color associated with blood and more generally with death by violence; — location: [509](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=509) ^ref-34174

---
They may also appear dressed entirely in red, although this could be considered a bad omen, relating to an anecdotal tale of a red clad fairy who would appear at births to foretell the baby’s death — location: [514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=514) ^ref-25914

---
In Old Irish white was a color that among other things was associated with corpses of the battle dead, which were described as bloodless. — location: [523](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=523) ^ref-44363

---
Black is generally speaking an ill-omened color. To see a fairy wearing black was an omen of death, although not necessarily for the person seeing it (Ballard, 1991). — location: [531](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=531) ^ref-55799

---
The Good Neighbors are private beings and this is seen in a variety of ways, but one sure method of angering them is to violate that privacy or to speak too openly about experiences you have with them. — location: [551](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=551) ^ref-63679

---
Katherine Briggs outlines three basic tenets of fairy privacy, that is that they dislike being watched, don’t want people trespassing on their land, and don’t want people they show favor to bragging about or even in most cases talking about the good things they receive from the fairies (Briggs, 1976). — location: [558](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=558) ^ref-35963

---
Those who steal from the Other Crowd do so at great peril, although the reverse does not hold true as the Fey Folk are well known for taking from mortals, especially milk, food, and people. Herein lies another valuable lesson in dealing with Themselves: do not think that imitating their own behavior will gain you anything, but understand that there are different rules for fairies and mortals. — location: [561](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=561) ^ref-42109

---
Oddly although fairies willingly steal from humans they also sometimes borrow from people with proper manners, asking permission first and promising repayment, although the repayment is not always in kind and can be for a greater value than what was borrowed (Briggs, 1976). — location: [574](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=574) ^ref-27979

---
It is also possible to borrow safely from the Fey Folk, if a person is polite in the asking and scrupulous in the repayment. — location: [576](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=576) ^ref-25697

---
The Good Neighbors are always strictly honest with their words and they expect the same from the humans they deal with. No fairy will say anything that is not strictly true nor will they break a promise (Briggs, 1967). Lying to any member of Fairy is rarely a good idea, as is breaking your word with them. Even the worst of what we would call the Unseelie will not lie, although they can easily twist the truth around so far that their words are taken to mean something else entirely. Semantics is an art form among the fairies. In this way talking to the Fey Folk requires a very different mindset than talking to a human being, because while we may assume a human is lying and look for the dishonesty in their words we will be caught in the trap that the fairies weave with the truth of their words. — location: [580](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=580) ^ref-31660

---
It would be fair to say that fairies embrace a much more hedonistic attitude than most human societies and religions, which can also confuse people who find it difficult to reconcile the fairies’ embracing sexual and personal freedoms with policies of strict honesty and adherence to oaths. — location: [587](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=587) ^ref-53590

---
There are also some general characteristics that fairies prefer in both people and, it seems, themselves. These include generosity, politeness, cleanliness, and cheerfulness (Briggs, 1976). — location: [598](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=598) ^ref-44545

---
Fairies also prefer people who have happy hearts and merry dispositions, generally speaking, although some do — location: [603](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=603) ^ref-5401

---
Punishments, however, are usually harsh and can include years of illness, painful physical maladies, madness, ill luck, and death. — location: [607](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=607) ^ref-25756

---
There is an old Celtic belief, recorded by the Greeks and Romans, which hints at the idea of rebirth or reincarnation, that a person born in our world was dying in the Other World and a person who died in this world was born in the Other World. — location: [614](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=614) ^ref-24830

---
sometimes fairies are known to take people to join them and often these people were thought to have died. — location: [627](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=627) ^ref-1728

---
This belief is directly related to the modern belief that the fairies can also influence the health or failure of crops — location: [707](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=707) ^ref-29666

---
The Seelie Court is described in relation to the fairies specifically as the ‘pleasant or happy court, or court of the pleasant and happy people’ and is also given as a general term for all fairies (Jamieson, 1808). In folklore the Seelie Court can act benevolently at times for no reason other than the sake of kindness, — location: [772](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=772) ^ref-60236

---
The Unseelie Court is described as always unfavorable to humans and is closely linked to the Slua Sí, the malicious Fairy Host who torment people and cause illness and death where they visit (Briggs, 1976). The Slua itself is strongly tied to the dead and is known to kidnap hapless mortals and force them to help with the Host’s entertainment, usually harming other humans, before dropping them in a location far from where they were grabbed. The Unseelie Court comprises many solitary fairies of a malicious nature, those who feed on or enjoy hurting mortals for sport, although not all Unseelie fairies are solitary (Briggs, 1976). The Unseelie Court was seen as constantly ready to cause harm or injury to mortals and was avoided as much as possible, and many different protections existed against it (McNeill, 1956; Briggs, 1976). — location: [789](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=789) ^ref-47951

---
Because, you see, it’s not that you have to worry about transgressing and angering them, or being rude and angering them, or anything like that; all you have to do is be at the wrong place at the wrong time and get their attention and they will be inclined to do you harm. Like a tornado or a hungry apex predator, it won’t be personal, but it could be deadly. — location: [869](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=869) ^ref-12707

Most of the truly frightening or dangerous fairies are solitary, particularly those associated with water of any kind. As — location: [898](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=898) ^ref-63109

There’s no real set list of location-based fairies, but the most common would probably be domestic fairies4, mine fairies, water fairies, wilderness fairies, and mountain fairies. — location: [904](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=904) ^ref-48771

---
Mine fairies can be either helpful or harmful, depending on what type of fairy they are. The helpful ones will assist miners by warning of danger and by signaling where to dig to find deposits of ore or minerals; harmful mine fairies in contrast can cause cave-ins and terrify miners with noises and dangerous pranks. — location: [912](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=912) ^ref-31858

---
They can be extremely dangerous, such as the Hags who are known to drown children, or helpful like the Merrows who aid sailors in storms. — location: [915](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=915) ^ref-52292

---
The two courts are mainly a Scottish viewpoint, while trooping and solitary is an Irish view, and location-based is often seen in Wales. — location: [930](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=930) ^ref-62516

The Irish system is based on a multitude of sí (fairy hills) ruled by different kings and queens, with each being its own kingdom in a way. — location: [938](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=938) ^ref-58877

---
It may also be related to the Irish word for ‘bone’ cnáim, hence cnámhín ‘little bones’, which is the etymology I personally favor, daughter of little bones being so very evocative. Ultimately it is uncertain what the name means. — location: [1091](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1091) ^ref-6279

---
The great Scottish poet Dunbar has made a spirited description of this Hecate riding at the head of witches and good neighbours (fairies, namely), sorceresses and elves, indifferently, upon the ghostly eve of All-Hallow Mass. (Scott, 1830) — location: [1096](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1096) ^ref-48972

---
For those who are looking for a more exhaustive listing of every type of fairy, particularly Celtic, I recommend Katherine Briggs book A Dictionary of Fairies, which is both relatively complete and in-depth in its listing and also well researched. — location: [1148](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1148) ^ref-37202

On the quarter days – Samhain, Imbolc, Bealtaine, and Lughnasa – they move their homes from one hill to another, traveling along established fairy roads (McNeill, 1956). — location: [1176](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1176) ^ref-61575

---
Physical descriptions of the Aos Sí are fairly consistent, they are generally said to be very similar to humans in height and overall appearance, usually pale, fair-haired, and finely dressed (O hOgain, 2006). — location: [1182](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1182) ^ref-42572

In stories they are often said to wear green or grey primarily and may have blond or brown hair; — location: [1185](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1185) ^ref-28187

The Fair Folk ride on fine horses and are seen in the company of hounds; generally these animals are either black, white, or grey. — location: [1213](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1213) ^ref-64464

---
The Aos Sí are especially active on the quarter days, Samhain, Imbolc, Bealtaine, and Lughnasa. Samhain and Bealtaine in particular are times of very strong fairy influence and so great care should be taken to avoid running afoul of them during these periods (O hOgain, 2006). — location: [1215](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1215) ^ref-37975

A variety of monstrous female fairies fall into this category all sharing common characteristics and habits. Usually known by specific names such as Black Annis, Jenny Greenteeth, and Peg Powler, these fairies often lurk in rivers and reach out to pull in and drown unwary or misbehaving children (Cox, 1904; Briggs, 1976). Most Hags are specific to a location and are known in that area’s folklore. Black Annis lived in the hills of Leicestershire and was said to have a blue face and iron claws, as well as an association with a gigantic cat (Briggs, 1976). Jenny Greenteeth was local to Lancashire and favored stagnant pools, while Peg Powler haunted the river Tees (Briggs, 1976). — location: [1418](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1418) ^ref-18901

---
Yeats described this spirit as one that sought to seduce mortals, and if successful would feed on their life energy while inspiring their creativity; the only escape according to him was to find another to replace yourself in her affections, or else you would be bound to her even beyond death (Yeats, 1888). This — location: [1429](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1429) ^ref-58123

---
Although usually described as female there is a version of the dangerously seductive Leannán Sí that is male – the Gean-Cánach, or ‘Love Talker’. He appears as an attractive young man smoking a pipe, walking in the untamed places, and is quick to seduce women when he can, after which they lose the will to live (Briggs, 1967). — location: [1439](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1439) ^ref-59391

---
the Love Talker only lays once with his victim then departs never to be seen again, leaving her to waste away for want of him (or perhaps because he has stolen some vital life energy from her) while the Leannán Sí is a regular visitor to her victim throughout his life and possibly afterwards. — location: [1444](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1444) ^ref-27716

A Land Spirit may be the embodiment of a river, tree, rock, or other physical object in our world, for example. Unlike a fairy who makes a home in a river, a Land Spirit is the actual soul of that river and it is bound to the health and physical existence of that river. If — location: [1505](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1505) ^ref-23654

Another well-known Pixie trick is leading travelers astray in familiar territory. Referred to as being Pixy-led, it is an extremely disconcerting feeling. — location: [1537](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1537) ^ref-11436

---
The effect can last for minutes or hours, and can be broken by turning an item of clothing inside out, pulling some bread from a pocket and leaving it, or showing a wooden cross if you have one on your person. Pixies create fairy rings by riding horses they’ve stolen in circles; to step fully into such a circle is to be lost to Fairy, while setting only one foot inside grants the ability to see the Pixies (Briggs, 1976). — location: [1540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1540) ^ref-6015

These fairies appear as wizened old men, bucktoothed, talon fingered, bearing a pike, and clad in iron boots and a grisly Red Cap that is dyed in human blood (Briggs, 1976). — location: [1587](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1587) ^ref-59543

seal skin, at which point they appear human, but their stories make it clear this is not an innate magic, but a power invested in the seal skin itself (Briggs, 1976). — location: [1599](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1599) ^ref-10128

The Slua travels in whirlwinds, or on the wind more generally and because of this the whirlwind is called the Séideán Sídhe (fairy blast) or Sitheadh Gaoithe (thrust of wind) and sometimes by the similar sounding name of Sí Gaoithe (fairy wind) — location: [1641](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1641) ^ref-42231

---
These endeavors often included kidnapping other people including brides, a common theme in many different types of fairy stories, and doing the new victim mischief. Anyone caught out alone, especially at night, or in a place they shouldn’t be in could be swept up by the Slua with little choice but to go along with the Fairy Host until they were released. — location: [1647](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1647) ^ref-62773

---
The Slua may include fairy horses, hounds, and a variety of fairy beings, as well as the human dead. In Scotland some people believe that the Slua Sí, who are also called the Fairy Host of the Air, are spirits of those humans who died with unforgiven sins or filled with sin — location: [1657](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1657) ^ref-59656

Fairy cats are usually viewed as malicious spirits and they have a strong association with the dead, but unlike other fairies this isn’t because they are believed to be the dead themselves, but rather that they are thought to steal newly dead souls. — location: [1730](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1730) ^ref-2437

Fairies are best known for appearing at liminal times, especially dawn and dusk, but also midnight.

The fairies are also apparently tied to the cycle of the moon. The full moon and the days immediately before and after it are days of fairy activity (Briggs, 1967). — location: [1818](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1818) ^ref-10813

A household’s luck was intrinsically tied to the items that symbolized it – milk, butter, salt, and fire – and to give any of these to supernatural beings such as the Fair Folk was to voluntarily give them power over you; to do this particularly on Bealtaine or the other fire festivals, when spirits of all kinds were abroad and their powers especially strong, was the height of foolishness. — location: [1830](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1830) ^ref-44821

it was traditional to make offerings on Bealtaine morning of milk poured at the base of a fairy thorn or on the threshold of the house, and to take the cows to the sí and bleed them, with some of the blood tasted by the people and the rest given as an offering to the fairies (Evans, 1957). — location: [1844](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1844) ^ref-54753

Generally the encounters with fairies on midsummer in folklore are of a more benevolent or playful nature, — location: [1854](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1854) ^ref-45793

Bonfires are lit at midsummer for luck, blessing, and protection and the ashes of these fires have many uses in protective charms. — location: [1860](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1860) ^ref-9695

There is another very old belief relating to the harvest, that is that the fairies took a tithe of all that was gathered and that the best of what was gathered belonged to them. — location: [1876](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1876) ^ref-52778

While we see Queen Mab referred to as the midwife of the fairies, generally speaking it would seem that midwives were a rare commodity and when a woman was ready to deliver a baby the fairies looked to humans for assistance. — location: [1930](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1930) ^ref-35806

the fairies have long been known to take food as well as milk from people. It is possible that this does not have the same effect on them when they take it from us because it is owed to them as part of their due for blessing the harvest and prosperity of the herds. — location: [1964](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1964) ^ref-51903

The fairies are famous both for their love of musicians and for their own enchanting music. The fairies love good music and dancing and they appreciate true musical talent. — location: [1974](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1974) ^ref-65407

musicians are generally only borrowed, sometimes for as little as a single night, to provide entertainment for the fairies. — location: [1977](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1977) ^ref-27381

To hear the music of Fairy often means to be enchanted and entrapped by the Otherworld. Many who hear this music never entirely escape the allure of its melody, although some are blessed with great inspiration from it. — location: [1983](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1983) ^ref-55381

Fairy rings appear as either a dark circle of grass or as mushrooms growing together in a ring, and less often as a circle of small stones. — location: [1993](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1993) ^ref-13666

---
Fairy rings can appear in different sizes, from three feet across to ten times that size (Bennett, 1991; Gwyndaf, 1991). If they were the sort made of darker green within a field of grass then they would be either moss or much darker green grass and were notable because ‘no rushes or anything grew on it’ (Gwyndaf, 1991). — location: [1997](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=1997) ^ref-6112

Some fairy rings appear to have been used as a sort of trap to intentionally lure mortals, especially children, that the Fey Folk wished to take and these people if they entered the ring would never be returned (Evans-Wentz, 1911). — location: [2011](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=2011) ^ref-5504

iron is seen as superlative method of both disrupting a fairy ring and protecting oneself from angry fey (Hartland, 1891). Any iron object would suffice and could be used to break the edge of the ring or could be tossed into the circle to disrupt the dancing. — location: [2021](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=2021) ^ref-53083

The teind is based in the idea that the fairies must pay a tribute to Hell on a regular basis, generally said to be every seven years (Briggs, 1976). — location: [2053](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=2053) ^ref-46923

Elfshot by any of the many names it has gone by – elf-arrows, fairy arrows, fairy darts, fairy stones, saighead sith – are fascinating items. Terribly dangerous if they strike a person or animal they are a fearsome weapon of the Good People. Their effects can be transitory or permanent and may be mitigated with magical charms and herbal cures, and ironically the same exact shot that causes the injury can be used to cure it when wielded by a well-intentioned human hand. As dangerous as elfshot can be if it strikes a person, it is also a wonderful talisman to possess if you happen to find one – but only if you remember to keep it with proper care, away from sunlight and off the ground, lest the Good Folk come back to reclaim it. — location: [2153](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=2153) ^ref-51080

Katherine Briggs suggests three main themes for the poem Goblin Market as well: the violation of fairy privacy by looking at them, the breaking of the taboo of eating fairy food, and the rescue of a person from Fairyland (Briggs, 1976). — location: [2208](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=2208) ^ref-40417

One of the most widespread stories found in fairylore across different Celtic cultures is that of the borrowed midwife who anoints the baby’s eyes and accidently touches her own, only to be granted true sight and realize that she has delivered the half-fairy child of a local girl2. This girl has been taken into Fairy as the wife of one of its inhabitants and obviously just proven that humans and fairies are in fact cross-fertile. Which shouldn’t be surprising since one of the leading theories about changelings is that fairies steal people to supplement their own population, — location: [2298](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=2298) ^ref-58019

Before you go rushing out to find a fairy lover of your own it is worth considering that as often as not these things end badly. And by badly I mean with the death of the mortal partner, sometimes through mischance and sometimes through violence. In other stories the mortal violates a taboo – a geis – set down by the fairy partner and loses them forever, which generally drives the mortal mad. — location: [2326](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=2326) ^ref-19115

The cures for these Elf-sicknesses and possessions were given along with remedies for demonic possession, seizures, and nightmares, perhaps giving us an idea of the sort of things fairy possession was associated with. — location: [2335](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=2335) ^ref-53308

Within the past decade or so there have been several young adult fiction series and paranormal romance series that have featured the idea of either a Summer and Winter Court of the Fairies or of courts based on all four seasons, or who use the terms Seelie and Unseelie, but also incorporate Summer and Winter as nicknames for each. This concept has been adopted into fairylore more generally by those who dislike the hard Seelie = good, Unseelie = bad division and feel that Summer and Winter are more ambiguous — location: [2580](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=2580) ^ref-5318

In folklore, however, and many anecdotal accounts the Good People appear in a wide array of forms from animal to human-like from tiny to giant, from beautiful to monstrous. Wings are actually very uncommon features that seems to have been added within the past couple of hundred years, initially in theater productions and later artwork. — location: [2619](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=2619) ^ref-9938

But the truth is everything has a cost and the Fair Folk are often quite tit-for-tat in their approach to things. If you do them a favor they will pay you back, because they abhor being in anyone’s debt; by the same token if they do something for you, especially at your request, they will — location: [2901](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=2901) ^ref-46429

Although there is a prohibition against saying ‘thank you’3, which many people I know agree is best to follow; say something else instead, which isn’t ‘thanks’ such as ‘I appreciate this’ or ‘this was exactly what was needed’. — location: [2925](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=2925) ^ref-43656

Firstly, why do we make offerings from a traditional perspective? The main reason historically was twofold: to propitiate the spirits for blessing or to prevent harm, or to maintain an agreed upon exchange. In the first case, when applied to the Good Neighbors, the idea was that if we offered to them willingly they would not take from us forcibly so we see practices like milk being offered at fairy trees or cows being bled in fairy forts on holy days such as Bealtaine. — location: [2970](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=2970) ^ref-23901

A more modern, but still useful method, is the use of iron water. Fill a small spray bottle with water and add iron filings, iron dust, or a piece of iron, and allow to sit for a few days. The water can be sprayed into a room or around the home as needed. — location: [3121](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=3121) ^ref-18779

Although not as widely recommended as iron, salt also has protective qualities. In some cases salt works better than iron at driving out dangerous fairies. Salt was sprinkled on cows who had just calved to protect them from fairy influence, salt was used with fire and water to bless pastures, and salt was used to protect butter from the influence of fairies and witches (McNeill, 1962). — location: [3132](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0784PWR2H&location=3132) ^ref-37103
