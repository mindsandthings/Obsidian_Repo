## Highlights
The disorder would not be as devastating as low-functioning autism, my expectant parents were told, but it was still on the autism spectrum. I would be slow to grasp social rules, and possibly violent. I might be unable to hold a job. I might be gifted in some extraordinary way, but I would never gain fluent skills in relating to normal humans. Even if I were able to support myself, I would always be, in effect, a nerd. — location: [91](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004QOAVW8&location=91) ^ref-48722

“Maybe they’re teasing you, maybe they’re trying to get you mad— but don’t let them get to you, or you will be the one who gets in trouble. You have a choice, Karrie. Don’t give them what they want. When other kids pick on you, just ignore them. Otherwise you’re encouraging them.” He emphasized the words, drawing them out, long and slow and clear, as if he were teaching them to me, as if it were the first time I’d ever heard them.

I really shouldn’t have unstrapped it from my wrist in the first place. I’m too clumsy.” — location: [340](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004QOAVW8&location=340) ^ref-54109

“Language is one of my obsessions, I guess. I make palindromes, poems, puns...” I laughed as I noticed the pattern that was forming. — location: [404](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004QOAVW8&location=404) ^ref-29040

Through drawings full of secret letters and diagrams, we invented it together, taking the risk of spending hours on the yellow shirt. — location: [415](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004QOAVW8&location=415) ^ref-13173

“When I was ten, I did really well on the technical aptitude test,” he explained, moving his pieces across the chessboard as we sat on his bed. “Even better than most boys with an Asperger’s diagnosis. — location: [438](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004QOAVW8&location=438) ^ref-65387

Blaro was right, you are some kind of emotionless machine.” “She was also right that it has its advantages,” Draz said. “I don’t have an emotional connection to pain. When something hurts, I don’t feel bad. I just know that my body is damaged. Usually that means I can solve the problem better than I could if I were panicking about it.” — location: [7542](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004QOAVW8&location=7542) ^ref-58592

“There are some people on this ship who are so disabled that they don’t really care who they rely on, and some of them might need help that our robot technology can’t manage. I think we should also find volunteers from among the rems, BGs and BG kids... people who are willing to work as personal care attendants for the more severely disabled rems.” — location: [9157](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004QOAVW8&location=9157) ^ref-19888
