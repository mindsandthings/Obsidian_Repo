## Highlights
CONCEPT—The idea or seed that evolves into a platform for a story. Best and most empowering when expressed as a “what if?” question. The answer leads to further “what if?” questions in a branching and descending hierarchy, and the collective whole of those choices and answers becomes your story. CHARACTER—Don’t leave home without one. Every story needs a hero. We don’t need to like him (contrary to what your high school composition teacher told you), but we do need to root for him. THEME —Yes, it’s like putting smoke into a bottle, but it can be done. Not to be confused with concept, theme is what your story is illuminating about real life. STRUCTURE—What comes first, what comes next, and so forth … and why. And no, you can’t just make it up for yourself. There are expectations and standards here. Knowing what they are is the first step toward getting published. SCENE EXECUTION—You can know the game, but if you can’t play it well you can’t win. A story is a series of scenes with some connective tissue in place. And there are principles and guidelines to make them work. WRITING VOICE—The coat of paint, or if you prefer, the suit of clothes, that delivers the story to the reader. The biggest risk here is letting your writing voice get in the way. Less is more. Sparingly clever or sparsely eloquent is even better. — location: [431](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=431) ^ref-39851

WHERE DOES A STORY IDEA COME FROM? This is one of the most common questions writers are asked. It could be a dream that causes you to bolt upright in the night. It could be a random thought at the most unexpected of moments. It could be a notion that has haunted you for decades. But always, it will be derived from one and only one of the four essential elements of a story—concept, character, theme, or sequential structure. — location: [491](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=491) ^ref-14168

An idea is to travel to Florida. A concept is to travel by car and stop at all the national parks along the way. A premise is to take your estranged father with you and mend fences while on the road. Now let’s put that notion in literary terms, looking at the initial seed of a story. An idea would be to write a story about raising the Titanic from the bottom on the sea. A great idea. A concept would be to suggest that there are secrets still hidden there that certain forces would kill to keep concealed. A premise would be to create an archetypical hero who is hired to do this job and in doing so saves his country from potential attack. — location: [549](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=549) ^ref-49424

The idea to write a story about ballet dancers is not a concept. It is just an idea. But when you add a forward-thinking realm to that idea, and do it in the form of a question—what if a ballet dancer loses her leg at the knee but perseveres against great prejudice to become a professional dancer?—you have evolved the idea into the realm of conceptualization. — location: [563](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=563) ^ref-12083

---
altogether. An idea is always a subset of concept. A concept is a subset of premise. But neither the idea nor the premise becomes a story without a qualifying concept. — location: [599](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=599) ^ref-39905

---
After a hook and a setup the hero begins a quest, the pursuit of a need or a solution, from which springs a specific goal (survival, revenge, happiness, health, peace, wealth, justice, etc.), and then must square off with and ultimately conquer (or not) obstacles—this being the most critical element of storytelling: conflict. You then toss in a few inner demons as well as some exterior antagonistic forces, giving the hero something to battle and outwit and conquer as he strives to reach his goal. A good concept makes all that easy to buy into. — location: [699](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=699) ^ref-58847

---
First, if the concept is rich and compelling to any degree, phrasing it as a “what if?” question will not only be possible, it will be clarifying and empowering. — location: [744](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=744) ^ref-41365

THE SEVEN KEY CHARACTERIZATION VARIABLES Think of these as realms, as areas of potential character illumination. Here they are, in no particular order: Surface affectations and personality—What the world sees and perceives about a character, including quirks, ticks, habits, and visual presentation. Backstory—All that happened in the character’s life before the story begins that conspires to make him who he is now. Character arc—How the character learns lessons and grows (changes) over the course of the story, how she evolves and conquers her most confounding issues. Inner demons and conflicts—The nature of the issues that hold a character back and define his outlook, beliefs, decisions, and actions. Fear of meeting new people, for example, is a demon that definitely compromises one’s life experience. Worldview—An adopted belief system and moral compass; the manifested outcome of backstory and inner demons. Goals and motivations—What drives a character’s decisions and actions, and the belief that the benefits of those decisions and actions outweigh any costs or compromises. Decisions, actions, and behaviors—The ultimate decisions and actions that are the sum of all of the above. — location: [923](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=923) ^ref-55293

THE FIRST DIMENSION OF CHARACTER— SURFACE TRAITS, QUIRKS, AND HABITS Think of this as the exterior landscape of your characters. Their personality. What the world sees and assigns meaning to. Or not. Sometimes the meaning assigned by an observer of these surface quirks is quite contrary to the character’s intention. Imagine a forty-eight-year-old out-of-shape guy wearing a Tapout ball cap … sideways. — location: [1071](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=1071) ^ref-59620

---
This first dimension shows the way a character looks and acts … her hair, her make-up, the kind of car she drives, her wardrobe preferences, where she hangs out, her musical tastes, her taste in food, certain attitudes and prejudices, and so forth. It is largely a combination of two things: how she sees herself, and how she desires to be seen. — location: [1075](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=1075) ^ref-65470

---
What is the issue, in terms of pegging which of the three dimensions we’re seeing in play, is what the character strives to wear as a mask, an outward identity. — location: [1080](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=1080) ^ref-26799

---
In the first dimension of character (which includes the list above), what you show the reader about your character simply exists. You leave it to the reader to assign meaning. If a character chooses to drive a fifteen-year-old Corvette with torn leather seats, the reader may or may not assign meaning to this choice. Because it may or may not mean anything at all. And the second you do show the reader what’s behind these first-dimension tidbits of characterization, you’ve just crossed over into the second dimension. — location: [1084](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=1084) ^ref-34580

---
In the second dimension of character, the reader learns the reason for choices and behaviors that define outward perception, or the effort to control it, which may or may not align with any meaning the reader has assigned to it on her own. Here in the second dimension, the writer strives to expose the backstory, agenda, and meaning behind those first-dimension issues of characterization. — location: [1088](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=1088) ^ref-17771

---
In the third dimension of character, all of the choices made at the first-dimension level become subordinated to more important choices and behaviors made when greater weight and consequences are at stake. If the character has to wreck his Corvette in order to avoid hitting a dog, for example, in spite of what it means to him, this is a third-dimension variable because it indicates the heart and soul, if not the moral compass, of the character. First-dimension and second-dimension indicators, which tempt us to assign meaning, don’t always align with third-dimension choices. Also, third-dimension choices in that latter part of a story become the primary means of demonstrating character growth, known as character arc. In the previous example about the cheating spouse, the moment adultery occurs is a choice that defines his deepest, truest character, which is precisely what the third dimension delivers to the reader. In this example, the reader sees this guy from three perspectives, each of them one of the three dimensions of character. — location: [1095](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=1095) ^ref-17877

---
Peripheral characters in our stories are usually one-dimensional, as they should be. In fact, it’s a mistake to delve too deeply into peripheral characters merely for the sake of adding depth. — location: [1114](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=1114) ^ref-60243

---
Rule of thumb: Never extend the time a peripheral role player occupies in a story for the sake of deepening his character. — location: [1125](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=1125) ^ref-18362

---
With only these two dimensions in evidence, you either assign meaning to the first (he’s a really nice, cool guy) or to the second (he’s actually an unemployable schmuck who’s faking it). When it counts, which guy will show up? We don’t really know until a third dimension of character emerges. In other words, his true character emerges, eventually, through his choices when there is something at stake. — location: [1164](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=1164) ^ref-10014

---
But without the plot, the character has no stage upon which to show the reader both the character’s surface and true self. — location: [1188](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=1188) ^ref-54366

---
A villain, on the other hand, rationalizes behavior and is insensitive to, or refuses to accept responsibility for, the associated costs and violations of accepted social standards. — location: [1213](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=1213) ^ref-54881

---
Even if he does have a sense of right and wrong—itself a nice touch of complexity in a hero—he makes selfish and insensitive choices when there are stakes on the line, sometimes kidding himself (and believing it) that losses and darkness are acceptable in lieu of a greater good. — location: [1215](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=1215) ^ref-14014

---
While it is clear that the first two dimensions may or may not dictate the third, that doesn’t render them frivolous. In fact, they are key to the crafting of layered characters. Real life is a showcase for all three dimensions of characterization, so our stories should do no less. — location: [1251](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=1251) ^ref-23497

---
As a writer crafting such a scene, you should have a keen handle on all three dimensions—how your hero tries to appear before the wheels come off (first dimension), an understanding of why his emotions are teetering on the edge of a cliff the moment his ex-lover walks in (second-dimension), and the ultimate choice of behavior (third dimension). — location: [1393](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=1393) ^ref-54083

---
Notice how the second dimension doesn’t dictate the hero’s choice, but rather it illuminates the hero’s motivations. — location: [1396](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J35J8W&location=1396) ^ref-15994
