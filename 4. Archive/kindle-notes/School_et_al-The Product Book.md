## Highlights
Put simply, a product manager (PM) represents the customer No one buys a product because they want to give the company money. Customers buy and use products because the products address their needs.

project manager owns the schedule and helps ensure the team is on track to meet any deadlines. The project manager will often work with the product manager, and a product manager will provide input on the schedule.

Apple generally splits the product manager role into the “Engineering Program Manager” (EPM), and the “Product Marketing Manager” (PMM), with the PMM being closer to our definition a product manager, and the EPM being closer to a project manager. — location: [76](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B071HFBGXR&location=76) ^ref-15220

The most common type of product manager is someone with an engineering/computer science background who became interested in business.

strategic company context questions you should know the answer to: What is the company building now? What does it excel at compared to its competitors? Who are the key customers you aim to solve a problem for? What’s the company’s vision, and—more fundamentally—why does the company exist? — location: [182](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B071HFBGXR&location=182) ^ref-22175
