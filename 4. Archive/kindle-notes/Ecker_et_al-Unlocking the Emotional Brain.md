## Highlights
In counteractive change or emotional regulation, new learning creates circuits and memory that are neuroanatomically separate from the existing circuits of unwanted old learnings. — location: [1282](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09RND933D&location=1282) ^ref-8501

responses. Both old and new learnings continue to exist in memory, so the old responses can still occur and an ongoing effort must be made to help the new responses predominate, though this is not always successful. — location: [1285](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09RND933D&location=1285) ^ref-934

---
contrast, although the range of applicability of the therapeutic reconsolidation process is very broad—in principle, covering all unwanted responses arising from emotional learning—there are several types of clinical situation in which its role should be, as a rule, only adjunctive to primary treatment through counteractive methods such as crisis intervention, skill-building, resource utilization, or pharmacological measures: situations of urgent crisis, danger or emergency conditions known not to consist of underlying emotional learnings (such as autism spectrum disorders, hypothyroidism-induced depression and genetically based addiction) individuals whose stability could be compromised by direct experience of underlying, unresolved emotional vulnerability or distress, or who are unable to attend to and maintain awareness of the content of their own subjective experiencing severe patterns of personality or character that initially make deeper emotional work and self-awareness impossible for all practical purposes — location: [1300](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09RND933D&location=1300) ^ref-44622

---
clients who express a definite choice not to do in-depth work and want to cultivate preferred states or behaviors without addressing interior, underlying sources of the problem. — location: [1308](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09RND933D&location=1308) ^ref-20901

---
A client’s emotional experience during a session may feel tolerable due to feeling sensitively accompanied by the therapist, but being alone with the experience after the session may feel daunting. When a client indicates that such a dilemma looms, the difficulty can reliably be dispelled by the therapist saying, “I understand, and what I want to suggest is for you to forget all about these things between sessions, and only when we are together during sessions will we revisit them. How would that be, for you?” With such permission to re-suppress what was retrieved in the session, all clients to whom we have offered that option have been fully successful at utilizing it. — location: [1643](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09RND933D&location=1643) ^ref-16505

of integration experiences, which are simply repeated experiences of the discovered material both during and between sessions. Stable integration into everyday awareness completes the retrieval of a symptom-requiring schema from implicit memory into explicit awareness (Step B of the therapeutic reconsolidation process). — location: [1652](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09RND933D&location=1652) ^ref-47359

---
Perhaps most importantly, the deep retrieval work in Coherence Therapy requires the therapist to refrain from following any counteractive reflex—the urge to apply immediately all possible influence against the newly found pro-symptom schema to correct it, refute it, fix it, override it, avoid it, disconnect from it, or manage it, believing that this could yield lasting change. — location: [1697](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09RND933D&location=1697) ^ref-27113

---
The therapist guides the client simply to stay in touch with, and keep having experiences of, the symptom-requiring emotional truth, embracing and integrating the schema into conscious awareness just as it is. — location: [1702](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09RND933D&location=1702) ^ref-17188

On a pocket-sized index card, the therapist wrote the same sentence that Richard had spoken as an overt statement: — location: [1707](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09RND933D&location=1707) ^ref-15623

level.” Use of an index card to guide a between-session task that maintains or even forwards the work is standard practice at the end of every session. — location: [1711](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09RND933D&location=1711) ^ref-28903

2007), the client’s mental model operates as a multi-component whole, so integration of a pro-symptom schema or position is not complete, as a rule, until all of its components have been experienced emotionally and, while being experienced, verbalized accurately by the client, and then incorporated into everyday awareness. — location: [1772](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09RND933D&location=1772) ^ref-58823

---
Every pro-symptom schema contains constructs that define a dire problem—a specific suffering that is urgent to avoid—and constructs that define the client’s solution to that problem—a certain strategy and tactics that are compellingly necessary and purposeful for avoiding that suffering. — location: [2090](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09RND933D&location=2090) ^ref-34037

---
The construct selected as the target for dissolution can be in either the problem-defining or solution-defining part of the symptom-necessitating schema. — location: [2097](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09RND933D&location=2097) ^ref-35758

---
If you were the therapist and you had now become acquainted with that schema, you could then recognize that its problem-defining constructs are these: I’ll be just like Dad, a know-it-all lording it over everyone, if I say anything that I’m confident is right. And then people will hate me for that, just the way I hate him for it. You would also recognize that the schema’s solution-defining constructs are these: I’d better keep myself quiet by thinking, “What do I know?” That includes a construct defining a general strategy for solving the problem (I’d better keep myself quiet) and a construct defining a concrete tactic for carrying out that strategy (by thinking, “What do I know?”). — location: [2106](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09RND933D&location=2106) ^ref-18662

---
You can also see that in the solution-defining cluster there is a tacit construct that could be verbalized as: By solving the problem in this way, I’ll be much better off. This construct is always present implicitly in any solution-defining cluster, though it is easy to overlook. — location: [2111](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09RND933D&location=2111) ^ref-49453

---
that, ask yourself the following question as you review the constructs in each cluster separately: “Which construct do the other constructs arise from as the basis for their very existence?” — location: [2116](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09RND933D&location=2116) ^ref-32229
