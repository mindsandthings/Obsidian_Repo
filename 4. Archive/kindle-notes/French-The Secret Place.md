## Highlights
Time isn’t. Grown-ups hammer down all these markers, bells schedules coffee-breaks, to stake down time so you’ll start believing it’s something small and mean, something that scrapes flake after flake off of everything you love till there’s nothing left; to stake you down so you won’t lift off and fly away, somersaulting through whirlpools of months, skimming through eddies of glittering seconds, pouring handfuls of hours over your upturned face. — location: [3012](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00IOE4JXS&location=3012) ^ref-12992

The dot tattoos are for that: signposts, in case she needs them someday, to guide her home. — location: [3019](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00IOE4JXS&location=3019) ^ref-7883
