## Highlights
Linguists are interested in the subconscious patterns behind the language we produce every day. But traditionally, linguistics doesn’t analyze writing very much, unless it’s a question about the history of a language and written records are all we have. The problem is that writing is too premeditated, too likely to have gotten filtered through multiple hands, too hard to attribute to a single person’s linguistic intuitions at a specific moment. But internet writing is different. It’s unedited, it’s unfiltered, and it’s so beautifully mundane. — location: [143](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=143) ^ref-28547

parts of language that we don’t even know we’re so good at, the patterns that emerge spontaneously, when we aren’t really thinking about them. — location: [175](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=175) ^ref-6247

worn down to “I don’t know,” “I dunno,” and even a simple triplet “uh-huh-uh” or “mm-hm-mm” to the low-high-low melody of “I dunno.” “I dunno” is easier to articulate than “I do not know,” but it’s not really much shorter to write (even though we sometimes write it to evoke speech). The melodic triple hum is exceedingly easy to produce (you can even do it with a mouthful of sandwich) — location: [233](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=233) ^ref-64811

the most commonly used sets of emoji are the faces and hands, like the smile, the face with tears of joy, the thumbs up, and the crossed fingers. We use emoji less to describe the world around us, and more to be fully ourselves in an online world. We do the same with gifs.

linguists have devised several methods for getting at more natural-sounding speech. One is to ask open-ended questions (“Could you describe your family?” rather than “How do you pronounce ‘aunt’?”). Another is to ask about an exciting or emotional event, to get people thinking about the content rather than the words (a popular, though perhaps rather morbid, question is “Can you tell me about a time you thought you might die?”). — location: [378](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=378) ^ref-25989

For rising words that are primarily written, not spoken—abbreviations like “tfti” (thanks for the information), “lls” (laughing like shit), and “ctfu” (cracking the fuck up) and phonetic spellings like “inna” (in a / in the) and “ard” (alright)—the number of times people saw them mattered a lot. Every additional exposure made someone twice as likely to start using them. The study pointed out that people encounter spoken slang both online and offline, so when we’re only measuring exposure via Twitter, we miss half or more of the exposures and the trend looks murky. But people mostly encounter the written slang online, so pretty much all of those exposures become measurable for a Twitter study. The researchers also found that you’re more likely to start using a new word from Friendy McNetwork, who shares a lot of mutual friends with you, and less likely to pick it up from Rando McRandomFace, who doesn’t share any of your friends, even if you and Rando follow each other just like you and Friendy do. — location: [510](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=510) ^ref-45728

terms tended to leapfrog from one city to another based on demographic similarity, not just geographic proximity. So slang would spread between Washington, D.C., and New Orleans (both have high proportions of black people), Los Angeles and Miami (high proportions of Hispanic people), or Boston and Seattle (high proportions of white people), but not necessarily the cities in between. For example, the abbreviation “af” for “as fuck” (as in “word maps are cool af”) starts out at low levels in Los Angeles and Miami in 2009, then spreads elsewhere in California, the South, and around Chicago in 2011–2012, suggesting that it was spreading from Hispanic to African American populations. The study stops there, but we can continue: in 2014 and 2015, “af” started appearing in BuzzFeed headlines, a decent measure of when it came to be co-opted by mainstream brands capitalizing on its association with African American coolness. — location: [519](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=519) ^ref-25781

Chambers figured that children learn “zee” from the alphabet song and American children’s television programs like Sesame Street, but when they get older, they learn that “zed” is associated with Canadian identity and switch.

We could almost feel sorry for the depths of self-loathing that these grammarians must have felt, to be so determined to replace their own language’s forms with that of another, — location: [723](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=723) ^ref-28167

If a writing handbook like Lowth’s or Strunk and White’s displeases you, you can throw it across the room or leave it to gather dust, but when you want to type a word that’s not in a predictive text model, you’ll fight for every letter. — location: [730](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=730) ^ref-19958

But spellchecks have tried to prevent people from spelling the same word differently within the same document by enforcing “organise” and “realise” all the time when set to British English, leading to an upswing in -ise endings among the general British typing public and the perception that -ize is only for Americans. — location: [749](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=749) ^ref-56504

Google Docs, where this book was written, has a spellcheck that draws on internet data, sometimes with surprising results. Once, to my great joy, it proffered a more common spelling of “Ronbledore” (an obscure Harry Potter fan theory that Ron Weasley is actually a time-traveling Dumbledore). — location: [789](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=789) ^ref-17432

What’s important about Arabizi is that it assumes familiarity with Arabic already: it’s a grassroots system based on the priorities of literate native speakers that each of these different sounds should be represented by a distinct symbol. Other Romanizations tend to do the opposite, rendering the same letters as variants of “d” and “s,” “dh” and “t,” “gh” and a backwards apostrophe (or simply omitting it altogether, as in the word “Arabic” itself, which is technically “3arabi”), based on what they sound like to non–Arabic speakers. Sure, sometimes it’s useful to be able to interact on a more globalized level, like when writing about names and locations in Arabic-speaking countries for an English-language newspaper, but sometimes you also care about the local. To Arabic speakers, these distinctions are completely vital, and omitting them is like trying to convince English speakers to spell “sing” and “thing” the same way because French doesn’t care about that weird English “th” sound. — location: [846](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=846) ^ref-4380

These tools are trained on large corpora, often from formal sources like books, newspapers, and radio, which are biased towards the forms of language that are already well documented. One method of bridging this gap uses public social media writing itself as training input—a promising avenue, considering that the quantity of informal writing produced on the internet exceeds the volume of formal writing many times over. — location: [901](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=901) ^ref-32415

No one who writes “u” does it because they’re unaware that “you” is an option. A literacy study by Michelle Drouin and Claire Davis points out that the idea that textisms might interfere with our ability to produce the formal standard just doesn’t fit with what we know about how memory works. Slang and abbreviations are for very common words: “u” for “you,” “ur” for “your,” “idk” or “dunno” for “I don’t know,” and so on. That’s the point—the sender saves a bit of effort, and the receiver can interpret them because they’re so frequent. We don’t get internet abbreviations for longer, rarer words and phrases, like “pterodactyl” or “do you wanna start a band?” — location: [913](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=913) ^ref-21489

the fact that teens deploy this mix of formal and informal styles in writing suggests that what they’re doing is neither an imperfect transcript of casual speech nor a failed attempt at formal writing. Internet writing is a distinct genre with its own goals, — location: [947](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=947) ^ref-23710

A paper analyzing the effects of spellcheck on writer’s block suggests that I may be onto something: instantly appearing red squiggles may seem helpful, but for complex documents, they pull writers away from the overall flow and make them think about small details too early. I’m also not alone in noticing positive effects from social media on my writing style: Twitter users in particular often note that the character limits and instant, utterance-level feedback of the tweet format have forced them to learn how to structure their thoughts — location: [965](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=965) ^ref-7606

But if you get a big enough group of people moving into the same region at the same time, they can alter the local dialect. The vowels of Raleigh, North Carolina, became less Southern after a wave of tech workers from Northern states started arriving in the 1960s, and Cockney has been replaced in working-class central London by Multicultural London English, which draws on a mix of Cockney, Afro-Caribbean English, Indian English, Nigerian English, and Bangladeshi English, especially since many Cockneys moved out to the suburbs after the Second World War. — location: [1009](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=1009) ^ref-60729

The exact time and date when “lol” was created may be forever lost to cyberspace, but Pearson’s account does fit the facts we can verify. The first known citation for LOL appears in a list of already common internet acronyms in an online newsletter called FidoNews from May 1989, as spotted by the linguist Ben Zimmer. Regardless, Pearson’s story evokes the era of Old Internet People: an internet friend, a long-standing pseudonym, laughter at the computer, the bafflement of non-techy family members. Once the next wave of internet users arrived, people would become a lot less surprised that friends and funny stuff happened online. — location: [1151](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=1151) ^ref-15358

The first generation of internet users had brought with them a certain smugness, a feeling of internet exceptionalism, the conviction that Internet People were better than regular people, and that it was just as well if the internet was a place where the previous norms of social interaction need not apply. If the language was a bit rough around the edges, prone to misinterpretations, so much the better for keeping out those who didn’t get it. The first generation to join the social internet en masse had a different motivation: to maintain friendships with a local community, rather than join a global one. They weren’t trying to reinvent communication; they were just trying to get on with living, to have the normal flirtations and breakups and crises using the communication tools available. But by using informal writing to convey the regular dramas of human life, they also started reshaping informal writing into something that could more deeply convey the full range of human emotions. — location: [1246](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=1246) ^ref-19024

Semi Internet People tend to be very good at email, and often follow top-notch early email etiquette, involving a large, complicated folder system, interspersing replies to a long email after the bits that are being replied to, and sometimes even changing the subject line as the topic of the email changes. (Some Old Internet People do this, too; Full Internet People tend to be horrified by it, as it messes up the later, Gmail-style technology that automatically threads emails by subject line and hides repeated blocks of text.) — location: [1361](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=1361) ^ref-38068

Semi Internet People’s early internet cultural touchstones consist more of funny chain emails than the crudely animated Flash videos of the Full Internet People. — location: [1364](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=1364) ^ref-36022

---
To Semi Internet People, the meaning of internet language is simply “this is a message I’m sending via the internet.” All meaning is face value meaning, and if you want to convey a more subtle layer of social meaning, that’s what a voice conversation is for. Their assumption is that text is fundamentally incapable of conveying the full social landscape. This is the exact opposite of what Full Internet People believe. — location: [1369](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=1369) ^ref-7180

Kids are all getting online at the same young age, socializing there as preteens or early teenagers, the same age when their peer groups start to take on an outsize importance in their lives offline. So for future generations, the same demographics that have always influenced language—age, gender, race, class, networks, and so on—will become more important than when you first went online. An easy way to identify both cohorts — location: [1397](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=1397) ^ref-24304

This cohort may not have the same linguistic norms online as Internet People proper, but that doesn’t mean that they’re typing in newspaper-ready formal English any more than anyone else is online. By nature, these are the kind of internet residents that you can’t reach with a large internet survey, but the most common piece of linguistic anecdata that I kept seeing myself and hearing about from other Internet People concerns their use of separation characters. Many people in this group use hyphens or strings of periods or commas to separate one thought from the next (“i just had to beat 2 danish guys at ping poong.....& ..they were good....glad i havent lost my chops” or “thank you all for the birthday wishes - great to hear from so many old friends - hope you all are doing well -- had a lovely dinner” or “Happy Anniversary,,,Wishing you many more years of happiness together,,,,”). We don’t have statistics about the exact prevalence, but the dash or ellipsis as generic separation character seems to be found throughout, at least, the English-speaking world. When I asked for more anecdotes on Twitter, someone commented, “So you’ve texted with my in-laws?” Why do all these people, who primarily went online to reach younger — location: [1443](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=1443) ^ref-49329

A corpus study of over five hundred Swiss postcards from the 1950s to the 2010s notes two common features of the genre: repeated punctuation marks, like . . . . . . . ???, and !!!, as well as smiley faces, hearts, and other emoticon-like doodles. Indeed, this influence goes in both directions: a study comparing the postcards and text messages of Finnish teenagers in 2003 noted that they had begun writing sideways emoticon faces like :) in their postcards. — location: [1470](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=1470) ^ref-8634

Postcards and recipe cards have a couple key features in common with social media posts. They’re both written by a single person, without editing—not like a published cookbook or a novel told in letters. Both provide a constrained space to write in, which encourages a certain breeziness, and both are often semipublic: directed at a specific person or two but implicitly viewable by a much larger group. It’s not an invasion of privacy to pick up and read a postcard or recipe card lying on a table the way it would be to unfold and read a letter addressed to someone else. These similarities explain both the generic separation characters as well as the surprisingly rapid adoption of emoji by older groups in comparison to internet acronyms like “lol.” Pre Internet People (along with some Semi and Old Internet People who also use the dot dot dot, though not quite as extensively) are faithfully reproducing the conventions of a genre that they’re fluent in but that their baffled younger audience has lost in our digital age. This genre already contained a mental “slot” for little doodles, and emoji fit right in. This group provides an intriguing bridge between digital and analogue informal writing: even people who are almost completely at sea with the technical side of things have correctly identified the social framework and mapped it onto familiar linguistic practices. In many ways, this oldest internet cohort — location: [1480](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=1480) ^ref-21654

Practically speaking, the bright line question that divides Full and Post Internet People is often, did you get Facebook before or after your parents? Or in more general terms, did you arrive on the social internet after it was already ubiquitous, or were you on it when it was still a niche or young-person — location: [1507](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=1507) ^ref-287

But it’s important to be cautious about any attempt at Divination By Teenager.

As the linguist and internet researcher Susan Herring points out, her generation of baby boomer teens hung out “aimlessly” in malls, at drive-in movies, at sock hops and school sports games and public parks. They created codes and wrote backwards to pass notes, the same way kids in internet generations create inventive language for texting, and they decorated their lockers or bedrooms like a younger generation takes great care with their social media profiles. Whether they’re spending hours on the landline telephone, racking up a massive texting bill, or being “addicted” to Facebook or MySpace or Instagram, something that teens want to do in every generation is spend a lot of unstructured time hanging out, flirting, and jockeying for status with their peers. — location: [1530](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=1530) ^ref-64939

Studies consistently show that most teens would rather hang out with their friends in person. The reasons are telling: teens prefer offline interaction because it’s “more fun” and you “can understand what people mean better.” But suburban isolation, the hostility of malls and other public places to groups of loitering teenagers, and schedules packed with extracurriculars make these in-person hangouts difficult, so instead teens turn to whatever social site or app contains their friends (and not their parents). As danah boyd puts it, “Most teens aren’t addicted to social media; if anything, they’re addicted to each other.” — location: [1540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=1540) ^ref-56399

---
“context collapse.” This is danah boyd’s term for when people from all your overlapping friend groups see all your shared posts from different aspects of your life. For adults who occasionally see a coworker’s personal photos or political updates, context collapse is a fairly minor issue, a problem of specific individuals being indiscreet. For young people, context collapse is a collective problem: they need space to figure out who they are, where they aren’t being constantly supervised by authority figures. — location: [1552](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=1552) ^ref-18614

a more durable strategy, organized along three principles. First, things should disappear more, the way conversations throughout history have naturally not left records. Private messages that vanish after they’re seen, live video streaming, manual deletion of old posts, and story-style posts that only stay visible for twenty-four hours all reduce the likelihood that messages will be encountered outside their intended context. Second, not all social networks need to be all things to all people. Rather than using a single dominant social platform, or maintaining an account on every single one, you pick and choose your platforms to help control your contexts, perhaps interacting with school friends on Instagram and fandom friends on Twitter, or doing more résumé-safe activities with a public account under your real name but putting more private activities into a locked or pseudonymous account. Finally, social groups also need to be organized at levels more fluid and granular than an entire platform, including both large, open options like hashtags and public groups, and small, closed options like groupchats or secret groups. — location: [1560](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=1560) ^ref-59592

“I love you” is already maximally warm and fuzzy, so if you add a second layer of meaning to it, things can only get worse. — location: [1590](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=1590) ^ref-54658

But the addition of all caps for tone of voice didn’t eliminate the official kind of capitals, which remain common on EXIT signs and CAUTION tape and CHAPTER ONE headings: they may be emphatic, but they aren’t interpreted as especially loud. Rather, our interpretation seems to flip depending on whether we read the text as formal or informal: HOME in a website’s menu bar is a mere graphic design choice, while HOME in a message like “ugh I want to go HOME” is typographical tone of voice. — — location: [1763](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=1763) ^ref-9343

What’s cool about expressive lengthening is that, although it started as a very literal representation of longer sounds, it’s ended up creating a form of emotional expression that now has no possible spoken equivalent, making it more akin to its typographical cousins, all caps and italics. — location: [1799](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=1799) ^ref-39784

“You might have used this word seriously here, but I know you wouldn’t use it excitedly. And yet you’ve added sparkles anyway, and they’re definitely not a serious thing.

I did an informal poll on Twitter in 2016, asking, “When you write on your phone, do you ever undo the autocapitalization for the sake of aesthetic?” and the results were very clear: of the five hundred–plus people who replied, over half said that they do so all the time, with another third saying “sometimes” and only 14 percent saying “never.” Several people, unprompted, even commented that they’d gone into their phone settings and turned off autocapitalization permanently—a far cry from the “lazy” stereotype of the pre-2006 lowercaser. In the words of Dolly Parton, “It costs a lot of money to look this cheap.” — location: [2102](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=2102) ^ref-20459

---
If polite typography, as we saw earlier, is about making extra effort, using initial capitals and friendly exclamation marks to signal cheerful distance or genuine enthusiasm, then ironic typography is the opposite on both counts: it introduces a note of dissonance that makes the reader look harder to find the double meaning. Any variation from an expected baseline will do, whether that’s lowercasing, sparkle sarcasm, asking a rhetorical question by omitting the question mark, or ironically using outdated slang (one much-reblogged post on Tumblr noted that saying something is “great” indicates that it’s genuinely good, whereas something that’s described as “gr8” is a guilty pleasure or appreciated sarcastically). But crucially, irony requires this baseline in the first place. It required us to develop a set of typographical resources for indicating straightforward types of voices, like shouting and enthusiasm, before we could creatively subvert them. — location: [2213](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=2213) ^ref-40933

It was the subversion of autocapitalization, after all, that paved the way for ironic minimalism, and the subversion of traditional handwritten means of calling attention that paved the way for #E m p h a s i s™. For typographical tone of voice, training on formal datasets from books and newspapers is not going to be enough. This kind of subtlety must be part of the future of any system that aims to facilitate writing, and it’s not yet clear how to do so effectively: IBM experimented with adding Urban Dictionary data to its artificial intelligence system Watson, only to scrub it all out again when the computer started swearing at them. — location: [2249](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=2249) ^ref-50874

emoji don’t just have one function, they have a range of them. But crucially, it’s the same range that gestures have, and that’s why emoji caught on so quickly and so completely: because they gave us an easy way of representing the functions behind the gestures that are so important for our informal communication. Without realizing that either gestures or emoji were potentially systematic, a couple billion internet users had subconsciously, collectively, and spontaneously mapped the functions of the one onto the capacity of the other. — location: [2367](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=2367) ^ref-29183

Emblem gestures can all fit easily into a linguistic frame (try any of them in a sentence like “If we’re late, then ___”), but they’re also perfectly meaningful without speech at all. The same thing goes for many emoji (you can say “If we’re late, then ” or “If we’re late, then ”), but it’s also sufficient sometimes to reply with just a thumbs up or eye-rolling emoji. — location: [2382](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=2382) ^ref-41169

Emblem gestures have precise forms and stable meanings. They may seem universal because they often cover different territories than languages do: the middle finger, or digitus impudicus, was also considered rude in ancient Greece and Rome, while the palm-inwards V sign means “up yours” in some English-speaking nations but not others. But ultimately, emblems are arbitrary and culturally specific: obscene emblems from around the world include thumbs up (“sit on this” in many — location: [2385](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=2385) ^ref-60359

People were bothered by variation in the form of the dancer emoji because it was serving as an emblem, and emblems add their own separate meaning to the words they go with. But people were unruffled by variation in the form of the birthday cake emoji because it’s an illustration, and illustrative emoji instead highlight and reinforce a topic that’s already present. It’s okay if illustrators aren’t quite exactly on target: the surrounding words will provide enough context to interpret them correctly. For the emblem emoji, we tend to know exactly what we’re looking for because we’ve seen other people using it first. For illustrative emoji, we often go browsing through our keyboards instead. — location: [2466](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=2466) ^ref-57212

Looking at the top two hundred sequences of each length, about half were pure repetition, such as two tears of joy emoji , three loudly sobbing emoji , or four red heart emoji . Those that weren’t simple repetition were often complex repetition, such as snow around a snowman , the see-no-evil, hear-no-evil, speak-no-evil monkeys , and kiss faces with kiss marks . Even the most heterogeneous strings of emoji were always thematically similar, such as heart eyes and kiss face or single tear and loudly crying , strings of related objects like birthday or fast food , and strings of hearts in different colors or sizes such as . Emoji aren’t behaving like words in this respect: there are no repetitions at all in the top two hundred sequences of two, three, and four words in the Corpus of Contemporary American English.

Sending someone all of the possible birthday party emoji is extra festive: great! But sending someone all of the possible phallic emoji (say, the eggplant and the cucumber and the corncob and the banana ) is NOT extra sexxaayy: that’s a weird salad. There are multiple kinds of gestures and multiple kinds of emoji. Paying attention to how emoji fit with each other can give us a renewed appreciation for the gestures we make every day. — location: [2570](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=2570) ^ref-54492

The emphasis on the eyes was important for kaomoji because of a broader cultural difference in how emotions are represented. When researchers show East Asian and Western Caucasian people photos of faces displaying different emotions, the Asian participants tend to make conclusions about the emotions based on what people are doing with their eyes, whereas the Western participants look to the mouth to read emotions. — location: [2656](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=2656) ^ref-57359

gesture linguist Adam Kendon has also invoked Austin’s idea of clarifying the intentions behind an utterance as a way of explaining what emblems do in communication. Think about saying “Good job!” along with a nameable, emblematic gesture: with a thumbs up, it’s a congratulations; with a wink, it’s a sly prod; with a facepalm, it’s a sarcastic acknowledgment of failure; with the middle finger, it’s an insult. — location: [2778](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=2778) ^ref-16412

emoticons become a positive, helpful, social behavior, a way of saying, “I want to clarify my true intentions for you.” It’s not the more negative behavior of putting on a mask. It’s true that a smiley face doesn’t always mean that the speaker is happy (an uncontrollable, genuine smile), but it does align with a deliberate, social smile, or the exclamation mark that proves you’re not a Stone-Hearted Ice Witch. — location: [2784](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=2784) ^ref-36890

Emoji didn’t succeed because they were a language, they succeeded because they’re not a language. Rather than try to compete with words on their home turf, emoji added in a whole new system to represent a whole other layer of meaning. We already had a way of representing individual sounds, in the form of letters, and we’ve been developing the system for representing tone of voice using our existing punctuation and capitalization that we talked about in the previous chapter. So emoji and other pictorial elements are filling the third important pillar of communication: a way of representing our gestures and physical space. — location: [2844](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=2844) ^ref-33400

a court interpreted a smiley emoticon in one context as indicating that something was a joke, not to be taken seriously as evidence, while another court interpreted a smiley emoticon in a different context as merely a symbol of happiness. In a list of emoji examples from court cases compiled by US criminal justice news organization The Marshall Project, emoji are often treated as a clue regarding the intent of the writer, such as whether a gun emoji can indicate a genuine threat, whether a face with tongue stuck out emoji is enough to indicate that a violent post is a joke, or whether sharing a violent video with smile and heart emoji indicates a “twisted delight” in it. — location: [2874](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=2874) ^ref-22187

for any type of conversation, people are doing it because it meets a need for them. It might not be a need we remember. It might not be a need we have ourselves. It might not be a need we want to acknowledge. But often, it’s a need that we can learn to understand if we start looking for it. When we try to understand the needs that now obsolete communications technologies were meeting, it can help us understand the different stakes of the present. It’s too hard to start with current battlegrounds, with questions about the correct email salutation or whether it’s rude to answer a text when you’re talking with someone else. We’ve already chosen our sides on those issues. But if we can look at the obsolete controversies of the past, seek to understand what people were aiming for, and realize that the uproar about them seems faintly ridiculous in hindsight, perhaps we can view the controversies of the present with a more compassionate lens. Perhaps we can marvel at how interesting — location: [2934](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=2934) ^ref-10397

as recently as 1960, researchers for the Dictionary of American Regional English found just 60 people who would greet someone they knew well with “hey”—in comparison to 683 who’d say “hi” and 169 who’d say “howdy”—and most of those 60 were in a single region, the South and Lower Mississippi Valley.

conversation analysts find that actually we don’t pause much, any more than we normally pause between each word. If I ask you a question and you don’t start answering immediately, I’ll probably treat it as a break in communication.

a 1992 survey found that the overwhelming majority of people would answer a ringing telephone even during a serious argument with their spouse.

Picking up a videocall out of the blue was simply too awkward to contemplate. But since every videochat program includes a text messaging feature, you can plan a videochat before committing to one (“hey, you ready to skype?” “just give me 2 min”) and this awkwardness vanishes: you have the option to decline via text where no one can see you, or a minute to scramble into a decent-looking shirt. Paradoxically, having access to the lesser intrusiveness of chat conversations makes it easier to have higher-bandwidth conversations in video. — location: [3245](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=3245) ^ref-57422

Using macros to make it easier to post images had an insider/outsider dynamic from the very beginning: according to a history of the forum, its moderator had created the image macro feature to prove a point about how annoying repetitive images were.

Kate Miltner documented this split among two kinds of lolcat fans in the late 2000s. Self-described MemeGeeks had liked the early kind of lolcats on 4chan but had moved on to other memes, like Advice Animals, as lolcats became more popular and easier to create. Self-described Cheezfriends, on the other hand, tended to reside on the site I Can Has Cheezburger and demonstrated their community membership through fluency in the stylized lolspeak itself, rather than technical prowess creating the memes. At peak lolcat, posters on the lolcat forums at I Can Has Cheezburger would type entire messages to each other in lolspeak, and it was easy for them to linguistically tell apart the newbs from the true Cheezfriends, even without any cat images to help. — location: [3554](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076GNS3J4&location=3554) ^ref-5586
