## Highlights
For clarity and consistency, US utility companies rely on Uniform Color Codes developed by the American Public Works Association when mapping out subterranean utilities on surfaces above. On city streets today, you can see the spectrum of safety colors that have been formalized and revised over the decades by the American National Standards Institute: RED: electric power lines, cables, and conduit ORANGE: telecommunications, alarm and signal lines YELLOW: gaseous or combustive materials including natural gas, oil, petroleum, and steam GREEN: sewers and drain lines BLUE: potable water PURPLE: reclaimed water, irrigation, or slurry lines PINK: temporary markings, unidentified facilities, or known unknowns WHITE: proposed excavation areas, limits, or routes — location: [164](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086YHKSJX&location=164) ^ref-7318

One of the ways to get robust posts to break properly is called a “slip base” system. Instead of using a single continuous post, a slip base approach joins two separate posts close to ground level using a connector plate. This joint allows the pair to break apart at an intended juncture. It works basically like this: a lower post is put in the ground, then an upper post is attached to it using breakaway bolts. These bolts are made to fracture or dislodge when the post gets hit hard enough, so the upper post gets knocked over while the lower post passes safely under the moving vehicle. When everything works as designed, such posts can also help slow down a vehicle and minimize damage. Subsequent infrastructure repair becomes easier as well—in many cases, a new upper post can simply be bolted onto the undamaged base post below it, which requires less material and work. The critical plate-to-plate connections underpinning slip systems can be obvious to the naked eye or tucked away under plate covers. The connector plates of inclined slip bases take this basic engineering design a step further by being tilted at an angle relative to the ground and optimized for hits from an assumed direction of impact. Instead of simply sheering sideways, posts are actually launched up into the air on impact, ideally landing behind the car that hit them. In slow-motion crash test videos, signs arc up, twirl overhead, then land on the road surface once the vehicle has passed beneath it. The downside is that if the post is hit from an unexpected direction it might not break away at all. — location: [247](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086YHKSJX&location=247) ^ref-64165

Straight or angled slip bases can work in isolation, but they can also be paired with hinged upper connections that help preserve infrastructure and save lives. The telephone lines running along the tops of utility poles can in some cases help hold up a pole even if a vehicle crashes into it. Instead of falling over (potentially onto a vehicle or into a lane of traffic), a telephone pole can be designed to break off at its base and then swing up and out of the way before coming to a stop and hanging in place while the cables linking it to neighboring poles hold it up temporarily. — location: [259](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086YHKSJX&location=259) ^ref-14673

critical. Knox Boxes offer a simple solution: when emergency personnel respond to a call and arrive on site, they use a master key or code to unlock a rapid entry access box and retrieve its contents. Inside a typical box is another key or code for accessing that specific building. So firefighters essentially have a skeleton key that opens all of the boxes in their area. With that one key, they can effectively gain entry to the huge array of buildings they are charged to protect, including apartments, stores, office complexes, art museums, and more. — location: [276](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086YHKSJX&location=276) ^ref-16727

From a security perspective, these access boxes may sound like a perfect opportunity for a burglar to go on a robbery spree, but building owners and key users are aware of the risks and take precautions. Some building managers also tie their boxes to larger security alarm systems that will trigger when anyone accesses them. As for the master keys that open the boxes, some fire departments employ tracking functionality to avoid losing them or letting them fall into the wrong hands. — location: [286](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086YHKSJX&location=286) ^ref-45578

The idea of using a grand monument to ventilate a sewer may seem strange, but the city’s sewage system was a new technology for Australia at the time. On the functional side, engineers had developed two basic types of sewer vents—educt and induct. The induct drew in air while the educt allowed lighter gases back out. Pressure, odor, and disease had to be addressed in the system, so they were addressed in style, starting with the Hyde Park Obelisk’s eductive design. The resulting obelisk is both infrastructure and landmark. Since its erection, the obelisk has been the subject of several modifications and repairs, but it has mostly been preserved in its original form. — location: [313](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086YHKSJX&location=313) ^ref-47208

The Sydney obelisk, meanwhile, is still in use today, though its function has shifted slightly. It is now used as a vent for stormwater runoff rather than the smelly city sewer system. — location: [320](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086YHKSJX&location=320) ^ref-46864

A tradition was born of this tragedy: local couples began to etch their names onto padlocks, attach them to the bridge, and throw the key into the water, a symbolic and public act sealing their commitment to each other. — location: [580](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086YHKSJX&location=580) ^ref-61616

In some cities, love locks are considered vandalism, and if lovers are caught affixing them, they may be greeted with a fine. In other places, locks are actively encouraged with structures specially built to support them. — location: [590](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086YHKSJX&location=590) ^ref-30555

Taxation changes from one government to the next, but in many cases, the impacts of old taxes can linger for centuries, subtly embedded in built environments. — location: [2214](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086YHKSJX&location=2214) ^ref-5236

The logic behind this tax was simple: the more windows a building had, the more people paid. In response, citizens ended up boarding or bricking up a lot of windows in rooms deemed less important. Some remain that way to this day despite the eventual repeal of the tax. — location: [2224](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086YHKSJX&location=2224) ^ref-52469

many Dutch buildings were built thin, tall, and long to minimize tax obligations for their owners. In turn, this typology necessitated narrower staircases, which led to exterior hoist systems for moving furniture and goods into and out of upper floors. These old hooks and hoist wheels still hang off the front of many structures to this day. — location: [2232](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086YHKSJX&location=2232) ^ref-15961

A key strategy for keeping this structure stable is a tuned mass damper, which is essentially a counterweight against the winds, but unlike most dampers, this one also serves as a core aspect of the building’s identity. In some towers, the tuned mass damper is a weight on rollers; in others, it is a block of concrete suspended in a pool of liquid. In Taipei 101, it is a gigantic pendulum that slows the sway of the structure. A number of tall thin skyscrapers have dampers of some sort, but they are usually hidden behind closed doors on locked upper floors. In Taipei 101, the enormous damper — location: [2445](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086YHKSJX&location=2445) ^ref-47118

Names for routes all have regional variations and exceptions, but there are fairly persistent conventions even longtime drivers may not realize. ROAD (Rd): any route connecting two points STREET (St): has buildings on both sides, perpendicular to avenues AVENUE (Ave): perpendicular to streets, may have trees on one side BOULEVARD (Blvd): wide city street with median and side vegetation WAY (Way): small side route LANE (La): narrow and often rural DRIVE (Dr): long, winding, and shaped by natural environments TERRACE (Ter): wraps up and around a slope PLACE (Pl): no through traffic or a dead end COURT (Ct): ends in a circle or loop (like a plaza or square) HIGHWAY (Hwy): major public route connecting larger cities FREEWAY (Fwy): has two or more lanes in each direction EXPRESSWAY (Expy): divided highway for faster traffic INTERSTATE (I): often goes between states but not always TURNPIKE (Tpke): usually an expressway with a tollbooth BELTWAY (Bltwy): wraps around a city like a belt PARKWAY (Pkwy): usually has parkland on the side CAUSEWAY (Cswy): runs on an embankment across water or a wetland — location: [3323](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086YHKSJX&location=3323) ^ref-41162
