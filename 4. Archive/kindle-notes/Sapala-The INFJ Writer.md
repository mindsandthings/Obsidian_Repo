## Highlights
The intuition we receive is a diamond with a number of different sparkling sides, but our tangible reality only allows us to describe one side at a time. The side you choose to describe is your story. That’s why no matter how hard you try, you’ll never be able to get the whole diamond down on the page. — location: [378](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FG8TQIW&location=378) ^ref-27500

if the Sensitive Intuitive makes the shift to an updated belief system in which there are no victims, and the world gives people exactly what they asked for based on the choices they’ve made and the intention they’ve set, the quicksand instantly loses its power. Most Sensitive Intuitives resist moving into the new victim-less belief system because they assume they can’t take their empathy and compassion with them. Nothing could be further from the truth. When we shift into a mindset where there are no victims, we call even more strongly on our empathy and compassion, because when there are no victims there is no longer any blame. There are only choices. And anyone can make a different choice, no matter how small, as the first step forward in changing their lives. — location: [1327](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FG8TQIW&location=1327) ^ref-37036

Affirmations that work well are: I have unique gifts that the world needs. No one else can write my book. Life gave me my unique gifts for a reason. — location: [1482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FG8TQIW&location=1482) ^ref-25947

this is also why it’s so important for the INFJ and other Sensitive Intuitives to write for themselves before they even think about how their story will do in front of an audience. If a Sensitive Intuitive begins their writing project with the goal of writing a bestseller or writing to fit the criteria of an academic program, their motivation will fall to pieces within a short period of time. Soon it will be the most tedious of tasks to get the words out and they might find themselves losing any spark of enthusiasm for writing for longer periods of time. — location: [1978](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FG8TQIW&location=1978) ^ref-35797

The only way to get a Sensitive Intuitive to put their authentic effort into anything is to make sure they are intrinsically motivated. — location: [2001](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FG8TQIW&location=2001) ^ref-23250

To find out how you can improve your offer, ask yourself a few questions and be completely honest with your answers: Who in this world do you want to help? Why is your writing important to you? What kinds of issues have you dealt with in real life that show up in your writing? What lessons have you learned from your own struggles that you would love to share with others? What kind of person do you think your writing could speak to specifically, and what would it say? — location: [2049](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FG8TQIW&location=2049) ^ref-10274

Basically, an INFJ wants to live self-actualized in every moment, while acting as a catalyst to help everyone around them walk their own unique life path too. It’s a tall order. — location: [2094](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FG8TQIW&location=2094) ^ref-44626

The key to making this work at a writers’ conference is to use the same method that most INFJs unconsciously use in their own everyday lives. They only express authentic interest in the people who they are genuinely drawn to. The same holds true at a writers’ conference. There is no need to mingle with everyone in the room, or to tell every panelist that you found their ideas scintillating when you really didn’t. Instead, I urge Sensitive Intuitives to go to conferences with an open, curious mind, listen as much as they can, and then reach out to the people who said things or acted in ways that genuinely spoke to them. — location: [2102](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FG8TQIW&location=2102) ^ref-5887
