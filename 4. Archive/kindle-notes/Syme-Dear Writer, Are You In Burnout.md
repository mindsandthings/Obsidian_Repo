## Highlights
I highly recommend checking out the Bright Line Eating book (not to recommend the program, — location: [580](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X66MHDZ&location=580) ^ref-42276

This is what I call “questioning the premise.” It’s the art of listening for the assumptions that someone is making so we can decide if that person is going to align with us or not. — location: [985](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X66MHDZ&location=985) ^ref-19950

You are so wrapped up in listening to either their certainty or your fear of failure, you're not doing any kind of logical evaluation of whether you should or should not do the thing. — location: [993](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X66MHDZ&location=993) ^ref-56648

---
When you hear the word “just”, stop and ask yourself, “is that thing as easy for me as it is for them?” If the answer is no, then you’ve just questioned the premise. — location: [1002](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X66MHDZ&location=1002) ^ref-40337

When we take in all advice as equal, just because the person is a known name, or because our friend recommended them, then we’re not being discerning about whose advice we will follow. — location: [1011](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X66MHDZ&location=1011) ^ref-47991

Strategic quitting looks like: this isn’t going to be worth it in the long run, so I’m wasting my time trying to make it happen. — location: [1022](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X66MHDZ&location=1022) ^ref-31462

Of course, also remember, not all rest is created equal.  Sometimes, rest looks like taking a break from expecting words or ads to get done because you need to clean your house, or rearrange your office, or get a new car, or move.  Sometimes, rest looks like actually laying down and sleeping.  Sometimes rest means eating better so you can get better quality work time and sleep time.  Sometimes rest means reading books.  Sometimes rest means unfollowing newsletters, clearing internet tabs, closing accounts, hiding or unfriending people on Facebook, or putting an auto-responder on your email. It might even look like deleting email. Or taking your email off your website so you're not as reachable. — location: [1089](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X66MHDZ&location=1089) ^ref-56655

If you are highly driven, you might need to do a lot of small tasks that have been piling up and going undone so you could "do the more important writing work". All of that pile is creating cognitive dissonance, just sitting there undone. Take some time to address the pile. The “small wins” will help give you energy to build your ladder. — location: [1260](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X66MHDZ&location=1260) ^ref-58711

If you are highly curious and intelligent, go to libraries, go to museums, go to lectures, have new experiences, learn something new, immerse yourself in something that will excite you and bring you new ideas. Those energy pennies will be golden. Often, in the pit, we don’t want to “go out” and Netflix can be a comfort activity. Sometimes, Netflix is all you can handle. But as much as possible, try to get out of the Netflix environment and find a new environment. — location: [1275](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X66MHDZ&location=1275) ^ref-14010

If you are highly success-oriented, you have to surround yourself with people who reframe your self-confidence for you. Take yourself out of situations where you feel a lack of confidence. Put yourself into situations where you are reminded of how good you are and how what you're doing is right. Cut out the places that don't support this message. (And listen to me carefully here:) No. Matter. Where. They. Come. From. And. No. Matter. How. Hard. It. Will. Be. — location: [1284](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X66MHDZ&location=1284) ^ref-17617

Quick note to those of you who have taken the CliftonStrengths® assessment. There are special hacks to building ladder rungs when you know your Strengths. With any Strength, look at the list of qualities from your report. Those are the things that give you energy. Do those things. — location: [1299](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X66MHDZ&location=1299) ^ref-36455

Commit to one or two things that will bring you energy pennies. Many of us can’t handle much more than that. The inertia of our lives can’t take a complete overhaul. But if you limit the “make pennies” to one or two things, then you are more likely to be doing them in sixty days. — location: [1488](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X66MHDZ&location=1488) ^ref-35321

I did a six-part series of videos on burnout that may be more parts by the time you watch them, but here is the link to that playlist. I hope it’s helpful. — location: [1510](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X66MHDZ&location=1510) ^ref-42051
