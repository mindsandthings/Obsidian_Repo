## Highlights
Step Two: Fill in the Details That Still Require Research Look for places where knowing a detail wasn’t necessary during the first draft, but adding it now will make the scene richer and more plausible. Pick a day when you can focus, then start at the first missing detail and take them one at a time until they’re done. At the very least, write the information in another file so you can easily add it when you reach that scene during revision. — location: [116](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=116) ^ref-63327

---
Step Three: Finalize Any Shaky Character Backstories Odds are the main characters have decent backstories and histories (if not, you’ll deal with that in Workshop Two), but secondary characters—or characters who turned out to be more important than you originally thought—might not be as fleshed out as needed. Look at your characters and flesh out any missing histories or defining moments necessary to the plot. Now that the first draft is done, it should be clear who matters and who needs more oomph to refine their personalities or personal stories. You’ll also know what areas or details will add depth to the existing story and character arcs. — location: [120](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=120) ^ref-33144

---
Step Four: Decide on the Final Details or Names Sometimes you need to live with a name or detail a while before you decide if they’re working in the novel or not. And sometimes, you change them mid-novel and forget, so both versions (or spellings) exist. If you have any names or details you’re not sure about, change them now so you can get used to the new ones, and change them again if you still don’t like them. — location: [126](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=126) ^ref-34140

---
Step Five: Do What You Know Needs Doing If there’s anything you think is going to take additional time or effort, go ahead and do some work on it first. Maybe you know you’re not happy about the setting, or you wanted to add more symbolism, or you think the novel needs a subplot—whatever is nagging at you, give in and fix it. Filling the holes now will make the rest of the revision process easier. — location: [130](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=130) ^ref-17752

---
Get the plot the way you want it: Everyone in the story has the right goals and is generally doing what they need to do. Revising your plot is all about moving the pieces around so they're in the best possible places to achieve the strongest impact. For example, you might know you need a scene where the protagonist discovers her best friend betrayed her, but not know exactly where that scene best fits in the novel. — location: [149](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=149) ^ref-23585

---
Get the characters the way you want them: Characters change over the course of a novel, and not just in the story. You might start a character with one personality and end up changing it as the novel develops. Or you might decide two minor characters should be combined into one, or kill off a character altogether. Make sure you have the right story people in the right places. — location: [152](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=152) ^ref-64745

---
Middle Draft Revisions Once you’ve dealt with the macro issues, move on to the text itself. Middle draft revisions include issues that require rewriting on a smaller, scene-by-scene level. These edits don't change the plot or story, but clarify or enhance how the information is conveyed to your readers. In middle draft revisions you will: — location: [155](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=155) ^ref-64078

---
Flesh out or cut descriptions: — location: [158](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=158) ^ref-62323

---
Adjust the pacing and scene or chapter transitions: — location: [161](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=161) ^ref-52530

---
Replace weak words and phrases with strong ones: — location: [163](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=163) ^ref-44566

---
Delete chapters without a thought if they need to go; cut favorite lines if the scene changes and they no longer work. — location: [199](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=199) ^ref-52265

---
Revision Red Flag: If you find yourself changing the story as well as the plot, you might have a core conflict issue or story premise problem. It only becomes problematic if you're changing the plot and story so much, every revision reads like a whole new book. — location: [205](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=205) ^ref-31897

---
Think Macro Until You're Happy With the Story The big elements determine if a novel will work—the core conflicts, the character goals, the stakes, the premise. — location: [219](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=219) ^ref-30252

---
Trust Your Gut If you think something needs fixing, it probably does. If it nags at you that a certain character does a certain thing, go fix it before you put a ton of work into revising. — location: [222](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=222) ^ref-11822

---
Put the notes into the manuscript file: Copy all the comments you want to address directly into the manuscript, so as you read through each scene, — location: [251](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=251) ^ref-42742

---
Create a master revision file: A master file with a summary and list of what you want to revise can provide a nice, step-by-step guide to follow—and a checklist to cross off when each aspect is done. — location: [255](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=255) ^ref-19634

---
Revising From Feedback This is a draft that’s been through critiques and has feedback to help guide you in your revision. It might be a first draft or a later draft. The hard part here is figuring out what feedback to heed and what to ignore. For a more in-depth discussion on this revision type, see Revising From Feedback. — location: [285](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=285) ^ref-53051

---
Approach it as if You’re Doing a Critique for a Friend It can help to look at your manuscript and pretend it was written by a friend. What advice would you give that friend about this story? Take it a step further and pretend it’s a good friend who wants you to tell it like it is and not hold back. They won’t take anything you say personally. Then critique the manuscript to the best of your ability. Be a good friend and be ruthless. The tougher you are, the better the manuscript will be. — location: [319](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=319) ^ref-4748

---
Don’t Worry About the Time it Takes to Revise — location: [324](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=324) ^ref-14198

---
If you're not sure about a comment, think about what the critiquer is trying to point out and why: Think about why you're resistant to the comment. Sometimes feedback requires an edit that scares you, asks you to change something you love, or even needs a skill you're not sure you have to fix. Or it might suggest something you hadn't thought about before, but there's something in the comment that resonates with you and you hesitate. — location: [361](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=361) ^ref-11790

---
If you trust the critiquer had that issue, but know in your heart the scene or detail is right: Sometimes critiquers spot a problem and know something is off, but the trouble spot isn't where they see it—it's all in the setup, so the resolution isn't coming through correctly. — location: [365](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=365) ^ref-39445

---
If it's a clarity issue, fix it, even if you think it's clear: If a reader was confused, something wasn't clear. — location: [372](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=372) ^ref-42083

---
Decide what's needed in the story and what's not. What’s the single most important goal in the plot? That’s your core conflict. — location: [439](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=439) ^ref-60305

---
Who is the single most important character in the story (that's your protagonist)? Who is their antagonist? Now get rid of everyone else (don't panic, you'll add some back!). Make a list of all the other characters. Go through the list and ask if the two critical characters (protagonist and antagonist) absolutely totally need that person to resolve the story goal. It's — location: [448](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=448) ^ref-26623

---
look for anyone who brings a serious subplot with them. If their story risks overshadowing or hijacking the core conflict, they do not need to be there. — location: [453](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=453) ^ref-2832

---
What are the five critical events that have to happen to resolve the core conflict? Who are the five (or fewer) critical characters necessary to achieve those goals? — location: [456](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=456) ^ref-57225

---
To help fix out-of-order or repeated details, search for each character's name (or a key detail of backstory) and verify where you revealed it first, then check if it was also mentioned any other place. — location: [509](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=509) ^ref-8659

---
You need a little reminder as to why you wrote this novel in the first place, and who you wrote it for. — location: [533](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=533) ^ref-37966

---
Step Two: What Story Are You Telling? You have a core story about something that intrigues you as a writer, perhaps even a general theme. What core idea is at the heart of your story? What themes are running through it? Forget plot, forget characters, forget details specific to the plot. Think about the general underlying story—at its heart, what is it? — location: [545](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=545) ^ref-763

---
As you create your editorial map, keep an eye out for weak spots and scenes you want to work on later. Add revision notes at the end of your scene summaries, such as: “Needs stronger goal,” or “Fix character arc.” — location: [576](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=576) ^ref-8353

---
What is the point-of-view character trying to do in this scene? (the goal) Why is she trying to do it? (the motivation for that goal) What’s in the way of her doing it? (the conflict and scene obstacle) What happens if she doesn’t do it? (the stakes) What goes wrong (or right)? (how the story moves forward) — location: [586](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=586) ^ref-1954

---
What important plot or story elements are in the scene? (what you need to remember or what affects future scenes.) — location: [589](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=589) ^ref-51681

---
If you can’t summarize the action in the scene, that could indicate there’s not enough external character activity going on. Perhaps this scene has a lot of backstory, description, or infodumps in it. Be wary if there’s a lot of thinking, but no action taken as a result of that thinking. Make notes on ways to add the character’s goal back in, or how to possibly combine the scene with one that’s weak on internal action. — location: [596](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=596) ^ref-14988

---
Revision Tip: Try highlighting your notes in different colors to denote different elements, such as green for goals, red for tension. That makes it easy to skim over your editorial map and see where and what the weak spots are. — location: [605](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=605) ^ref-9073

---
You might even have two or three paragraphs per scene: One for the plot, one for the character arcs, and one for information you need, but the characters don’t know yet. — location: [618](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=618) ^ref-52724

---
Do the descriptive details show judgment on the point-of-view character’s part? This is a good test to see if you're the one telling readers what something looks like or if the point-of-view character is describing it in her own words. How often do you walk outside and think, "Gee, look at those soft, fluffy, white clouds drifting gently across the sky." You’d more likely think, "Pretty day" or something that fits your personality and the situation. — location: [3658](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=3658) ^ref-36038

---
Is the point-of-view character describing details the same way no matter what she’s feeling or doing, or is she seeing it based on how she feels at that point in time? — location: [3670](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=3670) ^ref-39707

---
A quick test for infodumps is to look at the information and ask, “Is it for the character’s benefit or the reader’s benefit?” If it’s to inform the reader, it’s dumping. — location: [3699](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01L465U1W&location=3699) ^ref-6745
