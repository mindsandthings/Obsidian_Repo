The virtual community writethedocs.org describes itself as “a global community of people who care about documentation,” or, as the site founders put it, documentarians . Since 2013 when the site was founded, it has grown to house an enormous collection of resources for people who care about documentation. — location: [1233](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=1233) ^ref-53057

There are other conferences besides those run by the STC and Write the Docs, where you can make important connections and add to your skill set. Section C.5, “Organizations and conferences,” in Appendix C lists several sites where you can sign up for conferences that should help increase both your network and your technical-writing skills. — location: [1280](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=1280) ^ref-12545

---
Less expensive than conferences are local Meetup groups. Go to meetup.com to search for gatherings in subjects that you think may be useful in your career, or even any subject that interests you. Networking occurs in many ways, and the more people you meet, especially if you are doing something you like, the wider your network will become. — location: [1287](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=1287) ^ref-3594

Attend events aimed at managers. Go where your next boss might be, whether it’s a Meetup event or a session at a conference. Don’t just sit quietly in a corner—​talk to people about some of the ideas that some up during the session. — location: [1304](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=1304) ^ref-7190

---
Keep thorough notes when you gather information and refer to them as you write. Whether your information-gathering tools are digital recorders, notes on a phone or tablet, comments in a PDF, or pen and paper, they all work as ways of recording information. Plan to keep these notes for a while; at least until the next release comes out. If you are ever in a position of having to defend yourself, it can’t hurt to have all the facts. See Chapter 14, Gathering information, for more about this. — location: [1487](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=1487) ^ref-20315

---
Although you may be accustomed to writing long, detailed technical documentation, when writing web content, brevity can be much more important. Consumers who are attempting to buy something online don’t want to wade through long amounts of text to find out how to do it—​they want to move quickly through the process. — location: [1577](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=1577) ^ref-60198

---
Technical writers who don’t fully understand their subjects sometimes make the mistake of trying to rewrite a technical term they aren’t familiar with, rather than using the one currently understood by the people who use the product. Use simple and clear terms, but above all use the terms your users understand. — location: [1816](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=1816) ^ref-37851

---
once you use a specific term for something, use that term consistently, not only in one document, but in every document, help set, data sheet, and web reference. If you use a different term, even once, the user thinks you are talking about a different concept or object and becomes confused. — location: [1824](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=1824) ^ref-8343

---
When writing in English, maintain simplicity and clarity by refraining from using unnecessary non-English words. That includes all Latin abbreviations such as etc., e.g., as well as words and phrases in other languages. — location: [1848](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=1848) ^ref-32964

---
Keep it simple by following these rules: Use a short word rather than a long one where you can. Keep paragraphs to no more than six lines. Keep sentences to less than twenty-five words. — location: [1930](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=1930) ^ref-45737

There is/there are. Eliminate it altogether. In the event that. Replace it with “if.” Definitely. Eliminate it! Actually. Eliminate it! Totally, particularly, especially.

Simplified Technical English (asd-ste100.org) is a controlled language that was developed in the 1980s for use in commercial aviation maintenance documentation. Since aerospace maintenance mistakes can cost lives, STE strives to reduce ambiguity, improve the clarity of procedural writing, and make translation—​both human and machine—​easier and cheaper. For the same reasons, it has become standard in maintenance documentation for many industries. — location: [1978](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=1978) ^ref-34559

---
One negative often leads to another and before you know it, you’re writing something like “The Submit button is not enabled if you have not selected the correct item.” Hard to understand and hard to follow. Another reason to avoid negatives is that they suggest something’s wrong. Your company doesn’t want to see the word “no” associated with its product. As do most rules, this one has an exception. In cases of warnings or cautions in which you must let the users know that they should not do something, a negative is acceptable and preferable. — location: [2002](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2002) ^ref-7148

---
No need to say, “The firmware will enter an idle state” when you can simply say, “The firmware is in an idle state” or “The firmware enters an idle state.” If the user clicks a button to get an expected result, write, “The Properties dialog appears,” not “The Properties dialog will appear.” — location: [2014](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2014) ^ref-52500

---
At some point—​probably early—​in your tech-writing career, you’ll be expected to write procedures, numbered steps that guide a user through a process. — location: [2026](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2026) ^ref-29848

---
Every process has two points: a trigger and an end point. The trigger is what starts the ball rolling. It could be the last step in the previous procedure, or it could be an introductory paragraph preceding the procedure. The end point is the state or condition that happens when the procedure reaches its natural conclusion. And it should be a natural conclusion. The user should know that they have succeeded at reaching a goal, even if it’s a midpoint or milestone within a larger set of procedures. — location: [2037](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2037) ^ref-28623

---
Before the beginning of each procedure, make sure the user has been given all information about prerequisites. This might mean creating a section about what has to be done prior to starting the procedure, or it might mean referring the user to a previous section or different document. — location: [2046](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2046) ^ref-8522

---
Make sure each step actually involves something the user does. “A dialog appears” is not a step; it’s the result of a step. — location: [2050](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2050) ^ref-33953

---
Address only one significant action, or one short group of related actions, in each step. It’s a common mistake to try to cram too much information into a single step. Make sure each step is an action large enough to be meaningful. If an action is microscopically small, go ahead and combine it with a follow-up step. You don’t want a procedure to be full of tiny actions too small to be significant. Provide obvious transitions or connections. The reader must never wonder if a step has been left out. Provide context or repeat “landmarks” such as screenshots every now and then to keep the reader oriented. — location: [2059](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2059) ^ref-56066

---
One method of chunking that can work for very long sets of procedural steps is to have a numbered “step heading” that can be used to group substeps. — location: [2066](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2066) ^ref-6032

---
Should, by nature, is ambiguous. When you find yourself wanting to use the word should, stop to consider what you really mean. Is this a required action, or something that is recommended? Does it refer to something you just hope will happen but you’re not sure? If it refers to an action that you expect to occur, say so (“The Finish page appears…” instead of “The Finish page should appear…”). — location: [2091](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2091) ^ref-18999

---
There will be users who know more than you and will be more technical than you. It can be intimidating creating developer documentation when you aren’t a developer or end-user documentation for users who are highly skilled at their jobs and need to fulfill tasks you do not understand. Despite those differences, you can still create useful and meaningful documentation for these users. Don’t be intimidated—​technical writers have been doing this for years. Go to the person in your own company who most closely resembles the person for whom you are trying to write—​the developer or developers who are creating the product or managing the system. They not only will tell you what one of their peers would expect to — location: [2128](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2128) ^ref-20199

---
Writing for any user involves task analysis, as you determine what tasks your users need to perform and what steps enable them to complete those tasks. You may create a persona (a fictitious version of a user type), if only in your head, that describes your target user. Give the target user a name and a face so you have a concrete mental picture of the person for whom you are writing. — location: [2143](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2143) ^ref-3686

---
“What is the user’s goal?” should be your main question. Once you answer it, you know where to go from there. For example, is your user running reports with your software? They will need to know how to use the software to get the information they need. They may also have to know how to perform additional work tasks, including some that are new to them. — location: [2147](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2147) ^ref-8865

---
How often do you expect the user to refer to the documentation? Continually? Daily? Only when something goes wrong? Will the documentation perform a time-critical task such as teaching the user how to quickly master a product’s basic features and functions? Or will it be a reference work that provides information beyond the user’s basic tasks? Knowing how someone uses documentation helps you decide the kind of information to provide and also how to provide it to them—​whether it’s a downloadable PDF or searchable online help (sometimes known as user assistance) or screen content. — location: [2156](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2156) ^ref-56413

content. Many users do not refer to the documentation at all until they have trouble. — location: [2163](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2163) ^ref-51336

---
Companies must prioritize documentation deliverables to stay within budget, and that often means that some documentation does not get done. Your responsibility as a writer may be to ensure that all end-user documentation has top priority. Or you may be asked to focus on customized documentation for a key customer. Or it may be decided that you will not create documentation for internal customers. — location: [2176](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2176) ^ref-44629

---
well. Your first task is to identify the people who are likely to need documentation. You will talk to Product Management, Customer Support, Sales, and Engineering to come up with a list of your documentation’s end users. Your list may look something like this: Potential customers, who are people targeted by the sales staff in your company (and can be anyone from a technical staff person to a business executive who makes buying decisions) End users, who use the product for the tasks it is meant to perform Installers, who set up hardware or install software on your customer’s machines Quality assurance (QA) staff or testers, whose job it is to make sure the product works Operations people, who manage the data center Developers and partners, who customize your software so it works with other companies’ business applications Trainers, who teach customers how to use the product Customer support representatives, who are the people in your company who help customers with their problems That’s a lot of users, and that’s only for the company’s core product. — location: [2186](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2186) ^ref-31719

---
There are probably many salespeople in your organization and they most assuredly use documentation to help sell your company’s product or put together a proposal. The salespeople aren’t exactly the users of your documentation in the traditional sense, but they certainly do put your documentation to use. — location: [2211](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2211) ^ref-24683

---
Sales representatives are looking for documentation that is informational and explains what the product does in a way that can convince the potential customers that it will solve their needs. Documentation for this type of user includes white papers, data sheets, and user guides. — location: [2214](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2214) ^ref-47576

---
A novice is a new user, the person who knows nothing about your product and is trying to learn enough about it to put it to use. You must always provide documentation for the end users. You must assume they know nothing about how to use your product, but be aware that they may know a lot about their business and their job tasks. — location: [2240](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2240) ^ref-51014

---
Novices need something short and simple with which they can get started quickly. Their goal is to perform the tasks they need to do their jobs or to start enjoying their new “toy,” but they are not necessarily interested in reference material or advanced tasks. Think about a new phone. If you buy a phone from a manufacturer with whom you are unfamiliar, you can typically expect to make a call, take a picture, and text without having to read any instructions or spend a lot of time figuring anything out. It’s when you need to take a screenshot or upload your photos or perform other more obscure tasks that you may need documentation. — location: [2257](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2257) ^ref-35797

---
Examples of documentation for novices include user guides, quick-start guides that help them jump straight into performing a product’s key task, and tutorials that teach them how to get started. This may be in the form of on-screen help, which tells them exactly what to do now and in this place. — location: [2262](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2262) ^ref-41316

---
The expert user wants searchable or context-sensitive help—​in other words, help that is available when and where needed. — location: [2272](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2272) ^ref-63574

---
Users usually need more than a quick-start can guide give them. You may decide to also provide solutions on a knowledge base and a monitored community forum where users can share ideas. — location: [2313](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2313) ^ref-2382

---
email. In many companies, you might be expected to provide developer documentation for the internal team. Developer documentation may consist of internal documents, like design documents, use cases, or technical requirements documents. — location: [2343](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2343) ^ref-47193

The trainer’s goal is to learn enough about the product to be able to teach the trainees what they need to know. Classroom trainers typically use a slide deck with high-level information and fill in the information with their own specialized knowledge. — location: [2350](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2350) ^ref-40712

---
It is very important for you, the person who provides customer documentation, to have a good relationship with the trainers in your company. — location: [2352](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2352) ^ref-58526

---
Knowledge bases typically have two purposes: to allow people within an organization to access information and, more important, to enable external customers to access information from the company’s website. — location: [2376](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2376) ^ref-30798

---
Technical writers often must create one document that serves the needs of many user types. This may be because of budget reasons. Or it might be because someone in the company doesn’t want to scare users by giving them too many different guides—​it makes the product appear to be too complicated. This can mean supporting two totally different functions, like a combination user guide and installation guide, or it could mean providing information for both novice and expert users in the same document. — location: [2396](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2396) ^ref-41743

---
One way to provide information for both is to give a quick-start section at the beginning of the document. — location: [2402](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2402) ^ref-38674

Audience analysis—​even the briefest sort—​can help you tremendously in getting started. If your company has a User Experience or Usability department, align yourself closely with them. — location: [2414](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2414) ^ref-35959

---
In many companies, you won’t have the time, budget, or authority to meet the people who use your product or your documentation. There are still some tricks you can use to define your user. Find out who your company thinks the target user is. The product manager should have a very good sense of who the target customers are and what they need to know. — location: [2434](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2434) ^ref-389

---
Become your own best customer. If your company’s product is a consumer product you might use yourself, great! Make notes of the things you want to know and the things that confuse you. If you have questions, other users will, too. Take lots of notes before you become too familiar with the product; too much familiarity often means you skip information that’s important to novices. Figure out what your goal is with this product and make sure you cover everything that enables you to achieve that goal. Find a surrogate user. If you can’t meet the customer, find someone who has a similar role and similar characteristics. Think about the personas discussed earlier and seek out an individual who best matches the target user. “Meet the customer” without actually meeting anyone by sitting in on customer support calls. Listening to customer issues is like being a fly on the wall and, like sitting in on training sessions, can provide huge amounts of information that will help you improve documentation. — location: [2439](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2439) ^ref-52219

Documentation, from PDF to HTML, from videos to CBT, should be Section 508-compliant to be approved by the government, but there is no reason you can’t follow the same guidelines for all user documentation.

Make sure that all images are tagged with “alt text” that describes the image. Screen-reading tools will read aloud the image description for those who cannot see the image. Avoid manual customization of fonts and styles. Use your template’s paragraph and character tags instead of attempting to manually format text after the fact. Make sure users can access both website content and documents destined for PDF via the keyboard. — location: [2471](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2471) ^ref-15543

---
you’ll typically find that there is already documentation of the type you have been hired to produce. There may even be strict department guidelines about what sections belong in these documents and what these sections should cover. If so, once you understand for whom you are writing the documentation, you can take what already exists and modify it for your project. — location: [2489](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2489) ^ref-909

---
It is a good idea to start out by defining a manageable number of documentation deliverables and build around them. For example, your department might have a standard that says each new product gets an installation guide, online help, and release note. As you develop more and more documentation as it’s needed, you can add more to a product’s documentation library. As the documentation becomes more mature, you may add troubleshooting, integration documentation, and more. — location: [2497](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2497) ^ref-1301

---
You can get a jump-start on creating task-based documentation if the developers in your organization create use cases. A use case is a written description of an interaction between an outside “actor” and the system, to accomplish a specified goal. — location: [2526](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2526) ^ref-62843

---
As you write these procedures, you may realize that the software or hardware has functionality and features that you never mention at all. Many products have a lot more features than are commonly used. (Think of how many things your phone or computer can do that you’ve probably never even tried.) Some products have legacy functionality that isn’t used in any common workflow. Those little-used functions can be saved for a reference manual or maybe put in an appendix in the user guide. (You will have to document them somewhere, because customers of older versions who used those functions will want to know where they are in the newer version.) — location: [2531](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2531) ^ref-42722

---
In the reference-based approach, the focus is on what the product does. In other words, what does it look like, what does each menu, item, and button do, what does a command mean, what information goes into a text field? — location: [2538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2538) ^ref-54955

When you are short on time or have the budget to produce only a single piece of documentation for your product or don’t yet know how the customer will best use your product, you may choose to provide reference-based user documentation. You can plan to go back later and expand it with a task-based approach. — location: [2547](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2547) ^ref-5781

To understand what is involved in the deliverables described in this section, I recommend that you search online for examples of the types of documentation described and use those examples as guidance when you have to develop similar documentation. Two excellent places to find highly complex documentation of all types is on Cisco’s corporate website at cisco.com or Oracle’s site at docs.oracle.com/en. — location: [2575](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2575) ^ref-63945

When planning installation documentation, think about all of the following: Prerequisites. Let the user know everything that must be in place before the installation can start. Does the installation require a specific version of the Linux operation system? Does it require a certain amount of disk space or memory before the user can begin? The installation of another program before this one can be installed? There’s nothing more frustrating than starting to do an installation and only then discovering that you can’t go far because there is a whole list of things you needed to do first. Context. Tell the users where to start. Do they unzip a package of files onto a specific server? Log in as a specific user? Download an executable that will start the installation with no further action on their part? Dependencies. What else can affect this installation? Is there a specific step the installer must take if two applications are installed on the same (or different) machines? Does installation of one component require the installer to configure another component? Troubleshooting. What does the user do to resolve a problem if something goes wrong during the installation? Upgrade. What steps do users take if they are upgrading to a later version of software? How are those steps different from those involved in what is called a clean, or fresh, installation? — location: [2654](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2654) ^ref-18540

installation. It’s very important for you to perform installations yourself so that you can write accurate and complete instructions. If your organization doesn’t seem to think that’s necessary, it’s because they don’t have experience with tech writers who actually write their own documentation as opposed to simply formatting what a subject matter expert hands off. — location: [2667](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2667) ^ref-39226

---
Omitting prerequisites is a common mistake in technical documentation, often caused when writers depend on a subject matter expert to tell them how the installation is done instead of doing the installation themselves. Performing your own installation for the first time is one time when your lack of experience can be beneficial, because you will become acutely aware of what is missing as you step through the procedures. — location: [2671](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2671) ^ref-5141

Troubleshooting documentation contains descriptions of problems the user might encounter, with information about how to solve those problems. Everybody wants troubleshooting documentation, but it is often the last piece of documentation to be produced, because it is just that difficult. The writer sometimes needs to be a bit of a psychic to guess what problems might occur and a detective to run around and gather up information on these likely problems. The biggest difficulty is that, often, no one knows what the problems are until they happen. And then everyone is so busy trying to solve the problem, they certainly don’t stop to write down what happened or think about letting you know about it. Because an effective troubleshooting guide requires history and experience, it’s rarely possible to do a good one right away. — location: [2716](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2716) ^ref-42835

Until you become knowledgeable about the product and your audience, ask for as much help as you need.

8.3.8. Conceptual documentation External and internal customers often want to know how things work. You can be a star if you are able to write a good theory of operations, a document that explains how a device or system or solution works. Such a document can help end users perform their own configurations or troubleshoot, once they understand the big picture. It can also serve as a marketing tool that lets a company show off its technology. You might also be asked to write a data sheet. Data sheets, typically short and intended to give a customer a high-level explanation of a device or component, provide specification details, but usually at a higher level than the specification documentation and in a language aimed toward a broader audience. — location: [2813](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=2813) ^ref-11097

Read product literature, specifications, and engineering documentation to get a basic education about your subject matter. Learn by using the product so you can understand it thoroughly. Find out more about reading and learning in detail in Chapter 10, Become your own subject matter expert. Understand your audience by gaining knowledge of your users’ needs. Chapter 7, It’s all about audience, discusses how to do this. Interview subject matter experts (SMEs, in technical-writer-speak), and understand how the product works from the inside out. Chapter 14, Gathering information, contains pointers on interviewing. Listen while attending all the training sessions and meetings you can. Sometimes the team forgets to invite the tech writers to the important meetings.

A writer must make certain that all documentation tasks are accounted for in the sprints—​not just writing, but also ensuring that the team members review the content, and that there is time to proofread, build help, and perform other production tasks.

It’s your job to speak up for the fact that there is almost always a set of document production tasks near the end of the development cycle. At some point, you must assemble the bits and pieces you’ve written during the sprints and turn them into a deliverable—​a help library, a guide, web content, or all of the above. The team must respect that these tasks must occur, and you must make sure that you plan for them. — location: [3011](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=3011) ^ref-11714

Writers accustomed to working with the waterfall model will typically determine at which point they need to start getting involved, and they will work on their own documentation timeline, planning to deliver their final product around the same time as the product is released. This system allows the writer to work more independently than does the Agile method. While this method works well for many tech writers, it also has its downside. The writer is not always part of the team and sometimes acts more like a visiting reporter. The writer frequently doesn’t learn how the software behaves until very late in the cycle and then has to — location: [3021](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=3021) ^ref-35729

It’s tempting to just nod and pretend you get it when you hear something you don’t understand—​but don’t do it. You may think you look smarter, but it can have disastrous consequences later.

A common complaint of developers is that technical writers keep coming back to ask the same questions. Don’t be one of those writers—​you wouldn’t like it if someone did that to you, would you? Before you go to a developer the first time, make sure you understand as much as you can, and have specific questions ready to ask. When the developer tells you something, write it down and check to make sure you understand. If you need more clarification, go back for more explanation, but be specific about what part you don’t understand so at least you’re acknowledging that you know it was explained already. — location: [3220](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=3220) ^ref-32577

As you ask questions and learn more, you may be surprised to discover that the developers in your company don’t really understand how the customers will use the product. In many cases, software is built solely to meet the requirements. The developers fit as many features and functionality into the products as they think they can and assume that an expert user will know exactly what to do with them. This is not particularly helpful in figuring out how to explain tasks to your users. Make sure you talk to someone (try Support or Sales if you aren’t getting that information from Product Management or Product Development) who really understands the customers and what they need to do. If there’s no one like that at your company, the next step is to try to learn what the customer knows. — location: [3233](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=3233) ^ref-926

completely. Think about quality as consisting of five factors, listed here in order of importance: Accurate. Every single piece of information is true and described unambiguously. Complete. You have anticipated what the user needs to know and included it all. Professionally produced. No typos, no sentence fragments, no bad formatting. Headings and terminology are used consistently. Usable. Well-organized and presented in a format that suits the product and its users. (We’ll learn more about usability in Chapter 12, You want it how?) Good out-of-the-box experience. You don’t have as much control over this, and it’s definitely more important to companies that favor “good” over cheap, but your documentation can help. — location: [3317](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=3317) ^ref-50195

Deadlines are tricky. If you give your reviewers too little time, they will be (rightfully) angry at your lack of consideration. If you give them too much time, they tend to put the job off and forget about it.

Look at the calendar before setting the deadline and make sure you take weekends and holidays into consideration. Monday is not a good day to set as your deadline, because even though some people do work over the weekends, most will not, and it’s another opportunity to forget your review. The end of Thursday is an ideal time for review comments to come back, because it gives you one workday to either remind the recalcitrant reviewer or to incorporate the comments. If you can, ask for comments back a bit sooner than you really need them, so that if a key reviewer does not respond, you have some extra time to chase down that important feedback. — location: [4923](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=4923) ^ref-35228

If you become self-employed, you must adjust your billing rate. You will become responsible for many more of your own expenses. You also are not guaranteed continual work throughout the year. A rule of thumb is to aim for an hourly rate of 1/1000th of your yearly salary, so if your current salary is $60,000, you would charge $60 an hour. Another formula suggests you charge 1/100th of a yearly salary as a daily rate, which would be $600 a day. The rate you can charge will also depend on the market and what businesses are willing to pay. It would be a good idea to discuss your plans with an accountant before going into an endeavor like this. — location: [6617](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=6617) ^ref-52650

Contractors in the technical-writing world frequently work for agencies, or “job shops”—​that is, companies that source temporary workers.

Working as a contractor is a great way to get your foot in the door if you’re looking for a permanent job. If that’s your goal, make sure you let the hiring manager know you’re interested if anything should come up. (It’s not unheard of for a manager to hire a full-time employee without realizing that the on-site contractor was interested in the job.) Be aware, however, that it can be difficult for a company to convert the contractor to a permanent employee because they may have to pay a substantial fee to the agency the contractor works for. — location: [6645](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09X2CHHB1&location=6645) ^ref-393

And remember the discussion earlier in this book about the necessity of becoming involved with the business and what’s important to it? A contractor doesn’t have to do that. And for many, that’s just fine. It means avoiding office politics. Staying out of office politics can be one of the best things about being a contractor. There’s no need to get too hung up on the twists and turns of who’s doing what to whom.

Many contractors get work by networking at professional organizations. The more technical writers you know, the more likely you are to be on their mind when they next have or hear about a need for temporary help. But it’s not only technical writers that will help you.
