## Highlights
The creative mind (especially when certain high-process-oriented personality traits are present) requires the same fallow-ness. I’m not saying everyone needs to take a whole year (or winter or season) off from writing. “Fallow” time looks different for each writer. But for some of us, our minds really do need more fallow days than others, and that can be a common source of writer’s block. Those of us who are wired to look to other people for the “best practice” can sometimes overlook this need for fallow time in our own brains because we’re primarily looking at others’ processes. — location: [209](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=209) ^ref-19343

---
For some of us (the “thinkers” of the bunch), the “something” happening under the surface is the most important thing that happens in our brain. It’s part of what makes the words happen on the page. It is not a distraction from the page. It is the page. — location: [221](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=221) ^ref-57398

---
If the block is being caused by something necessary, then we want to acknowledge that first, because there are specific strategies to handle a block when it’s beneficial. Like the fallow time. You let the field be fallow, gather its nutrients, and then you plant again. You don’t keep trying to harvest from a fallow field. You create the right environment for the creative energy to come back, and then you seed. — location: [241](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=241) ^ref-2683

---
It’s possible for some people to write in uncertain times, but it’s also because they’re creating certainty for themselves. They’re addressing whatever physical or safety needs they feel most acutely (because, again, not everyone feels unsafe or uncertain for the same reasons), and then they are creating. — location: [284](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=284) ^ref-41466

The entrance into the fear spiral is the little moment where the cursor is scarier than anything else in your environment, and you’d rather not face that fear right now, so you go to Facebook, hoping to distract yourself from that essential pain. Then, you try to talk yourself back into it, and you spiral away again and back to Facebook. And — location: [339](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=339) ^ref-55790

---
When fear is involved, there’s no path directly to action. There’s only gravity and a funnel and a spiral. And sometimes, when the fear is big enough, that coin keeps spiraling and spiraling out of control, and never drops into the bank where the action happens. If we start to be more aware of when the fear crops up, then sometimes the spiral can be interrupted. That’s what we need to know. — location: [355](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=355) ^ref-14389

---
Are you seeing a predator on the blank page? That’s what we’re trying to determine here. Because if you are, then trying to force you into an action point isn’t going to help. — location: [359](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=359) ^ref-43363

---
When there’s a premise causing the fear, we have to deconstruct it. That means we have to talk back to it. We can’t keep agreeing with it. If the fear is, they’re all gonna laugh at you, you say back to the fear, yeah, I’ve been laughed at before and I made it through. I’ll be okay. If the fear is, they’re going to find mistakes in your work, you say back to it, yeah, there are mistakes in the works of the greatest authors. Mistakes don’t make me a bad writer. They just make me human. I’ll be okay. If the fear is, the book isn’t going to be good enough for everyone, you say back to it, yeah, no book is good enough for everyone, and it shouldn’t be. No one likes every book. I’ll be okay. — location: [371](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=371) ^ref-23300

---
That “parental” soothing voice is really important to engage in these moments because in order to flatten out that spiral, we need to deconstruct the premise of the fear. We can’t agree with it. And in this step, it’s really important to not let ourselves ask rhetorical questions. No what happens if that has no answer. This is one of the skills that emotionally resilient people have developed for themselves over the years. What happens if the book sucks? I’ll write a new book. What happens if everyone hates it? Other authors have survived that before. I’ll write a better book because of the mistakes I made in the first one. What — location: [377](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=377) ^ref-4124

---
If you ask those above questions without their subsequent answers, you’ll end up dropping the coin into the fear spiral instead of into the bank of action. Rhetorical questions are the worst. No rhetorical questions. Always make your logical brain answer the questions you’ve asked. — location: [389](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=389) ^ref-41949

---
Second action step: we need to clear the emotions that are leading us to the fear. If there’s a fear of failure or success, we need to gently walk through that process (for a great book on this, check out the Secret Thoughts of Successful Women by Dr. Valerie Young or Wired for Joy by Dr. Laurel Mellin). We may need to feel those feelings in a safe place so we can deconstruct them. — location: [392](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=392) ^ref-8593

---
This is a place where I recommend therapeutic approaches, to make sure you’re treating yourself safely (because we often don’t treat ourselves safely when we’ve assimilated skills meant to keep us in a certain state of emotional instability). — location: [395](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=395) ^ref-51471

---
our brains are very smart and adaptive, and when we make the same decision for most of our lifetime, our brain learns that decision is one to be made as quickly as possible. — location: [460](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=460) ^ref-17319

---
if you happen to be emotionally receptive, you’ve been practicing that set of decisions since you were very young and you’ve become quite good at them. You’ve likely developed consistent patterns of behavior that support the personality tendency toward being empathetic. You’ve learned skills to support the patterns. — location: [462](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=462) ^ref-37153

---
Why didn’t they like my book? What’s wrong with them? That kind of questioning is so often blocking for certain types of writers, specifically because their phoropter is configured to precise 20/20 vision, but they’re writing for a group of readers who don’t have that same definition of “good.” — location: [578](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=578) ^ref-59911

---
some of us are really stopped by this. Either we need to readjust our phoropters, or we need to find the readers who want the particular brand of blurry-ness or clarity that we’ve got behind our glasses, and we need to embrace that part of ourselves that wants what we want. — location: [593](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=593) ^ref-5839

---
If you don’t know what to write, you can’t see what comes next, you’re not able to make the words come out… that is not resistance. That is a different problem. — location: [642](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=642) ^ref-4484

If your tank is empty, you have to fill it. Period. It’s physics, y’all. Go fill your tank if you need to, and don’t feel guilty about it. That’s the solution to burnout. Recovery. — location: [644](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=644) ^ref-44852

Every expert has a chance to help you. But not every expert can / will help you. And part of your job as a smart better is to figure out which expert has a good chance of helping you. And if they end up not helping you, then that’s not. on. you. Super important to internalize that. — location: [719](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=719) ^ref-31161

---
It’s not your job to fit the mold of whatever expert is telling you to do whatever thing. It’s your job to be the expert in yourself and your fit, and to leave behind (as quickly as possible) the advice that doesn’t work for you. And some of you need permission to do this, because of the way you’re wired. By the metrics of success, you officially have permission to do this. Because the way we should be judging the effectiveness of someone’s advice is not by their success, but by ours. — location: [721](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=721) ^ref-47820

---
Think hard about this. Where is it time for you to back a new horse? Where is the “common advice” making you blocked in your process? Who can you release to do their work for other people, not for you? — location: [728](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=728) ^ref-64998

---
There are a lot of people for whom sitting down to write should be the last thing they do in their process, and not the first. Because they are waiting not for a magic muse to come to them in their attic, but they're waiting for their brain to finish processing the data that's churning around upstairs and that process, my friends, cannot be rushed, it can only be endured. There are things we can do to make the process easier. I call these the "incubation" steps. — location: [796](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=796) ^ref-56590

---
there are things that our brains can do to speed up the process of "inspiration." They usually do not include sitting down at the computer. Almost never. What do they look like? Well… some of you aren’t going to like hearing this, but they might include: walking driving playing video games playing mindless computer games watching television doing the dishes riding on a train sitting in a chair, staring at the ceiling — location: [803](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=803) ^ref-37531

when it used to be fun and now it isn’t, there are always reasons for that. You might have put too much pressure on yourself, or you might be believing things about the outcome that aren’t true, or you might — location: [871](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=871) ^ref-26074

some of us don’t have the words readily available at our fingertips because it takes us more time to translate our thoughts into words. — location: [896](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=896) ^ref-7396

---
If you take a longer time to form the words, it’s going to take longer to sit down and write them. — location: [899](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=899) ^ref-34002

---
some people’s brains are like a bread machine. They open the lid, put all the ingredients in, and close the lid. The machine (the brain) does the work of turning over the ingredients, making the dough, letting it rest, baking it, and then creating the pressure (the ding at the end) to open the machine and take the bread out and make a sandwich. — location: [903](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=903) ^ref-22685

---
If the story isn’t finished cooking, and you open that bread machine, what you pull out of there isn’t going to be sandwich-worthy. It may not even be edible. — location: [908](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=908) ^ref-46968

---
The “just write” advice is the equivalent of pulling the bread out too early partly because there is still work to do on the bread when you pull it out early. You still have to finish baking it, only now, it’s not surrounded by the heat elements anymore. Now it’s out on the plate, and you have to apply heat to it so the internal structure of the bread becomes intact. Have you ever tried to use a hair dryer to cook bread? That’s not unlike what this process can be like when you pull the story out too early. — location: [918](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=918) ^ref-27406

Strong objective-deciders need the outline. They are at their best when they can consider, analyze, strategize, map, and execute, before they jump in. They will move the fastest if they can make the decisions they need from outside the plot. They are going to be good at following that plan once they set it. Strong subjective-deciders do not need the outline. They are at their best when they jump into the book and figure the plot out from the inside of the writing. Their proverbial fingers need to be on the glass in order to know where they are. If they try to stand outside the snow globe and plan a path through, they will often plan the wrong path, because once their fingers touch the glass, they realize how they’re really going to get through it. — location: [1023](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=1023) ^ref-58627

---
wrong direction. But that's okay, because the longer they practice their fingertip-feeler-plotting, the better they will get at recognizing when things tend to go "off the rails." What they need is practice in subjective-decider writing. Not a class on objective-decider writing. — location: [1029](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=1029) ^ref-15742

---
Some of us have a combination of these traits, as well. The continuum has all points between the two extremes. So some of us will be primarily objective with some subjective, or vice versa. And of course, there are writers out there who are half and half. It’s really important to know what parts of your success process to trust, and when to reach for the right tool. — location: [1038](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=1038) ^ref-23015

There are certain coordinates that need to be plugged in, and then the computer will find its way through the story on its own. You can refine the computer over time--by learning more about structure maybe, or by getting a developmental edit on your work and figuring out where you typically go wrong--but drawing maps is not going to help you. — location: [1049](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=1049) ^ref-44666

anytime anyone has labeled you (or themselves) in a way that’s only meant to make you feel bad about yourself as a way to motivate you, you need to ask the following question: Am I motivated by negativity? — location: [1161](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=1161) ^ref-3473

---
if it’s the second, then you are not being motivated by the self-talk. The point is to motivate you. This clearly isn’t working. Find a new thought. Disagree with this sentence. — location: [1166](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=1166) ^ref-11420

---
What if the answer is, instead, to do what’s always made you successful, but do more of it? What if thinking really is the way to get unstuck for you? Or taking a break? Or reading a book? Or (gasp!) playing a video game? — location: [1200](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=1200) ^ref-3040

If you are blocked because you haven’t had enough “fallow” time, or your “bread-maker” needs more time to process, then you have to find the best and most efficient way to allow your fallow-ness to happen, or for your bread-maker to make its product. This often means letting go of the expectation that you “should” do any of the “common-sense” things that we suggest to break blocks. — location: [1213](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=1213) ^ref-49163

---
If you are blocked because your well is dry, you have to fill the well. Period. You’re going to come back to me and ask, “is this enough” after you’ve done it for awhile, and I’m going to say, “are you unstuck?” If you’re not unstuck, then, no, it’s not enough. (Again, if the dry well is the problem, this is the fix.) — location: [1218](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=1218) ^ref-47140

---
If you are blocked because there’s not peace in your environment, then you need to find as much peace as you can, or address the source of the non-peace with precision. No, it’s not going to go away on its own. You may have to do something about it. That “something” might be decluttering. It might be moving furniture. It might be a lot of different environmental tweaks that are specific to your environment. But if it’s physical-space related, then you have to address that. If you are blocked because something changed in your system, you might have to find a new… — location: [1220](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B088WD8Q5K&location=1220) ^ref-28495

If you are blocked because of pressure (you’re frozen because you’re not making enough money), and none of the above have worked for you in the past, then I highly recommend trying to relieve the pressure.

If you’re blocked because you’re afraid of how fans will respond to a book, you may need to talk to someone about that (I always suggest therapy, but coaches can be good here, if it’s not too close to the therapy/coach line).

If you’re blocked because you’re afraid, work on what we talked about in the last chapter. Deconstructing that fear. Yes, it’s fine to have fear still present, as long as it’s not fight-or-flight fear. Because you can’t fight your manuscript. You have to be in a non-adrenaline place to enter the creative process.

The third strategy is: reach out for help. A lot of us don’t like talking about writer’s block, and we for-sure don’t like admitting that we are blocked. We do a lot of free “group” coaching sessions for writers on our Better-Faster Academy Facebook page. There’s almost always one scheduled for the future. Come and ask us a question about your specific block. Or go to one of the many (many) writing coaches who are well known for doing good work and getting people unstuck. There’s more of a chance that they’ll be able to customize the advice they give you to your unique situation, and not that they’re just spouting what worked for them.
