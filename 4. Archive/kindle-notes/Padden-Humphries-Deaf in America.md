## Highlights
For example, consider deaf children from hearing families who encounter Deaf people and their culture outside the family. At what point are they said to have adopted the conventions of the culture and become Deaf? This question also applies to the acculturation processes of deaf adults who, after spending many years apart from Deaf people, come to join the community at later ages. — location: [88](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=88) ^ref-50293

A newly arrived deaf person is often given one of several borderline labels, such as “hard of hearing,” recognizing his or her past affiliation with those who speak. — location: [96](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=96) ^ref-56788

voice. These are the expected anecdotes, those which confirm the popular wisdom about deafness—that it is the experience of not hearing. But we also came across stories that, although they were about discovering deafness, seemed only remotely connected to the fact of loss of hearing. — location: [232](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=232) ^ref-11955

Carol. She has learned that, in the world of her parents and their friends, when one wishes to say something of note about someone, terms like “Deaf” and “hearing” are obligatory. Even at age five, she knows that in conversations about people one needs to refer to the person’s status. — location: [249](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=249) ^ref-22789

He will then have to learn how to carry out familiar activities within new boundaries, to learn new social contexts for his language. Skills he learned at home, such as to tell stories with detail about people and events, are not likely to be rewarded by teachers who do not know the language. His language will be subordinated to other activities considered more important, notably learning how to “use his hearing,” and to “speak” (Erting 1985b). — location: [317](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=317) ^ref-37598

For Tony, being deaf meant being set apart from his family and friends; he was “deaf” and had had an “illness.” In contrast, Sam, the Deaf child of Deaf parents, thought of being “Deaf” not as a consequence of some event, but simply as a given. For Sam, “Deaf” was not a term used to refer to him personally, but was just a normal way of describing himself and everyone he knew. — location: [363](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=363) ^ref-29620

But in a hearing family, the types of behaviors used to signal one another are different. One person can move his mouth and cause another person’s behavior to change. And they do not even have to be visible to each other; someone can move his mouth and make another person come into the room. Once one person acknowledges the other, they alternate moving mouths. Sometimes they look at each other, but sometimes they do not. — location: [378](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=378) ^ref-41360

The conventional belief is that there are certain immutable events, such as sound, that do not need translation and can be known directly. But Joe’s story reminds us that very little is not filtered through the larger pattern of everyday life. Sound is not an entity that is free of interpretation, but something that emerges within a system of knowledge. One does not merely “hear” thunder, but also must assimilate its place in relation to all other activity of the world, how to react to it, how to talk about it, how to know its relationship to other sounds. — location: [412](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=412) ^ref-18353

We finally realized that the story is not about the Abbé de l’Epée. Instead it has come to symbolize, in its retelling through the centuries, the transition from a world in which deaf people live alone or in small isolated communities to a world in which they have a rich community and language. — location: [509](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=509) ^ref-65465

The appearance of public schools for the deaf brought such children together with other deaf children and deaf adults, and increased the size of their social world significantly. — location: [527](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=527) ^ref-41208

While the folktale of Epée is a story about the creation of this community, it also recognizes the special circumstances of the people, that they must find one another within the world of others. Most are born into families that do not know of the community of Deaf people. Until they are somehow delivered to the school or the community around it, they cannot join the group, nor can they learn its history. Epée’s wanderings along a dark road represent each deaf child’s wanderings before he or she, like Epée, finds Deaf people. In every child is a Massieu, waiting to be delivered to a community and to be taught its language, or what Massieu calls “the signs of educated deaf-mutes.” At the end of this quest, as at the end of Epée’s search, is succor in the warmth of the community. — location: [535](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=535) ^ref-38047

The tale of Epée is a part of American, as well as French, folk mythology. For American Deaf people, too, it symbolizes the transition from an undesirable state of being—without the community or the language—to a desirable state. — location: [542](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=542) ^ref-59945

In Deaf Heritage the heading for this story reads, “Sign Language Saves a Life.” Indeed, but the story also tells what one cannot count on to save one’s life: gestures or speech. Relying on primitive gestures, one could very well find oneself hanged. Speech is likewise useless for saving a Deaf person’s life. It is the special knowledge gained from other Deaf people that can save one’s life. — location: [569](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=569) ^ref-59336

The choice of images that portray bleakness, imprisonment, and death, and the association of them with a world not designed by Deaf people but proposed by others, are not accidental, but are actively built into stories like these. — location: [644](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=644) ^ref-26983

---
As we mentioned earlier, the incidence of deafness-causing illnesses and genetic transmission of the trait across generations is low enough that a large proportion of the community is made up of members who must learn about the culture outside of their families. The special and specific knowledge of the community, the kind of knowledge parents usually pass on to their children, must somehow be imparted by other means. — location: [654](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=654) ^ref-4209

The sign HEARING has an official English translation, “can hear,” but in ASL HEARING is aligned in interesting ways with respect to DEAF AND HARD-OF-HEARING. In ASL, as in English, HARD-OF-HEARING represents a deviation of some kind. Someone who is A-LITTLE HARD-OF-HEARING has a smaller deviation than someone who is VERY HARD-OF-HEARING. In this way, ASL and English are similar—and yet the terms have opposite meanings in the two languages. The reason for this is clear: for Deaf people, the greatest deviation is HEARING. — location: [702](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=702) ^ref-31092

Each recommendation, each label, points to a group within the central category of DEAF, but more clearly to us, the recommendations taken together reveal a rarely described world of meaning used by people who refer to themselves as DEAF. As we began to sort out the different categories, we focused not so much on who was in each category as on how each category was used as a way of talking about the self and about relationships with other people. Some of the labels we came across are not used to establish commonality, but are used to label certain people as having lesser status—to marginalize them. To ignore the ways that Deaf people use a variety of labels, those which mock and tease as well as those which praise and respect, not only would paint an overly romantic picture but would make our description less rich. Each label, however petty or harsh some might seem, in its own way helps us to understand the group’s deep beliefs and fears. — location: [727](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=727) ^ref-43503

These official names contrast with that of an organization recently founded to meet the needs of adults who have lost their hearing at later ages: Self-Help for the Hard of Hearing (SHHH). Although this group’s membership includes people who are deaf, its social and political agenda is distinctly different from those of the other organizations. — location: [738](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=738) ^ref-37754

---
“Disabled” is a label that historically has not belonged to Deaf people. It suggests political self-representations and goals unfamiliar to the group. When Deaf people discuss their deafness, they use terms deeply related to their language, their past, and their community. Their enduring concerns have been the preservation of their language, policies for educating deaf children, and maintenance of their social and political organizations. The modern language of “access” and “civil rights,” as unfamiliar as it is to Deaf people, has been used by Deaf leaders because the public understands these concerns more readily than ones specific to the Deaf community. Knowing well the special benefits, economic and otherwise, of calling themselves disabled, Deaf people have a history, albeit an uneasy one, of alignment with other disabled groups. But as our friend on the subway reminded us, “disabled” is not a primary term of self-identification, indeed it is one that requires a disclaimer. — location: [752](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=752) ^ref-34238

person.” Leo Jacobs, in A Deaf Adult Speaks Out (1974), identifies nine categories of deaf people: the average deaf adult, prelingually deaf adults who come from deaf families, other prelingually deaf adults, low-verbal deaf adults, uneducated deaf adults, products of oral programs, products of public schools, deafened adults, and hard-of-hearing adults. The first category — location: [797](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=797) ^ref-54718

The label L-V (“low-verbal”) is used for educational unfortunates, but often also as a blanket term for low-income ethnic minorities. A common alternative term for L-V is “not smart.” — location: [806](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=806) ^ref-39488

Real HARD-OF-HEARING people walk a thin line between being Deaf people who can be like hearing people and Deaf people who are too much like hearing people. They can be admired for their ability to seem like others for specific purposes, but they are viewed with suspicion when they begin to display behaviors of the others when there is no apparent need to, such as when there are no hearing people present. A friend who uses the telephone “without effort” confided that in the presence of new Deaf acquaintances she finds herself feigning difficulty on the telephone to avoid being categorized toward the hearing end of the HARD-OF-HEARING continuum. — location: [855](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=855) ^ref-21824

languages are derived from spoken languages and have been invented by individuals such as Epée. His repeated references to Epée and Gallaudet suggest that he thought signed language would gain prestige or respect by being associated with leading hearing figures.

What did these writers mean by “a correct form of delivery” and “a clear-cut, carefully chosen style of delivery”? What could these phrases mean but a sense of rules?

With Krauel, as with Veditz and others, we see again the contradictory ways of talking about the language. Krauel says his language is not good for children, but it is natural and efficient.

This doublespeak grows out of an attempt to reconcile two very powerful truths: signed language is rejected by the larger society, but it is the essence of how Deaf people live and how they understand their lives. Having to live with both these truths, Deaf people acknowledge the official truth by using the official vocabulary but reserve a special vocabulary for the oppositional truth, their own contrary knowledge. — location: [1102](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=1102) ^ref-61985

Here we see a symbolic opposition between the ways the two men are described.

As we watch the other characters interact with Lindsey, we see that they do not take him entirely seriously, in fact they hold him at a distance.

what others say it is, a form inferior to human language, and worse yet, that people who use it may also be inferior. Shalleck is, after all, only a bartender. — location: [1161](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=1161) ^ref-19928

More important than these new labels—and perhaps in some ways even more bewildering to someone who was raised when “the sign language” was “just something we did”—is the new self-consciousness about signed language, the new way of thinking about the language. This new focus has come about along with recent scientific investigations — location: [1211](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=1211) ^ref-10542

orientation of the hand with respect to the body. In creating this segment, the members of the NTD company discovered a new way of thinking about signs. The actors first look at the audience but then slowly, by changing the direction of their gaze, invite the audience to watch their hands instead of their bodies. As the actors move around the stage, forming new groups for each demonstration, the focus of the performance is on the signs themselves. — location: [1242](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=1242) ^ref-21579

---
the first steps toward this kind of analysis of signed language came from a radical proposal by William C. Stokoe for a new way to describe signs. Stokoe broke with the earlier tradition of describing signs as whole “picture” units. Drawing heavily on the work of structuralists like George Trager and Henry Smith, he suggested that each sign can instead be analyzed as being composed of smaller units: — location: [1319](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=1319) ^ref-3259

As one founding member, Lou Fant, tells it, the task of translating material into signed language provoked serious arguments within the company about which “form” of the sign language should be used for the stage (Fant 1980). — location: [1354](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=1354) ^ref-33294

language. It is perhaps polemical to say that the performances of Deaf people showed that they always knew the potential of the language, but they did, after all, know. What we now see is a new reflectiveness about their language and a new vocabulary for describing it. — location: [1485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=1485) ^ref-64038

To hearing people the metaphor of silence portrays what they believe to be the dark side of Deaf people, not only an inability to use sound for human communication, but a failure to know the world directly. For hearing people, the world becomes known through sound. Sound is a comfortable and familiar means of orienting oneself to the world. And its loss disrupts the way the world can be known. — location: [1508](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=1508) ^ref-63058

Inevitably, at some point in the development of their knowledge about sound, Deaf children begin to understand that one important thing to learn about sound is how hearing people think about it. — location: [1586](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=1586) ^ref-35592

His brother had explained to him that, as a deaf child, he should be extremely careful about how he urinated. The sound generated by a certain placement of the stream was very disturbing. He should always aim for the porcelain, not into what he had thought to be the logical receptacle, the water. If he neglected this responsibility, people would become very angry with him and think terrible thoughts about him. He reenacted for us his innocent, wide-eyed reaction. He had had no idea that such sounds could be offensive and was horrified at the thought that by the simple act of relieving himself he could incur such disapproval. — location: [1605](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=1605) ^ref-41863

Some stomach rumblings seemed to us to be loud enough to attract attention, while some others did not, perhaps because such noises are so common that people agree not to notice.

The trick for Deaf people living among hearing people is to figure out the complicated meanings attached to various sounds. Sometimes Deaf people develop good theories about these sounds, but at other times the meanings of sound are much more elusive. — location: [1625](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=1625) ^ref-29780

She became so worried over this uncertainty that she chose what she decided was the safest route: perform nothing that could result in a sound. But of course this solution did not work. She had become so obsessed with being silent that she could no longer use a public bathroom. Then, one day, she came to her senses and decided she would no longer worry about this. She’d simply do whatever she wanted (within reason, of course), noise be damned! We cheered. — location: [1631](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=1631) ^ref-2091

Deaf people, along with learning about properties of sound and the meanings attached to it, encounter another sobering lesson: the realm of sound very often involves issues of control. It is not surprising that what others use as a central definition of their own lives, sound, should become a powerful tool of control. — location: [1638](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=1638) ^ref-30021

Deaf people know that sound belongs to hearing people except in the few situations when they are allowed to use it. As Bragg’s story and the reminiscences of our friends tell us, they are very often required to be silent if they cannot master the sound well enough. — location: [1683](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=1683) ^ref-20531

Our approach in this book has been to shift attention away from deafness itself to the way Deaf people live—to their culture. We have taken this approach in order to introduce a new way of thinking about what it is to be Deaf. But this does not mean we are ignoring the fact that Deaf people do not hear or that we are treating it as unimportant. Indeed, our point is that the biological characteristic of not hearing is intimately bound up with Deaf people’s culture and language. Deafness is a given, a fundamental aspect of their world. This is what we mean when we say we want to look at their lives from “a different center.” — location: [1815](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DM1D3XU&location=1815) ^ref-38566
