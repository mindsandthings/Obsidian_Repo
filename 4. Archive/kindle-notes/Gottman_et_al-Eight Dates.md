## Highlights
And when conflict comes, as it inevitably does when we weave two lives together, it’s our commitment to being curious rather than correct that allows us to turn toward instead of away from one another in the moments of disagreement. — location: [36](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=36) ^ref-35516

---
And the big secret to creating a love that lasts and grows over time is simple. Make dedicated, nonnegotiable time for each other a priority, and never stop being curious about your partner. — location: [60](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=60) ^ref-9390

---
As you have these conversations, remember that most couples are more dissimilar than similar. That’s okay. It’s not about finding your idealized mate, your other half, or your alter ego. Our partners don’t always have to think like we think. That’s what makes life interesting—it — location: [136](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=136) ^ref-6019

It was painstaking, methodical, and thorough research. The final result was the ability to determine with 94 percent accuracy who would stay married and who would eventually divorce. (After these results were published, John and Julie received far fewer invitations to dinner.) — location: [179](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=179) ^ref-26487

meaning. In “glorifying the struggle,” the couple expresses pride that they have survived difficult times, versus expressing the hopelessness of their hard times. They emphasize their commitment to the relationship versus questioning whether they should really be with this partner. They are proud of their relationship versus being ashamed of it. They talk about their shared values, goals, and life philosophy. They have intentionally created a sense of shared meaning and purpose, even in the way they move through time together. And they create intentional traditions in their relationship for connecting emotionally. We call these “rituals of connection.” Dates are an example of rituals of connection. — location: [198](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=198) ^ref-16677

Happy couples are not so very different from unhappy couples; they are simply able to make repairs to their relationship easier and faster so they can get back to the joy of being together. — location: [216](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=216) ^ref-4021

---
Each chapter in this book will guide you through eight different dates that will strengthen your relationship, but date nights should be a permanent part of a lifetime of love and connection. The goal is to have a special date once a week, and make that a priority in your relationship. — location: [244](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=244) ^ref-43438

occasions.” For the purposes of this book, a date is a preplanned time where the two of you leave your work life and your work-in-the-home life, and spend a set amount of time focusing on each other, and really talking and listening to each other. A date worth having is not the two of you sitting on the couch watching television together, or going to a movie, or joining friends for a night of dancing. It’s a special time set aside for just the two of you to connect. Think of it as sacred time. Leave your electronics at home or turn them off and check only when the date is over. And think of each of these eight dates as your first date. Plan them. Look forward to them. Get excited about them. — location: [265](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=265) ^ref-18193

John and Julie used to have a cheap date by getting dressed up and going to the beautiful Hotel Sorrento in Seattle, and pretending that they were hotel guests. They would sit in the beautiful lobby in front of a fire and nurse one drink all evening. They would answer each other’s open-ended questions for hours. — location: [296](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=296) ^ref-30807

Some parents worry about leaving their children with other people, but if you find a safe and reliable person to watch your children, you’re helping them learn that other people, besides their parents, are trustworthy and reliable. Children are incredibly resilient, and by showing your commitment to your relationship with your partner, you’re nurturing your children by ensuring that they will be raised by parents in a healthy and stable relationship. Children feed off of the love in a marriage. Remember they are constantly modeling you, and you want them to see how you sustain a loving marriage. — location: [303](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=303) ^ref-42678

---
The most important guideline for this book and for the eight dates that follow is to have an open heart and mind, an attentive ear, and a true desire and curiosity to connect. — location: [310](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=310) ^ref-21649

Read each chapter separately or together before the date. The beginning of each chapter explains why this topic is important to your relationship and what you need to know to make this a joyful part of a lasting relationship. — location: [313](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=313) ^ref-10568

In a relationship, commitment is a choice we make every single day, over and over again. We choose it even when we are tired and overworked and stressed out. We choose it no matter what attractive person crosses our path. We also choose it every time our partner makes a bid for attention and we put down our book, or look away from the television, or up from our smartphone, or stop whatever it is we’re occupied with to acknowledge their importance in our life. — location: [508](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=508) ^ref-3555

This wall around the two of you separates you from others in terms of your deepest emotional and physical connections. What Dr. Glass found in her research is that when people, especially people who are unhappy in their relationships, start confiding in another person about their relationship, they are opening up a window to this outside person. — location: [518](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=518) ^ref-64598

This is fucking sick. What the fuck

---
There isn’t a safety net. If things aren’t going well, we go to no one else to complain. Instead we need to go directly to our partner to work things out. Also, if we’re committed, we have given this person everything we have to offer. There’s nothing left over for another lover. That’s a risky decision, but it’s essential. Without this level of commitment, love will not last. — location: [527](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=527) ^ref-39098

---
There is one step that cascades toward all betrayals. It often happens when things aren’t going well in the relationship. That step is making negative comparisons of our partner with other real or imagined alternative relationship partners. — location: [535](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=535) ^ref-22951

---
Commitment is actually built on thinking and then communicating to one’s partner that he or she is precious, and not replaceable. In one’s mind, as well as in communication, we build commitment by nurturing our gratitude in what we have with our partner. We think to ourselves that no one can hold a candle to our partner, and in our mind we magnify the positive qualities our partner has and we minimize the negative qualities. We think and communicate that no one out there—real or imagined—can — location: [638](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=638) ^ref-37416

Marie hadn’t realized it, but she had internalized the idea that all conflict was to be avoided and if there ever was a fight, it meant the relationship was over. — location: [917](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=917) ^ref-10783

---
“I almost look forward to our conflicts now, because we always seem to come out of them understanding something new about each other and it brings us closer and closer. I don’t go looking for fights, but I don’t run away from them anymore either. I love that feeling when we get through a hard time together. That’s what a relationship is all about. — location: [921](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=921) ^ref-64460

---
Many of our problems travel with us, reincarnating in each relationship, until eventually we learn to recognize them for what they are and manage them appropriately. A big source of trouble is the misconception that our problems are all solvable. — location: [941](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=941) ^ref-36483

---
Our research has shown that 69 percent of the time, when couples talk about that one thing that they always argue about, it’s what we call a perpetual problem. It’s not going to be resolved. — location: [942](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=942) ^ref-12581

---
Relationships work to the extent that you have a set of perpetual problems that you can learn to live with. — location: [944](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=944) ^ref-7876

---
With solvable problems, there is a solution and this solution can be sustained. You share the housework, split time picking up kids, each choose a vacation spot, etc. Solvable doesn’t mean without work. It takes effort and action to keep the agreements you make with each other for the solvable problems. — location: [952](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=952) ^ref-60524

---
Recognizing a perpetual problem for what it is leads to accepting and valuing how each of you is different. At the core of managing conflict, especially when it comes to a perpetual problem, is accepting your partner for who they — location: [959](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=959) ^ref-12860

We get defensive, we criticize, we show contempt, and we turn away at the very moment we should be turning toward each other. We call these regrettable incidents—our nice term for a fight, and “master couples” know how to minimize the damage from words said in the heat of an argument. — location: [984](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=984) ^ref-29143

When it came to conflict, the masters always knew how to repair the damage done during a regrettable incident. — location: [987](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=987) ^ref-1125

Processing a fight means talking about what happened during the fight, without jumping back into the ring with your boxing gloves on. It’s the fight recap, where you figure out how to make this particular matchup go better in the future. — location: [989](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=989) ^ref-37678

Validating doesn’t mean agreeing. It means being able to complete a sentence like, “From your point of view it makes sense to me that you would have these feelings and needs. I get it.” — location: [998](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=998) ^ref-24274

We discovered in our research that taking responsibility—even for a small part of the problem in communication—presents the opportunity for great repair. It’s highly effective. — location: [1021](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=1021) ^ref-11686

The children are nurtured by the love between the parents as much as by the love they receive directly. — location: [1254](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=1254) ^ref-2540

One couple we know like to do what they call “sex review” after the fact. This usually happens the next morning over coffee, or even while they’re out running errands. — location: [1265](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=1265) ^ref-21844

---
But only 30 percent of couples, married or otherwise, use this direct approach. Most people will indicate they want to make love with a touch, a cuddle, or a kiss, and they will do so in what we call a face-saving way. — location: [1274](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=1274) ^ref-57232

As relationships mature, the bids for affection and sex will get more direct. And that’s a good thing, because there’s less chance for misunderstanding and hurt feelings to arise — location: [1278](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=1278) ^ref-47840

A great way to respond to no is realizing that “no” does not have to end connection. Then one can say, “Thanks for telling me you’re not in the mood. What are you in the mood for? Do you feel like taking a walk? Watching TV? Cuddling? Just talking? Or would you like time alone?” — location: [1303](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=1303) ^ref-38471

There’s one simple way to keep the passion flowing in your relationship—kiss. Kiss a lot. Kiss often. Kiss each time you leave each other, and each time you see each other again after being apart. — location: [1311](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=1311) ^ref-25467

Another key way to keep passion flowing is to express your fondness and affection and appreciation of each other verbally.

The top sex and passion killers in a relationship are: ~ Lack of physical affection, flirting, intimate connection apart from sex ~ Vital to-do things left undone ~ Emotional distance and intense conflict ~ Lack of safety, either emotional or physical ~ Exhaustion and stress ~ Feeling unappreciated — location: [1346](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=1346) ^ref-24642

For this conversation, you’ll want to be in your body. As you focus on discussing physical intimacy with your partner, tune into your physical experience as well. Midway through the questions, stop and check in with your body and your partner. Is your heart beating quickly? Is your breathing slow or fast? Are you turned on? Slowly scan from the tip of your toes up to the crown of your head, checking in with each body part. — location: [1364](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=1364) ^ref-43119

Trevor’s dad had died very young, at the age of 35. “My parents talked about taking us on lots of travel adventures, but the trips were always off in some magical future. Someday we would go to Disneyland. Someday we would go to Hawaii. And when my dad died, all those magical adventures died with him. Someday never happened. When you’re on your deathbed, you’re never going to regret the memories you’ve created with the people you love—you’re only going to regret what you didn’t do.” — location: [1415](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=1415) ^ref-9238

Research on a sample of 4,574 couples shows that, of all the issues married couples fight about, financial arguments were the single best predictor of divorce.

If you or your partner is starting a business, for example, it’ll take time and commitment and long hours, but as long as you are transparent about the commitment you’re making to your work and financial future, and you discuss it and make agreements with your partner ahead of time, it doesn’t have to be a deal breaker. And the long hours are not going to last forever. Obviously, unless we are independently — location: [1485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=1485) ^ref-61234

If you hired someone to do the work of maintaining a household, especially if you have children, the cost would be approximately $90,000 a year. This is what a “traditional” at-home spouse would get paid today to clean the house, be a personal shopper and personal assistant, run errands, and take care of the children. — location: [1513](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=1513) ^ref-32276

When asked, men equate money with being competent, responsible, and a provider. “Enough” money is often equated with strength, independence, maturity, competition, social power, and winning. — location: [1590](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=1590) ^ref-38553

Stereotyping one half of a couple as the Saver and the other as the Spender isn’t helpful. Each of you has a family history and values that were instilled in you.

Julie loves to climb mountains. John likes to study math equations. Luckily for them, there is no correlation between couples having common interests and relationship happiness. What this means is, you don’t have to play in the same ways to be a happy couple or to keep the fun alive in your relationship. But you both still have to play. And share your solo play with each other in the form of pictures, stories, and discussing how it made you feel. — location: [2048](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079VTH6RH&location=2048) ^ref-17832

Amazing things happen in relationships when a couple can grow and change and accommodate the growth of the other person.

The rituals you create in your lives together are important and will keep you connected. One of the rituals we hope you’ll create is, of course, a date night every week. You can also create mini-rituals for when you part from each other and return to each other—like the 6-second kiss. Think about ways you can celebrate the triumphs in life both minor and major. What will be special for the two of you? Think about ways you can create rituals around loss, setback, bad luck, fatigue. How can you best support each other? Think about community rituals with friends and rituals for birthdays and other celebrations. There is almost no end to the ways in which you can create shared meaning to connect as a couple.
