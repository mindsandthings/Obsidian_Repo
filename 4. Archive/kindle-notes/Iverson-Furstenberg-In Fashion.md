## Highlights
“Status” colleges feed top fashion magazines. But the work is anything but privileged: In an unspoken apprenticeship system, you are lucky to find a job as a low-paying slave as an editor’s assistant, for example, and lucky to work your tail off until the day two years later that you’re named assistant editor. The two words are the same—but the order is everything. — location: [547](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003F3PMT8&location=547) ^ref-36721

If you know you want to be a designer and cannot imagine anything else for yourself, go to fashion school. Best bets are Parsons or the State University of New York’s Fashion Institute of Technology (See the Creator section), both in New York City, or Central Saint Martins in London. If, on the other hand, you have diverse interests and are academically able to do so, attending a four-year liberal arts college before going to fashion school (either in BFA or MFA programs, depending on your skill set) would give you a stronger foundation and a lifetime of references upon which to base your designs. — location: [579](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003F3PMT8&location=579) ^ref-52585
