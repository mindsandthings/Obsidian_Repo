## Highlights
Visual performance can be conceived as a bell curve, with optimal performance at the peak. On one end of the curve are people who experience visual compression, and at the other end are those who experience visual disparity. — location: [153](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=153) ^ref-31827

When people try this with the disruptive lenses in the “down” position, they knock over the chair. When they try it with the lenses in the “up” position, they stop short of the chair. Their loss of orientation affects their vestibular system, and they feel as if the room is swaying. Fearful, they respond by slowing down, shifting their bodies forward or back, toe-walking, or waving their arms as they walk. All of these are consistent with the “stims” we see in autism. — location: [183](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=183) ^ref-62639

---
Many hyperactive children, for instance, see the world as two-dimensional rather than three-dimensional. Objects in their environment appear flat to them, and they don’t visually “feel” them. — location: [201](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=201) ^ref-24550

---
Hypoactive children, on the other hand, react to their visual problems by saying, in effect, “I give up.” Like a person simultaneously being told to turn left, turn right, go straight, and go backward, these children attempt to deal with a barrage of conflicting messages by doing nothing at all. — location: [207](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=207) ^ref-47598

---
Autistic and other disabled children often have perfectly normal focal vision—the central vision that allows us to identify objects when we look straight at them. In other words, they have no problem with the “What is it?” function. The problem lies instead with ambient vision, which involves the entire field of vision and tells us about the location of objects in space—the “Where is it?” function — location: [215](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=215) ^ref-34809

---
When ambient vision is functioning properly, the eyes work as a team, producing separate but overlapping images. This allows us to see in three dimensions, and to accurately judge distance and movement. In patients with autism or related disabilities, we typically see two types of altered vision: •“Tunnel vision” or compressed vision (hyperconvergence), in which the field of vision is constricted to a relatively small circle. Focusing only on what they see in this “tunnel,” people with compressed vision view the world in two dimensions and cannot accurately judge distance or motion. In some cases, the world appears to be collapsing in on them.1 •“Alternating” vision (hypoconvergence or visual disparity), in which the eyes see two different images with no overlap. The person who exhibits hypoconvergence is basically seeing two dissimilar and competing views of the world. — location: [219](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=219) ^ref-1513

---
Children with autism tend to look at other people from the corners of their eyes, not because they are aloof, but because monocular vision makes more sense than trying to interpret data from two eyes that aren’t working together. In addition, they may find it impossible to look at other people while conversing, because they can’t process visual and auditory information at the same time. — location: [252](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=252) ^ref-56949

---
In most cases, however, the patients remain disabled, because visual dysfunction is only one facet of their problem. But because vision is so key to performance, these individuals—despite the fact that they are still disabled—are able to open up to a new world of friends, family, and social and academic achievement that was once closed to them. — location: [296](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=296) ^ref-1269

---
Most severely disabled patients, in contrast, find daily life a constant struggle, and they will instinctively grasp for the solutions we can offer them. Even patients who are withdrawn and nonverbal often react powerfully to prism lenses, work willingly at therapy, and make great progress. — location: [326](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=326) ^ref-19639

---
A key difference between the medical and developmental models of vision is that while there are two visual systems, vision professionals trained under the medical model primarily address the structural problems that occur in only one of these: the focal vision system. — location: [387](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=387) ^ref-21363

---
Ambient vision, also referred to as peripheral vision, encompasses the entire visual field. It is a lower-resolution system that operates largely on a non-conscious level, and allows us to rapidly identify where we are and what is happening in our environment. — location: [394](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=394) ^ref-33970

---
While focal vision is largely static, ambient vision is dynamic, integrating with other sensory systems to update us constantly about our changing world—and it works correctly only if the “software” of the neural system is intact. — location: [396](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=396) ^ref-29068

---
Disrupt this ambient visual system, and simple activities that you take for granted—from climbing stairs, to watching TV, to talking with another person—can become highly difficult and stressful ordeals. — location: [421](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=421) ^ref-1472

---
Because ambient visual problems affect the “software” of the visual system, we can’t address them effectively with surgery or standard glasses. However, a crucial aspect of ambient vision is that, unlike focal vision, it is largely learned and thus can respond to intervention in the form of vision therapy. — location: [425](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=425) ^ref-56276

---
if given intensive training, animals subjected to early visual disruption can learn ambient visual skills—a finding that is equally true for humans. — location: [436](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=436) ^ref-43372

---
the concept of a “critical period,” after which visual problems are not correctable, is inaccurate. — location: [437](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=437) ^ref-59842

---
and Pettigrew, all of whom found that visual anomalies due to early deprivation could be completely reversed, well after any supposed “critical period” had elapsed. — location: [440](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=440) ^ref-43117

---
Conventional eye care professionals often use prisms in one lens, in order to compensate for ocular muscle imbalances. This is consistent with the medical model of visual defects as an issue of mechanics—that is, a hardware problem. The purpose of ambient prism lenses, however, is not to compensate for a mechanical defect, but rather to actually alter perception in ways that cause patients to reorganize their visual processes. — location: [528](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=528) ^ref-18275

---
Ambient (yoked) prism lenses consist of prisms of equal diopter before each eye. Both prisms are oriented in the same direction: either base-up, base-down, base-left, or base-right. — location: [535](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=535) ^ref-51074

---
Base-down yoked prisms displace the visual system upward, and near objects are amplified while distant ones are reduced. Base-up prisms displace the visual system downward, and near objects are reduced while distant ones are amplified. Base-left prisms make objects appear farther away on the left, and nearer on the right, while base-right prisms have the opposite effect. Ambient prism lenses cause a transformation in different planes, forcing patients to actively reorganize visual processes in order to achieve homeostasis. — location: [538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=538) ^ref-42583

---
Ambient prism lenses instantly create a new visual world, in which those adaptive mechanisms are no longer either necessary or relevant. As a result, patients must rapidly re-awaken previously suppressed visual processes, in order to make sense of their altered surroundings. — location: [544](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=544) ^ref-40307

For a fascinating look at how the distortions caused by prism lenses cause the viewer to reorganize and reintegrate visual processes, I recommend Living in a World Transformed, a classic work by Hubert Dolezal.19 — location: [565](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=565) ^ref-16553

vision as a process that emerges from the interaction of spatial, motor, and intellectual function, and involves four sub-processes (see Figure 2.1): centering (the “Where is it?” function), identification (the “What is it?” function), antigravity (relating to balance and posture in space), and speech/auditory processes (the ability to label what we see). — location: [581](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=581) ^ref-54758

---
As I continued working with yoked prism lenses, I found that many patients with severe anxiety—a problem generally believed at that time to be strictly psychogenic—had similar problems in integrating visual and vestibular input. These patients often responded wonderfully to yoked prisms, and my colleagues in the psychiatric community started sending me many patients suffering from anxiety. Often these patients displayed convergence insufficiency or convergence excess, along with poor resilience and saccadic eye movements. — location: [620](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=620) ^ref-64245

---
This pattern, which I saw over and over again in patients, opened my eyes to the concept that disorders labeled as “emotional” or “psychiatric” frequently stemmed in reality from correctable vision deficits. — location: [626](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=626) ^ref-30166

---
Dr. Flach and I later collaborated professionally in a research project that revealed that two-thirds of psychiatric patients suffer from some form of visual dysfunction, with the most serious deficits occurring in patients with schizophrenia, unipolar depression, or alcohol dependence. — location: [667](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=667) ^ref-29506

---
many autistic children respond to these problems by suppressing input from their vestibular and ambient visual systems and instead rely on focal vision, with the resulting effect that they do not experience motion sickness even in circumstances (such as spinning) in which they should. — location: [715](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=715) ^ref-41268

---
when we use prism lenses to retrain and reintegrate the visual system, we are not just restoring isolated visual skills. We are also, by extension, improving a patient’s ability to reintegrate visual processes with other sensory systems—auditory, tactile, proprioceptive, gravitational—in order to achieve a new and higher level of performance. — location: [720](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=720) ^ref-33383

---
Because people with autism shut down much of their higher visual processing, my hypothesis is that they bypass this “high road” and thus base much of their behavior upon inadequate input provided solely by the thalamicamygdala pathway. This is a very inefficient system, leading to chronically inappropriate emotional and behavioral responses and leaving little energy for higher functions such as communication. — location: [731](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=731) ^ref-60799

---
For patients to achieve a “feeling of normalcy,” this therapy must encompass both intersensory effects and intrasensory motor processing (see Chapter 5). My experience shows that the effects of ambient prism lenses, while initially remarkable, fade with time unless patients are given the opportunity to fully integrate and organize the perceptual changes brought about by wearing the lenses. — location: [753](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=753) ^ref-18232

---
Clinicians familiar with autistic individuals know that they display a fetish for numbers and letters, as well as spinning objects and running water. — location: [921](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=921) ^ref-33265

---
Deficits in dynamic attention will clearly reveal themselves in tasks such as catching a suspended ball, which requires ongoing awareness of posture, visual motor coordination, and active organizing of time and space. — location: [925](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=925) ^ref-44363

---
The tests also reveal which of the two primary styles of perception a patient uses: focal, or global. A patient who relies more on focal vision hones in on form and details, using eye fixations. A patient with a global perceptual style relies more on scanning the larger environment, using a repetitive sequence of saccades or scanpaths that allow the person to view the sub-features of a particular scene. The former type of patient views the trees, while the latter views the forest—and knowing which style a patient uses is crucial to selecting lenses and planning therapy. — location: [934](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=934) ^ref-22657

---
The Kaplan Nonverbal Battery The tasks in the Kaplan Nonverbal Battery are arranged logically in a hierarchy that allows an observer to see how the child deals with increasing demands on the visual system. The initial tasks focus on visual perception in isolation, while succeeding tasks require the patient to coordinate visual, vestibular, proprioceptive, auditory, and gravitational input. — location: [996](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=996) ^ref-59404

---
we can say that the efforts of individual muscles are letters of the language of movements, and synergies combine these letters into words, which carry far more meaning than individual jumbles of letters. Children with autism spectrum disorders or other developmental disabilities have a limited “dictionary” of synergies. As a result, they do not have time to visually interpret the abundance of cues in their surroundings, and must resort to slower senses of touch, taste, and smell in order to interact with the complexities of their environment. — location: [2138](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=2138) ^ref-270

---
Like coaches who advise players that “If you have to think, you’ve already lost,” visual management experts know that it is the preparation of movement synergies, and the resulting automaticity, that allow a patient to succeed. — location: [2144](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0033PRJXU&location=2144) ^ref-53353
