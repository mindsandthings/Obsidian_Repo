## Highlights
When you have a desired outcome (a truly portable laptop computer, a sexy-looking sports car, or a well-designed life) but no clear solution in sight, that’s when you brainstorm, try crazy stuff, improvise, and keep “building your way forward” until you come up with something that works. — location: [139](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=139) ^ref-62762

---
A well-designed life is a life that is generative—it is constantly creative, productive, changing, evolving, and there is always the possibility of surprise. You get out of it more than you put in. There is a lot more than “lather, rinse, repeat” in a well-designed life. — location: [152](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=152) ^ref-11334

---
In design thinking we always say, “Don’t start with the problem, start with the people, start with empathy.” — location: [204](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=204) ^ref-27072

---
The reframe for the question “What do you want to be when you grow up?” is this: “Who or what do you want to grow into?” — location: [215](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=215) ^ref-38366

---
In fact, we suggest you go out and get a design team right off the bat—a group of people who will read the book with you and do the exercises alongside you, a collaborative team in which you support one another in your pursuit of a well-designed life. — location: [253](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=253) ^ref-64466

Designers don’t think their way forward. Designers build their way forward. What does that mean? It means you — location: [273](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=273) ^ref-59150

You are going to build things (we call them prototypes), try stuff, and have a lot of fun in the process. — location: [275](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=275) ^ref-5495

Please stop saying over and over how much fun I'm going to have. At this moment, I'm wary and scared and already grieving a bit, and it's a struggle not to fall into seeing you as callously pushy and cult like

The five mind-sets you are going to learn in order to design your life are curiosity, bias to action, reframing, awareness, and radical collaboration. — location: [287](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=287) ^ref-35043

In this book, you will learn how to use mentors and a supportive community to help with your life design. When you reach out to the world, the world reaches right back. — location: [317](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=317) ^ref-5484

The challenge for me is fear about sharing just how bad some things are. It's really tough to reach out for help and be vulnerable while still holding back and presenting an acceptable version of your need

---
we’re not very passionate about finding your passion. We believe that people actually need to take time to develop a passion. And the research shows that, for most people, passion comes after they try something, discover they like it, and develop mastery—not before. — location: [333](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=333) ^ref-38831

Our problems become our story, and we can all get stuck in our stories. — location: [390](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=390) ^ref-9449

people waste a lot of time working on the wrong problem. If they are lucky, they will fail miserably quickly and get forced by circumstance into working on better problems. If they are unlucky and smart, they’ll succeed—we call it the success disaster—and wake up ten years later wondering how the hell they got to wherever they are, and why they are so unhappy. — location: [419](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=419) ^ref-7656

---
“I need a better job” is not the solution to the problem of “I’m not that happy working, and I’d rather be home with my kids.” Beware of working on a really good problem that’s not actually the right problem, not actually your problem. — location: [437](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=437) ^ref-49114

---
These are all gravity problems—meaning they are not real problems. Why? Because in life design, if it’s not actionable, it’s not a problem. Let’s repeat that. If it’s not actionable, it’s not a problem. It’s a situation, a circumstance, a fact of life. It may be a drag (so to speak), but, like gravity, it’s not a problem that can be solved. — location: [451](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=451) ^ref-52570

It is a CONSTRAINT

People fight reality. They fight it tooth and nail, with everything they’ve got. And anytime you are arguing or fighting with reality, reality will win. You can’t outsmart it. You can’t trick it. You can’t bend it to your will. — location: [455](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=455) ^ref-24962

---
Some of you are trying to decide if the thing you’re stuck on is a gravity problem that isn’t actionable, or just a really, really hard problem that will require effort and sacrifice and runs a high risk of failure but is worth trying. Let’s address this difficult issue by looking at each of the sample gravity problems we listed above. — location: [466](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=466) ^ref-8308

By “work” we mean your participation in the great ongoing human adventure on the planet. You may or may not be getting paid for it, but this is the stuff you “do.” — location: [529](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=529) ^ref-31417

Play is any activity that brings you joy when you do — location: [533](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=533) ^ref-31841

Love comes to us in a wide range of types, from affection to community to eroticism, and from a huge array of sources, from parents to friends to colleagues to lovers, but they all share that people thing. That sense of connection. — location: [540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=540) ^ref-64847

We want to stress that there is no perfect balance of these areas. We all have different mixes of health, work, play, and love in our lives at different times. — location: [559](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=559) ^ref-63554

---
health, we suggest you think about more than just a good checkup at the doctor’s. A well-designed life is supported by a healthy body, an engaged mind, and often, though not always, some form of spiritual practice. — location: [565](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=565) ^ref-8248

“work,” and then “gauge” your working life as a whole. We are assuming that there are things on your list that you are getting paid to do. This will include your nine-to-five job, and your second job if the first isn’t enough, and any consulting or advising you do, etc. If you are a regular volunteer in any organization, figure that in, too. If you are a homemaker, like Debbie, make sure you remember that raising children, providing home-cooked meals for your family, taking care of aging parents, and doing housework are all forms of “work.” — location: [606](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=606) ^ref-37135

Play is about activity that brings joy just for the pure sake of the doing of it. It can include organized activity or productive endeavors, but only if they are done for fun and not merit. — location: [617](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=617) ^ref-19983

forms. Our primary relationship is where we go first for love, children typically come next, and then it’s a flood of people and pets and community and anything else that is an object of affection. And it is as critical to feel loved by others as it is to love—it has to go both ways. Where is the love flowing in your life, from you and from others? — location: [630](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=630) ^ref-19928

Our goal for your life is rather simple: coherency. A coherent life is one lived in such a way that you can clearly connect the dots between three things: • Who you are • What you believe • What you are doing — location: [722](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=722) ^ref-29450

only thing worth pursuing, and your Workview tells you that it’s critical to make enough money so your kids have everything they need, you are going to make a compromise in your Lifeview while your children are dependent and at home. But that will be okay, because it’s a conscious decision, which allows you to stay “on course” and coherent. — location: [731](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=731) ^ref-48029

---
Living coherently doesn’t mean everything is in perfect order all the time. It simply means you are living in alignment with your values and have not sacrificed your integrity along the way. — location: [733](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=733) ^ref-33661

Michael wrote down when during the day he had been feeling bored, restless, or unhappy at his job, and what exactly he had been doing during those times (the times when he was disengaged). He also wrote down when he was excited, focused, and having a good time at work, and what exactly he was doing during those times (the times when he was engaged). Michael was working on what we call the Good Time Journal. — location: [867](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=867) ^ref-64732

Once you have a good handle on where your energy goes every week, you can start redesigning your activities to maximize your vitality. — location: [912](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=912) ^ref-57882

---
Remember, life design is about getting more out of your current life—and not only about redesigning a whole new life. Even if questions about some big change in your life may be what brought you to this book, most life design work is directed at tuning up and improving the life you’re in, without having to make huge structural changes like changing jobs or moving or going back to grad school. — location: [913](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=913) ^ref-7712

Dysfunctional Belief: I’m stuck. Reframe: I’m never stuck, because I can always generate a lot of ideas. — location: [1102](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=1102) ^ref-55264

She had spent a long time trying to do the right thing instead of doing what was right for Sharon. A year into her job search, she felt she was out of options. She felt defeated. But Sharon wasn’t really out of options—she just hadn’t come up with a lot of real options in the first place. — location: [1111](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=1111) ^ref-47934

So many people get stuck chasing their first idea, or the perfect idea, or that one big idea that will solve the problem, will be the answer, and will dig them out of whatever hole they are currently stuck in. That’s a lot of pressure. — location: [1130](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=1130) ^ref-15207

Designers learn to have lots of wild ideas because they know that the number one enemy of creativity is judgment. — location: [1150](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=1150) ^ref-65504

The crazy ideas may not be the ones we pick (and rarely are, actually), but often after having the crazy ideas, we have moved to a new creative space, — location: [1156](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=1156) ^ref-30277

As a life designer, you need to embrace two philosophies: 1. You choose better when you have lots of good ideas to choose from. 2. You never choose your first solution to any problem. — location: [1162](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=1162) ^ref-10024

Most often, our first solutions are pretty average and not very creative. Humans have a tendency to suggest the obvious first.

mind map. For this, you take the original idea and write down five or six things related to that idea. Be rigorous in writing down the first words that come to mind. Now repeat this process with the words in the second ring. Draw three or four lines from each word, and free-associate new words related to these prompts. The words that come up for you do not need to be associated to the words or question in the center, only the word in the second ring. Repeat this process until you have at least three or four rings of word associations. — location: [1193](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=1193) ^ref-47264

it’s not about finding the perfect job, it’s about making the job he has “perfect.” — location: [1216](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=1216) ^ref-49025

problems—the ones that just won’t go away—that we call anchor problems. — location: [1225](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=1225) ^ref-50077

Dave is anchored on this problem because he’s anchored to the one and only solution he’s been willing to accept—a perfect cars-plus-workshop layout. It’s such a huge job now, Dave doesn’t even — location: [1242](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=1242) ^ref-33194

Melanie believed that her problem was getting fifteen million dollars to fund her social innovation institute. But that wasn’t her problem; that was just her first idea of a solution to her problem, and she got so anchored to that idea that she was mired in stuckness and failure. — location: [1270](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=1270) ^ref-32932

when you anchor yourself to a bad solution, it just gets worse and worse with time. — location: [1274](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=1274) ^ref-27543

---
Don’t make a doable problem into an anchor problem by wedding yourself irretrievably to a solution that just isn’t working. Reframe the solution to some other possibilities, prototype those ideas (take some test hikes), and get yourself unstuck. — location: [1307](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=1307) ^ref-40396

---
Anchor problems are not only about our current, failed approach. They are really about the fear that, no matter what else we try, that won’t work either, and then we’ll have to admit that we’re permanently stuck—meaning we’re screwed—and we’d rather be stuck than screwed. — location: [1310](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=1310) ^ref-35182

---
The way forward is to reduce the risk (and the fear) of failure by designing a series of small prototypes to test the waters. — location: [1314](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=1314) ^ref-47971

It is okay for prototypes to fail—they are supposed to—but well-designed prototypes teach you something about the future. — location: [1315](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=1315) ^ref-34126

---
Prototypes lower your anxiety, ask interesting questions, and get you data about the potential of the change that you are trying to accomplish. One of the principles of design thinking is that you want to “fail fast and fail forward,” into your next step. — location: [1316](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=1316) ^ref-42407

---
When you’re stuck with an anchor problem, try reframing the challenge as an exploration of possibilities (instead of trying to solve your huge problem in one miraculous leap), then decide to try a series of small, safe prototypes of the change you’d like to see happen. — location: [1318](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=1318) ^ref-20785

Chung was making a very common mistake. He thought there was one best way to spend his life, and he had to know what it was or he’d be settling for second best—or worse. But that’s not true. We all contain enough energy and talents and interests to live many different types of lives, all of which could be authentic and interesting and productive. Asking which life is best is asking a silly question; it’s like asking whether it’s better to have hands or feet. — location: [1403](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=1403) ^ref-10321

Dysfunctional Belief: I need to figure out my best possible life, make a plan, and then execute it. Reframe: There are multiple great lives (and plans) within me, and I get to choose which one to build my way forward to next. — location: [1422](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=1422) ^ref-12946

even if you’re in a rush, we recommend you prototype your life ideas. You’ll get a better design and save a lot of time and difficulty. — location: [1707](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=1707) ^ref-56109

All of your hard work can be undone by poor choosing. Not so much by making the wrong choice (that’s a risk, but, frankly, not a big one, and usually one you can recover from) as by thinking wrongly about your choosing. — location: [2255](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=2255) ^ref-57677

Dysfunctional Belief: To be happy, I have to make the right choice. Reframe: There is no right choice—only good choosing. — location: [2260](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=2260) ^ref-41870

The fourth step in the process is to let go of our unnecessary options and move on, embracing our choice fully so that we can get the most from it. — location: [2271](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=2271) ^ref-6510

If you’ve got a list of twelve options, cross out seven, then rewrite your list with just the remaining five on — location: [2322](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=2322) ^ref-46022

you won’t cross off the wrong one. We call this the Pizza-Chinese Effect. We’ve all experienced it. Ed sticks his head in your office and says, “Hey, Paula—we’re going out for lunch. Wanna come?” “Sure!” “We’re choosing between pizza and Chinese food—got a preference?” “Nah—whatever’s good!” “Okay—we’re getting pizza.” “No, wait. I want Chinese!” In that situation, when you gave your first answer (“whatever’s good”), you thought you meant it. You didn’t know that you had a preference until an unwanted decision occurred as a fait accompli. Only after the choice was named did you become aware of your preference. So you really can’t lose when you’re shortening your list of options. If you cross out the wrong ones, you’ll know afterward. — location: [2326](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=2326) ^ref-49540

The most common reason is that you’re still just in agony over losing those seven other options and are refusing to let them go. If that’s the case, then do whatever — location: [2336](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=2336) ^ref-2548

decision. It is very important to have good information available—to do lots of homework and take lots of notes and make spreadsheets and comparisons and talk to experts, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But once that work is done—led by the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which runs the executive functions of coding, listing, and categorizing—we need access to that wisdom center where our well-informed emotional knowing can help us discern the better choices for us. — location: [2364](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=2364) ^ref-12404

Emotional, intuitive, and spiritual forms of knowing are usually subtle, quiet, and even shy. Rarely do people get access to their deepest wisdom by rushing around a few hours before a deadline and talking a lot — location: [2384](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=2384) ^ref-53140

---
Decision making is stressful, so the best time to prepare for good choosing is when there’s no choice at stake. That’s when you can invest in your emotional intelligence and spiritual maturity so that those muscles are strong and trained when it’s decision or game time. — location: [2388](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=2388) ^ref-35841

---
To grok a choice, you don’t think about it—you become it. Let’s say you’ve got three alternatives. Pick any one of them and stop thinking about it. Choose to think for the next one to three days that you are the person who has made the decision to pick Alternative A. Choice A is your reality right now. When you brush your teeth in the morning, you do so having chosen A. When you sit at a red light, you’re waiting to proceed toward your destination related to living in Alternative A. — location: [2399](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=2399) ^ref-24108

You can’t make “the best choice,” because you can’t know what that best choice was until all the consequences have played out. You can work on making the best choice you can, given what’s knowable at the moment, — location: [2424](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=2424) ^ref-36071

The perception that there are gazillions of possibilities that may have been great but that we never got to is a powerful force against being at peace with our choice making; — location: [2444](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=2444) ^ref-48683

Do yourself the favor of getting lots of options, then culling the list down to a short and manageable size (five max); then make the best choice that you can, given the time and resources available to you, get on with it, and build your way forward. — location: [2459](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=2459) ^ref-47655

Note that if you’re doing this with prototype iteration, you don’t have too much at stake, and you will be able to adjust as you go, before you really reach a significant investment. — location: [2461](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BJSRSEC&location=2461) ^ref-57332
