## Highlights
Sometimes I only needed someone to command me to initiate the action. In the strangest of my workarounds I could literally tell someone exactly what to tell me to do. I could then follow their commands to initiate actions that I couldn’t manage on my own. In the most baroque of these scenarios, I would call my friend Jake on the phone to have him get me unstuck. — location: [871](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TOLC&location=871) ^ref-5264

If I hold up my hands and ask you to pick one, you’ll have no trouble doing so. But here is the question: how did you choose? If you look closely, you’ll realize that in all cases, independent of whether you do any preliminary work, at some point magic happens. A decision floats up from the ether inside your brain and action follows: pointing, speaking, reaching, and so on. — location: [888](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TOLC&location=888) ^ref-8994

necessary. (All people, in certain circumstances, can operate purely on intuition and skip the “knowing” stage altogether: “I don’t know, just pick one and worry about it later!”) — location: [924](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TOLC&location=924) ^ref-35512

But this is the crucial step that is missing for the concussive with a fatigued brain: certainty never arises, the visual/spatial goal is never marked, and without a target the body cannot respond. No amount of inner dialogue from the “knowing” phase is of any help. — location: [928](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TOLC&location=928) ^ref-25565

missing that same elusive sense of certainty that drives the lower-level planning system so closely tied to motor control. — location: [943](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TOLC&location=943) ^ref-11057

In this way—as I experienced during my unsuccessful ER visits—concussives are often unable to articulate what is wrong with them. The cognitive machinery that is missing is also, exactly, the machinery necessary even to conceive of the machine itself. In the case of the apple, the capability was easily described and easily understood: there are two objects, or paths of action, so pick one. Thus, intellectually, I knew what a decision was. But—and this is important to understand—I had no visceral sense of what a decision was. I had no feeling for what led up to the making of a decision except that magic used to happen, and now it no longer did. — location: [959](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TOLC&location=959) ^ref-33017

For a concussive, no matter how long the list of identified cognitive deficits might become, there will still be hundreds of other small cognitive changes that are much less easy to define—though collectively they are perhaps even more important in the end. — location: [966](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TOLC&location=966) ^ref-15607

Another aspect of concussion that can be emotionally troubling is that the business of getting through the day just becomes so much work. As we’ve already seen in my own life, tasks that require any sort of visualization, or planning, or pattern matching, or balance, or decision making—in other words, more or less even the simplest things one might desire to do—become a struggle. — location: [986](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TOLC&location=986) ^ref-42963

In concussives, the filtering process itself is affected. Inappropriate daemons are continually triggered, needlessly searching for meaning in unfiltered minutiae. Concussives’ automatic sensory filters no longer work correctly, so the world has a tendency to become a nightmare of cognitive input that is “noticed,” and thus must be consciously filtered: the sound of a truck driving down the road outside is given the same initial importance as the sound of a question from your daughter, sitting in front of you, with whom you are having a conversation: — location: [1034](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TOLC&location=1034) ^ref-50783

---
Lastly—and very importantly—because low-level visual/spatial representations can be degraded in a concussive’s brain, daemons may not realize, so to speak, that their conditions for termination have been met—the match against current circumstances fails—and they just keep running, well beyond their useful life.* — location: [1046](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TOLC&location=1046) ^ref-4558

From the outside, it just appears that a concussive is quirky and unreasonable about the noise of garbage trucks and the need for quiet in the household. He is slow in responding to simple questions about car keys, and asking such questions can make him unaccountably distressed. This does not make much sense to others, who are not aware of the processing overload that is going on under the hood. You will often hear concussives complain that they “can only do one thing at a time.” And this is true. The sad fact, however, is that normal cognition, even when only doing one thing at a time on the surface, often requires many layers of simultaneous processing in the brain. — location: [1052](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TOLC&location=1052) ^ref-26581

day. Those dealing with concussives may, for this reason, find even the most naturally organized among them reluctant to make plans, to set dates, and to engage in activities such as scheduling their days. — location: [1501](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TOLC&location=1501) ^ref-57425

Lastly, an additional difficulty for a concussive may be in recognizing that a formerly future scene has now arrived. — location: [1520](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TOLC&location=1520) ^ref-52879

Once I had placed myself in rule-following mode it was difficult for me to make the transition out of it. By contrast, the healthy human brain can switch in and out of rule-following mode in the blink of an eye and with no effort whatsoever. — location: [2074](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TOLC&location=2074) ^ref-58996

day. In the end I became reluctant to make commitments, something that may be common among concussives. — location: [2263](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TOLC&location=2263) ^ref-23776
