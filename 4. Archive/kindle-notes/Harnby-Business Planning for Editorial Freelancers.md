## Highlights
graft. In your business plan, compile a list of all the clients you are going to contact. They should be relevant to your background and experience. Note the name of the organization, the types of material it publishes, and the name of the person to contact. Make a quick phone call if you don’t know the name of the person in charge of commissioning editorial services. My initial list had over 70 entries. Take time to research each client, even if there are lots of them. Make a note in your business plan of their specialist areas so that you can customize your contact message. Round-robin letters are less likely to get you noticed than tailored ones. — location: [506](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00C23DM5I&location=506) ^ref-37630

Another method is to offer to carry out a few free pieces of work for your target client groups. For example: ~ Small, independent publishers who can’t afford to contract out work to freelance copy-editors/proofreaders are a useful avenue to explore in order to garner experience. ~ You could offer to proofread a student thesis for free on a one-off basis by making contact with someone at your local university – perhaps via a competition. ~ Is there a local/parish magazine that you could offer to edit for a set period of time, at no cost? ~ Do you have friends who regularly write expansive business reports that you could offer to proofread? ~ Might you search online for Google+ hangouts where aspiring authors look for help at a token price? ~ Are there social networking sites that you can explore where you might pick up a few leads? ~ Can you make contact with a local business and offer to do gratis work on their website or some printed reports? ~ Is there a local charity whose aims you support and which might be grateful for some proofreading help? — location: [567](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00C23DM5I&location=567) ^ref-448
