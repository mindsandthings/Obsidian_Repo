## Highlights
using a framework that predefined morality as justice while denigrating authority, hierarchy, and tradition, it was inevitable that the research would support worldviews that were secular, questioning, and egalitarian. — location: [271](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=271) ^ref-49511

If you force kids to explain complex notions, such as how to balance competing concerns about rights and justice, you’re guaranteed to find age trends because kids get so much more articulate with each passing year. — location: [273](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=273) ^ref-41758

That was my first hint that groups create supernatural beings not to explain the universe but to order their societies. — location: [316](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=316) ^ref-7135

---
United States and Western Europe as extraordinary historical exceptions—new societies that had found a way to strip down and thin out the thick, all-encompassing moral orders that the anthropologists wrote about. — location: [327](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=327) ^ref-47615

---
Nowhere was this thinning more apparent than in our lack of rules about what the anthropologists call “purity” and “pollution.” — location: [328](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=328) ^ref-5755

---
Turiel would call these rules social conventions, because the Hua don’t believe that men in other tribes have to follow these rules. But the Hua certainly seemed to think of their food rules as moral rules. — location: [332](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=332) ^ref-24481

---
Liberals sometimes say that religious conservatives are sexual prudes for whom anything other than missionary-position intercourse within marriage is a sin. But conservatives can just as well make fun of liberal struggles to choose a balanced breakfast—balanced among moral concerns about free-range eggs, fair-trade coffee, naturalness, and a variety of toxins, some of which (such as genetically modified corn and soybeans) pose a greater threat spiritually than biologically. — location: [347](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=347) ^ref-10866

---
all societies must resolve a small set of questions about how to order society, the most important being how to balance the needs of individuals and groups. There seem to be just two primary ways of answering this question. — location: [365](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=365) ^ref-25323

Shweder found almost no trace of social conventional thinking in the sociocentric culture of Orissa, where, as he put it, “the social order is a moral order.” Morality was much broader and thicker in Orissa; almost any practice could be loaded up with moral force. And if that was true, then Turiel’s theory became less plausible. Children were not figuring out morality for themselves, based on the bedrock certainty that harm is bad. — location: [391](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=391) ^ref-56699

Americans predictably said that those cases were fine. But more important, they didn’t see these behaviors as social conventions that could be changed by popular consent. — location: [410](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=410) ^ref-4346

---
The distinction between morals and mere conventions is not a tool that children everywhere use to self-construct their moral knowledge. Rather, the distinction turns out to be a cultural artifact, a necessary by-product of the individualistic answer to the question of how individuals and groups relate. — location: [413](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=413) ^ref-44476

If you want to give people a quick flash of revulsion but deprive them of any victim they can use to justify moral condemnation, ask them about people who do disgusting or disrespectful things, but make sure the actions are done in private so that nobody else is offended. — location: [438](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=438) ^ref-50754

Unexpectedly, the effect of social class was much larger than the effect of city. In other words, well-educated people in all three cities were more similar to each other than they were to their lower-class neighbors. I had flown five thousand miles south to search for moral variation when in fact there was more to be found a few blocks west of campus, in the poor neighborhood surrounding my university. — location: [487](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=487) ^ref-63026

They seemed to be morally dumbfounded—rendered speechless by their inability to explain verbally what they knew intuitively.29 — location: [538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=538) ^ref-39798

These subjects were reasoning. They were working quite hard at reasoning. But it was not reasoning in search of truth; it was reasoning in support of their emotional reactions. It was reasoning as described by the philosopher David Hume, who wrote in 1739 that “reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.”30 — location: [540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=540) ^ref-26197

To be human is to feel pulled in different directions, and to marvel—sometimes in horror—at your inability to control your own actions. — location: [570](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=570) ^ref-20936

---
chimps (and other apes) have most of the psychological building blocks that humans use to construct moral systems and communities. These building blocks are largely emotional, such as feelings of sympathy, fear, anger, and affection. — location: [677](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=677) ^ref-27934

---
Yet moral judgments are not subjective statements; they are claims that somebody did something wrong. I can’t call for the community to punish you simply because I don’t like what you’re doing. I have to point to something outside of my own preferences, and that pointing is our moral reasoning. We do moral reasoning not to reconstruct the actual reasons why we ourselves came to a judgment; we reason to find the best possible reasons why somebody else ought to join us in our judgment.36 — location: [859](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=859) ^ref-34065

Emotions are a kind of information processing.39 Contrasting emotion with cognition is therefore as pointless as contrasting rain with weather, or cars with vehicles. — location: [876](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=876) ^ref-32360

Once human beings developed language and began to use it to gossip about each other, it became extremely valuable for elephants to carry around on their backs a full-time public relations firm.42 — location: [897](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=897) ^ref-54404

The dots mean that independently reasoned judgment is possible in theory but rare in practice. This simple change converted the model into a Humean model in which intuition (rather than passion) is the main cause of moral judgment (link 1), — location: [902](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=902) ^ref-46545

When I do make a reasoned change to my moral judgement, I do it by finding a different viscerally motivating story or perspective and intentionally attaching to that one instead of the earlier one

Moral talk serves a variety of strategic purposes such as managing your reputation, building alliances, and recruiting bystanders to support your side in the disputes that are so common in daily life. — location: [906](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=906) ^ref-4342

are dreadful at seeking out evidence that might disconfirm those initial judgments.43 Yet friends can do for us what we cannot do for ourselves: they can challenge us, giving us reasons and arguments (link 3) that sometimes trigger new intuitions, thereby making it possible for us to change our minds. — location: [914](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=914) ^ref-10457

We occasionally do this when mulling a problem by ourselves, suddenly seeing things in a new light or from a new perspective (to use two visual metaphors). Link 6 in the model represents this process of private reflection. — location: [916](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=916) ^ref-5600

intuitions (including emotional responses) are a kind of cognition. They’re just not a kind of reasoning. — location: [930](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=930) ^ref-6037

you might think his techniques are superficial and manipulative, appropriate only for salespeople. But Carnegie was in fact a brilliant moral psychologist who grasped one of the deepest truths about conflict. He used a quotation from Henry Ford to express it: “If there is any one secret of success it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from their angle as well as your own.”50 — location: [944](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=944) ^ref-60789

Empathy is an antidote to righteousness, although it’s very difficult to empathize across a moral divide. — location: [953](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=953) ^ref-25633

You can feel affective primacy in action the next time you run into someone you haven’t seen in many years. You’ll usually know within a second or two whether you liked or disliked the person, but it can take much longer to remember who the person is or how you know each other. — location: [1039](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1039) ^ref-33354

The rider is an attentive servant, always trying to anticipate the elephant’s next move. If the elephant leans even slightly to the left, as though preparing to take a step, the rider looks to the left and starts preparing to assist the elephant on its imminent leftward journey. The rider loses interest in everything off to the right. — location: [1056](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1056) ^ref-34507

---
In other words, there’s a two-way street between our bodies and our righteous minds. Immorality makes us feel physically dirty, and cleansing ourselves can sometimes make us more concerned about guarding our moral purity. — location: [1142](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1142) ^ref-52079

At the end of the experiment, the helper and hinderer puppets were placed on a tray in front of the infants. The infants were much more likely to reach out for the helper. — location: [1193](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1193) ^ref-34297

stunning example of consilience. Wilson had prophesied in 1975 that ethics would soon be “biologicized” and refounded as the interpretation of the activity of the “emotive centers” of the brain. — location: [1243](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1243) ^ref-46122

---
most of us can think of times when we questioned and revised our first intuitive judgment. The rider-and-elephant metaphor works well here. The rider evolved to serve the elephant, but it’s a dignified partnership, more like a lawyer serving a client than a slave serving a master. — location: [1254](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1254) ^ref-43795

---
The main way that we change our minds on moral issues is by interacting with other people. We are terrible at seeking evidence that challenges our own beliefs, but other people do us this favor, just as we are quite good at finding errors in other people’s beliefs. When discussions are hostile, the odds of change are slight. The elephant leans away from the opponent, and the rider works frantically to rebut the opponent’s charges. But if there is affection, admiration, or a desire to please the other person, then the elephant leans toward that person and the rider tries to find the truth in the other person’s arguments. — location: [1260](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1260) ^ref-11963

abortion and other controversial issues. Depending on which victim, which argument, or which friend you are thinking about at a given moment, your judgment may flip back and forth as if you were looking at a Necker cube (figure 3.1). — location: [1269](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1269) ^ref-1091

But Paxton and Greene added a twist to the experiment: some subjects were not allowed to respond right away. The computer forced them to wait for two minutes before they could declare their judgment about Julie and Mark. For these subjects the elephant leaned, but quick affective flashes don’t last for two minutes. While the subject was sitting there staring at the screen, the lean diminished and the rider had the time and freedom to think about the supporting argument. People who were forced to reflect on the weak argument still ended up condemning Julie and Mark—slightly more than people who got to answer immediately. But people who were forced to reflect on the good argument for two minutes actually did become substantially more tolerant toward Julie and Mark’s decision to have sex. The delay allowed the rider to think for himself and to decide upon a judgment that for many subjects was contrary to the elephant’s initial inclination. — location: [1283](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1283) ^ref-556

the most important principle for designing an ethical society is to make sure that everyone’s reputation is on the line all the time, so that bad behavior will always bring bad consequences. — location: [1350](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1350) ^ref-4392

Accountability increases exploratory thought only when three conditions apply: (1) decision makers learn before forming any opinion that they will be accountable to an audience, (2) the audience’s views are unknown, and (3) they believe the audience is well informed and interested in accuracy. — location: [1387](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1387) ^ref-12904

when we want to believe something, we ask ourselves, “Can I believe it?”28 Then (as Kuhn and Perkins found), we search for supporting evidence, and if we find even a single piece of pseudo-evidence, we can stop thinking. We now have permission to believe. We have a justification, in case anyone asks. — location: [1528](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1528) ^ref-9282

I’m not saying we should all stop reasoning and go with our gut feelings. Gut feelings are sometimes better guides than reasoning for making consumer choices and interpersonal judgments,52 but they are often disastrous as a basis for public policy, science, and law.53 Rather, what I’m saying is that we must be wary of any individual’s ability to reason. We should see each individual as being limited, like a neuron. A neuron is really good at one thing: summing up the stimulation coming into its dendrites to “decide” whether to fire a pulse along its axon. A neuron by itself isn’t very smart. But if you put neurons together in the right way you get a brain; you get an emergent system that is much smarter and more flexible than a single neuron. — location: [1637](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1637) ^ref-13184

WEIRD people are statistical outliers; they are the least typical, least representative people you could study if you want to make generalizations about human nature.

I’ll set aside the question of whether any of these alternative moralities are really good, true, or justifiable. As an intuitionist, I believe it is a mistake to even raise that emotionally powerful question until we’ve calmed our elephants and cultivated some understanding of what such moralities are trying to accomplish. — location: [1741](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1741) ^ref-10156

I used Shweder’s theory to analyze the justifications people gave (when I asked them “Can you tell me why?”), and it worked like magic. The Penn students spoke almost exclusively in the language of the ethic of autonomy, whereas the other groups (particularly the working-class groups) made much more use of the ethic of community, — location: [1786](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1786) ^ref-32654

---
Rather than automatically rejecting the men as sexist oppressors and pitying the women, children, and servants as helpless victims, I began to see a moral world in which families, not individuals, are the basic unit of society, and the members of each extended family (including its servants) are intensely interdependent. In this world, equality and personal autonomy were not sacred values. Honoring elders, gods, and guests, protecting subordinates, and fulfilling one’s role-based duties were more important. — location: [1810](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1810) ^ref-35946

If these new feelings were just a new ability to detect invisible dirt rays emanating from objects, they would have helped me to understand obsessive-compulsive disorder, but not morality. These feelings were more than that. In the ethic of divinity, there is an order to the universe, and things (as well as people) should be treated with the reverence or disgust that they deserve. — location: [1856](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1856) ^ref-7652

The human body does not suddenly become an object, like that of any other animal corpse, at the moment of death.

---
I could see the dark side of this ethic too: once you allow visceral feelings of disgust to guide your conception of what God wants, then minorities who trigger even a hint of disgust in the majority (such as homosexuals or obese people) can be ostracized and treated cruelly. The ethic of divinity is sometimes incompatible with compassion, egalitarianism, and basic human rights.23 — location: [1876](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1876) ^ref-60161

---
The ethic of divinity lets us give voice to inchoate feelings of elevation and degradation—our sense of “higher” and “lower.” It gives us a way to condemn crass consumerism and mindless or trivialized sexuality. We can understand long-standing laments about the spiritual emptiness of a consumer society in which everyone’s mission is to satisfy their personal desires.24 — location: [1885](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1885) ^ref-1945

I began to see that many moral matrices coexist within each nation. Each matrix provides a complete, unified, and emotionally compelling worldview, easily justified by observable evidence and nearly impregnable to attack by arguments from outsiders. — location: [1899](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1899) ^ref-61244

Social conservatives think that welfare programs and feminism increase rates of single motherhood and weaken the traditional social structures that compel men to support their own children? Well, now that I was no longer on the defensive, I could see that those arguments made sense, even if there are also many good effects of liberating women from dependence on men. — location: [1926](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1926) ^ref-19853

Yet the conceptions held by others are available to us, in the sense that when we truly understand their conception of things we come to recognize possibilities latent within our own rationality … and those ways of conceiving of things become salient for us for the first time, or once again.

Neither Shweder nor I am saying that “anything goes,” or that all societies or all cuisines are equally good.

couldn’t just point to features of morality that seemed universal—such as compassion and reciprocity—and assert that they were innate merely because they were found everywhere.

universal moral “taste receptors” would look like. They would be adaptations to long-standing threats and opportunities in social life.

outcome. If you are a Kantian, you’d also give the older nurse no extra credit. She seems to have acted absentmindedly, or (even worse, for Kant) she acted on her feelings. She did not act out of commitment to a universalizable principle. But if you are a Humean, then it is perfectly proper for you to like and praise the older nurse. She has so fully acquired the virtue of caring that she does it automatically and effortlessly, even when it has no effect.

now we know that traits can be innate without being either hardwired or universal.

The brain is like a book, the first draft of which is written by the genes during fetal development.

Human authority, then, is not just raw power backed by the threat of force. Human authorities take on responsibility for maintaining order and justice. Of course, authorities often exploit their subordinates for their own benefit while believing they are perfectly just. But if we want to understand how human civilizations burst forth and covered the Earth in just a few thousand years, we’ll have to look closely at the role of authority in creating moral order. — location: [2440](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=2440) ^ref-52280

The current triggers of the Authority/subversion foundation, therefore, include anything that is construed as an act of obedience, disobedience, respect, disrespect, submission, or rebellion, with regard to authorities perceived to be legitimate. Current triggers also include acts that are seen to subvert the traditions, institutions, or values that are perceived to provide stability. As with the Loyalty foundation, it is much easier for the political right to build on this foundation than it is for the left, which often defines itself in part by its opposition to hierarchy, inequality, and power. — location: [2462](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=2462) ^ref-11697

The original adaptive challenge that drove the evolution of the Sanctity foundation, therefore, was the need to avoid pathogens, parasites, and other threats that spread by physical touch or proximity.

The Sanctity foundation makes it easy for us to regard some things as “untouchable,” both in a bad way (because something is so dirty or polluted we want to stay away) and in a good way (because something is so hallowed, so sacred, that we want to protect it from desecration). If we had no sense of disgust, I believe we would also have no sense of the sacred. And if you think, as I do, that one of the greatest unsolved mysteries is how people ever came together to form large cooperative societies, then you might take a special interest in the psychology of sacredness. — location: [2531](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=2531) ^ref-53320

Boehm’s claim is that at some point during the last half-million years, well after the advent of language, our ancestors created the first true moral communities.32 In these communities, people used gossip to identify behavior they didn’t like, particularly the aggressive, dominating behaviors of would-be alpha males.

In a similar way, early humans domesticated themselves when they began to select friends and partners based on their ability to live within the tribe’s moral matrix. In fact, our brains, bodies, and behavior show many of the same signs of domestication that are found in our domestic animals: smaller teeth, smaller body, reduced aggression, and greater playfulness, carried on even into adulthood.72 The reason is that domestication generally takes traits that disappear at the end of childhood and keeps them turned on for life. Domesticated animals (including humans) are more childlike, sociable, and gentle than their wild ancestors. — location: [3526](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=3526) ^ref-33336

Group selection does not require war or violence. Whatever traits make a group more efficient at procuring food and turning it into children makes that group more fit than its neighbors.

My definition of morality was designed to be a descriptive definition; it cannot stand alone as a normative definition.

But I think my definition works well as an adjunct to other normative theories, particularly those that have often had difficulty seeing groups and social facts. Utilitarians since Jeremy Bentham have focused intently on individuals. They try to improve the welfare of society by giving individuals what they want. But a Durkheimian version of utilitarianism would recognize that human flourishing requires social order and embeddedness. It would begin with the premise that social order is extraordinarily precious and difficult to achieve. A Durkheimian utilitarianism would be open to the possibility that the binding foundations—Loyalty, Authority, and Sanctity—have a crucial role to play in a good society. — location: [4526](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=4526) ^ref-8632

These narratives are not necessarily true stories—they are simplified and selective reconstructions of the past, often connected to an idealized vision of the future. But even though life narratives are to some degree post hoc fabrications, they still influence people’s behavior, relationships, and mental health.24 — location: [4695](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=4695) ^ref-28056

When faced with questions such as “One of the worst things a person could do is hurt a defenseless animal” or “Justice is the most important requirement for a society,” liberals assumed that conservatives would disagree. If you have a moral matrix built primarily on intuitions about care and fairness (as equality), and you listen to the Reagan narrative, what else could you think? Reagan seems completely unconcerned about the welfare of drug addicts, poor people, and gay people. He’s more interested in fighting wars and telling people how to run their sex lives. — location: [4787](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=4787) ^ref-24357

This is... True. Liberals may not predict how conservators would answer but they predict how they ACT. it's valuable to understand how people think about themselves but let's not pretend it's liberal ignorance here

What makes social and political arguments conservative as opposed to orthodox is that the critique of liberal or progressive arguments takes place on the enlightened grounds of the search for human happiness based on the use of reason. — location: [4821](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=4821) ^ref-3335

As a lifelong liberal, I had assumed that conservatism = orthodoxy = religion = faith = rejection of science. It followed, therefore, that as an atheist and a scientist, I was obligated to be a liberal. But Muller asserted that modern conservatism is really about creating the best possible society, the one that brings about the greatest happiness given local circumstances. Could it be? Was there a kind of conservatism that could compete against liberalism in the court of social science? Might conservatives have a better formula for how to create a healthy, happy society? — location: [4824](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=4824) ^ref-28304

Okay, fine, as long as you acknowledge that these people have no power and their morals have been coopted purely for exploitation

Everyone loves social capital. Whether you’re left, right, or center, who could fail to see the value of being able to trust and rely upon others? But now let’s broaden our focus beyond firms trying to produce goods and let’s think about a school, a commune, a corporation, or even a whole nation that wants to improve moral behavior. Let’s set aside problems of moral diversity and just specify the goal as increasing the “output” of prosocial behaviors and decreasing the “output” of antisocial behaviors, however the group defines those terms. To achieve almost any moral vision, you’d probably want high levels of social capital. (It’s hard to imagine how anomie and distrust could be beneficial.) But will linking people together into healthy, trusting relationships be enough to improve the ethical profile of the group? — location: [4855](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=4855) ^ref-44348

Let me state clearly that moral capital is not always an unalloyed good. Moral capital leads automatically to the suppression of free riders, but it does not lead automatically to other forms of fairness such as equality of opportunity. And while high moral capital helps a community to function efficiently, the community can use that efficiency to inflict harm on other communities. High moral capital can be obtained within a cult or a fascist nation, as long as most people truly accept the prevailing moral matrix. — location: [4898](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=4898) ^ref-19816

Nonetheless, if you are trying to change an organization or a society and you do not consider the effects of your changes on moral capital, you’re asking for trouble. — location: [4902](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=4902) ^ref-58827

I’m willing to run this risk, however, because I want to show that public policy might really be improved by drawing on insights from all sides. — location: [4925](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=4925) ^ref-31116

ok but you also need to convince me that the conservatism you cite is actually one of the sides in the debate

For American liberals since the 1960s, I believe that the most sacred value is caring for victims of oppression. Anyone who blames such victims for their own problems or who displays or merely excuses prejudice against sacralized victim groups can expect a vehement tribal response.48 — location: [4941](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=4941) ^ref-19203

On the Moral Foundations Questionnaire, libertarians join liberals in scoring very low on the Loyalty, Authority, and Sanctity foundations. Where they diverge from liberals most sharply is on two measures: the Care foundation, where they score very low (even lower than conservatives), and on some new questions we added about economic liberty, where they score extremely high (a little higher than conservatives, a lot higher than liberals). — location: [5038](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=5038) ^ref-60537

A more positive way to describe conservatives is to say that their broader moral matrix allows them to detect threats to moral capital that liberals cannot perceive. — location: [5102](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=5102) ^ref-56291

our “parochial altruism” is part of what makes us such great team players. We need groups, we love groups, and we develop our virtues in groups, even though those groups necessarily exclude nonmembers. If you destroy all groups and dissolve all internal structure, you destroy your moral capital. — location: [5129](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=5129) ^ref-7886

Other structural changes that might reduce Manichaeism include changing the ways that primary elections are run, the ways that electoral districts are drawn, and the ways that candidates raise money for their campaigns.

If you want to understand another group, follow the sacredness. As a first step, think about the six moral foundations, and try to figure out which one or two are carrying the most weight in a particular controversy. And if you really want to open your mind, open your heart first. If you can have at least one friendly interaction with a member of the “other” group, you’ll find it far easier to listen to what they’re saying, and maybe even see a controversial issue in a new light. You may not agree, but you’ll probably shift from Manichaean disagreement to a more respectful and constructive yin-yang disagreement. — location: [5210](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=5210) ^ref-46508

Beware of anyone who insists that there is one true morality for all people, times, and places—particularly if that morality is founded upon a single moral foundation. Human societies are complex; their needs and challenges are variable. Our minds contain a toolbox of psychological systems, including the six moral foundations, which can be used to meet those challenges and construct effective moral communities. — location: [5256](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=5256) ^ref-35831
