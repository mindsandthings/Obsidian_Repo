## Highlights
Stopping them requires two things: 1) Awareness of their action/purpose 2) Stronger rope guards That’s what we’re going to do in this book. I want to bring awareness to the letters (their content), to the presence of those messengers, and to the button-pusher. Because we want to strengthen our rope guards. That is the goal. — location: [268](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=268) ^ref-31173

Whenever you hear someone talking about numbers in any kind of author presentation, non-fiction book, or advertisement, always ask yourself first: (1) is this a credible source—what’s at stake for them to make the numbers come out in their favor; and (2) is it reasonable, based on even just my own experience, to think that there is another way to organize this data? And — location: [437](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=437) ^ref-62058

---
if you are a person who is overwhelmed whenever we start talking math, then never let yourself make a decision in the moment where numbers are concerned. Always put a pin in it, give yourself the time to process through the data in your own way. Don’t fall prey to “this person has to know what they’re talking about” logic. Walk away from the advert, or from the presentation, or from the webinar, or from the conversation, and give yourself the space to get out of fight-or-flight math adrenaline mode. — location: [442](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=442) ^ref-38586

at least make a contract with yourself that, for one week, you will question the premise whenever you start to beat up on yourself. Just for one week. When you start to hear the negative self-talk, just ask yourself, “But is it? But should I? But will they?” Just question the premise. — location: [578](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=578) ^ref-42073

Some of the You. Are. Wrong. letters that we get are just too strong, and they come from places that are too inaccessible. If this is you, then know that there are multiple ways to run ads. Not everyone has to run ads with spreadsheets and data. If it overwhelms you, don’t worry about it. Minimize it to the lowest common denominator you can handle. Worry only about the important data: sales and spend. You can do everything else by instinct if you want.

The problem is, it is that hard for some people. And it’s their money. If they can’t pay someone and can’t figure out a data-heavy system, then let them worry about the metrics they can handle. The truth is, that’s what they’re going to do anyway, when they get overwhelmed. And on top of it, they’ll feel stupid for not being able to understand whatever “easy” system you’re using. If they make more than they spend (most of the time) and they’re okay with that, then who are we to tell them they can’t do it? — location: [808](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=808) ^ref-7879

No one can deny that one of the most important factors to "pleasing" the "algorithms" right now is speed of production. A few years ago, the speed was six a year. Then it was nine. Then it was twelve. Now, in 2019, it's closer to eighteen or twenty. And guess what? This is only going to get faster. Next year, it will be 24, without hesitation. It's not going to slow down (unless there is a **major** shift in reader habits, which is always possible). — location: [863](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=863) ^ref-20836

No, you don't need to write twelve books a year. If you're going to play that game, you need to write twenty-four. But you also can't write twenty-four books a year without doing things differently than you've ever thought they could be done before. And even if you could write twenty-four, then next year, you're gonna have to write thirty. So, at some point, you're going to be out of runway, dear writer. — location: [876](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=876) ^ref-54338

a good majority of people who are “scared” of indie publishing have a very fine sense for the sheer amount of risk involved in self-publishing. A healthy fear of things that rely on “luck” is just that. Healthy. — location: [920](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=920) ^ref-13942

If you go in planning to lose money, then you're surprised if you make money. Pleasantly surprised. But you're never disappointed that you expected to do poorly and then did poorly. And most importantly of all, you haven't bet your livelihood on it. — location: [960](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=960) ^ref-27541

When you have to create something out of nothing, and it's dependent only on your ability to have quiet, creative brain space, then you cannot treat those jobs the same. So, when something happens that blocks your creativity, it's similar to going on disability from a physical labor job. Your brain is your work. When something messes with your brain, it messes with your ability to create something out of nothing. — location: [1002](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=1002) ^ref-63020

There are writer brains out there who need significantly more thinking time than other writer brains. They need to process, sometimes for days or weeks, before they can put words on paper. And sometimes, they get stuck for days or weeks because something hasn't been puzzled out yet. This is not a deficiency. It is not a lack of appropriate planning. It is a Strength behavior. This might be a sign that your brain is doing what it's supposed to do, if you are wired for this. — location: [1529](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=1529) ^ref-44932

---
There are absolutely people who need the process time who can write almost every day. They tend to get good incubation time for their thoughts to move (driving, walking, running, showering, doing rote household tasks, playing certain kinds of rote games). It's not out of the realm of possibility that you might still write most days, even if you need this process. But there's a difference between "writing every time there are words ready" and "writing every single day, no matter what." — location: [1538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=1538) ^ref-18920

---
And of course, because there are some people who thrive on writing every day, let me say: if you are wired to be more disciplined or consistent, then you will thrive on writing every day. And if there are things standing in the way of you being able to do that, then I would strategically attack those things so you can get more consistency. — location: [1542](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=1542) ^ref-25892

---
Make a streak calendar. See, for yourself, what happens if you get a streak of days in a row. And then if you hit a day where you need to think instead of write, make a different color streak. Make sure you are getting that thinking time in, even if it's that subconscious incubation (doing something else with your conscious brain at the time). Don't fill all your spaces with input (classes, podcasts, research, etc.). If you need the time to think, take it. — location: [1549](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=1549) ^ref-4497

---
You type the wrong sentence and you get an essential pain hit. You want to go back and fix that sentence. If you keep writing, you will think about that sentence (and probably keep looking back at it). You’ll find yourself going back and reading sections to make sure they’re right. You’re getting the tracks laid so the train can keep moving forward. — location: [1594](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=1594) ^ref-34751

---
When you have certain personality traits that make you more emotionally receptive to the thoughts and feelings of other people, there is a tendency toward confusion about what’s really important to you. The more certain someone else feels about what everyone’s priorities “should” be, the more easily it is for you to adopt those priorities. When someone believes very strongly that “all good writers write fast,” it’s easy for you to take on that mantle because of their strong feelings. — location: [1619](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=1619) ^ref-60844

---
you may have to constantly check in with yourself and make sure that the priorities you’re setting are actually yours, and not someone else’s. — location: [1626](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=1626) ^ref-35161

if you process by talking, then you're going to spend too much time talking with no linear progression. What this looks like is: you’re going along, dictating dialogue, and then you get to a transitional sentence, and you have a hard time seeing what should happen next. Your instinct is to say something out loud like, “I’m not sure what will happen here—they need to move from the factory to the police station, and maybe I don’t need to write that at all. Maybe I can just say, they arrived at the police station.” It’s like you have to talk through what you’re seeing before you can “write” the narrative. You’re processing. The more often you have to do this, the harder dictation will be. — location: [1635](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=1635) ^ref-49319

Most of you who fall on the "external" side of the story process will have some version of the following in your history. * You plot out loud. * You call a friend when you're stuck and talk through your plot or character. * You don't know whether your book has landed or not until someone reads it. * You can only see your story structure when the story is finished.

utilize verbal planning as part of your dictation prep (before you dictate, you do one of the four things above). Even then, it might be hard to get the actual words of the manuscript to come out right because your tendency to verbally process will create a start-and-stop dictation style that might not make you any faster. — location: [1646](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=1646) ^ref-28361

---
Try two things. First, open your manuscript before you open anything else on your computer (or phone--no reaching for the phone in the morning). You don't have to write yet if the words aren't there, but if the words are there, write as many as will come out. Don't worry about word count. Second, go for a walk or a drive or take a long shower before you write words. There's a good chance that the reason you're struggling to get words on the page is that you haven't processed the story enough yet, so it's not ready to come out. — location: [1651](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=1651) ^ref-57993

If you don't know whether or not signings will get you to what you want out of your author career, use some of these discussion points above and journal about it. What will make you look back, in ten years, and think, "this author signing was worth it?" And then look at how likely you are for that to happen. Know thyself, dear writer. — location: [1798](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=1798) ^ref-32408

when we see other authors doing something that seems to be helpful, one of our subconscious behaviors is looking for the norms of that group. We want to be a professional author. We want to belong to this group that we care about. When we see someone else talking about their assistant, we subconsciously decide that one of the characteristics of being an author is having an assistant, so we think we need one of those as well. — location: [1830](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=1830) ^ref-64444

you don't have to prove you are a real author. You just are one. Are you writing books? Have you written books? Then you're an author. You don't need any other accoutrements to prove it. — location: [1837](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=1837) ^ref-50022

When there's a job you can't do yourself, or you can't do without damage to your writing. Many of us get sucked into social media in a way that is so destructive, it's actually not worth the return on investment of our time. Many of us can't run our own advertising campaigns without significant stress. Some of us are not math-inclined and we can't do our own receipt work, or we need someone externally holding us accountable to turn things in (otherwise we get stressed around tax time). Some of us really can't be in our own inboxes. We get so caught up in all the things there are to do to keep up with the author business, we need someone to manage that for us. None of these things are uncommon. If it's going to get you more writing time or more thinking time to process those books, and you are financially able, then it's worth hiring out for this. — location: [1865](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=1865) ^ref-9174

If you're not getting more writing done because of the assistant, or you're not able to get ads run because of them, or you're not able to get admin done quicker, then it's not worth it. — location: [1879](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=1879) ^ref-41601

It’s because of wiring. You’re telling yourself that you're wrong so you'll conform with a subconscious norm. And what we’ve learned so far is that awareness of this little messenger / rope / guard / button-pusher scenario is one of the most important things you can start to be aware of now. — location: [2002](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=2002) ^ref-9137

1) Strengthen the rope guards. Get them some tools or skills that will help them manage the stimulus. This might be a program like Bright Line Eating (which helps me understand sugar and flour addiction), and is extremely skills based. It might be something like EBT (which helps me deal with the emotional part). There are several ways to add skills to—or strengthen—those rope guards. — location: [2045](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=2045) ^ref-52512

---
2) Change the environment so the letters don’t get written. Take the sugar out of the environment so I can’t choose to eat it. (Of course, I’ll still need help with skills because I’m going to have cravings. And I still might need a program. — location: [2048](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=2048) ^ref-4133

---
But if you substitute something like “distractibility” here, you can still do those two things. 1) Strengthen those rope guards: Use the Freedom app or a Pomodoro timer when you’re on social media or in email. 2) Change the environment so it’s not triggering the letters. Don’t use your phone first thing in the morning. Open your manuscript instead of your browser first thing in the morning. You either strengthen the rope guards, or you change the triggers. Those are the easiest ways to deal with this process. — location: [2050](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=2050) ^ref-62322

When the brain is triggering a You. Are. Wrong. letter that’s unhelpful, we want to do our best to open that letter before it crosses from subconscious to conscious. Be aware. Some of them are still going to get through. That's okay. You can't have 100% compliance. If you stop even one letter from getting through, that means you're more likely to stop two tomorrow. It's a numbers game. If you, on the other hand, become aware of the You. Are. Wrong. letters getting across your velvet rope, and you do nothing to stop any of them, then you're more likely to keep letting them through, but now you also feel guilty about letting them through. — location: [2074](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=2074) ^ref-1678

The rope guard is asleep or drinking bourbon or watching a pretty girl in a red dress, and BAM! Letter to the button-pusher. Delivered to Charlie quadrant. Now the guilt-emotion of "I am a bad writer because I am not plotting my books" gets soothed with, "PLOT THAT BOOK!" and the guilt goes away. Problem solved. But is it? If the Boss is not a plotter, then no, the problem is not solved. The emotion triggered a response, but the response was the wrong one. This is a You. Are. Wrong. letter we want to stop at the rope, before it gets to the button-pusher. What we’ve done in this book is look at some of these letters that are getting written, and tried to deconstruct whether they’re letters that belong across your rope or not. Are they worth letting your button-pusher open them? That’s the question. Regarding the “you must plot!” letter. Many of you have already decided this is not a good letter for your button-pusher to get. You’ve already developed a stronger or more alert rope guard in this area. Your guard is now fully awake and fully on the lookout for that letter coming across again. Your rope guard is strong enough to stop even the most experty-of-experts from crossing that border with one of those you-should-plot-your-books letters. They are on it. — location: [2084](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X31WXLY&location=2084) ^ref-7624
