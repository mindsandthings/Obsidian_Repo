## Highlights
description of paratextuality: "liminal devices and conventions, both within the book (peritext) and outside it (epitext), that mediate the book to the reader: titles and subtitles, pseudonyms, forewords, dedications, epigraphs, prefaces, intertitles, notes, epilogues, and afterwords" (xviii). Nicholas Basbanes (2003, 229) provides an enhanced list of paratexts: "titles, illustrations, dust jackets, indexes, appendices, paper, type design, and bindings." The paratexts all contribute to how a book is received. — location: [129](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=129) ^ref-64383

---
the main issue for the paratext is not to `look nice' around the text but rather to ensure for the text a destiny consistent with the author's purpose" — location: [133](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=133) ^ref-12457

---
As paratext, the book index bridges a gap between author and reader. It reconciles the vocabulary of the reader with that of the author. — location: [135](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=135) ^ref-39314

---
Whereas the Glossary provides a shallow, topical view of the content, and the Table of Contents provides a logical, structured view, a good index provides an intellectual view of the content unavailable by any other means. It is the result of an intelligent reading by an indexer trained in recognizing and documenting the interrelationships of the intellectual content; the indexer not only notes topics and subtopics, but also makes judgments about them, selecting the most important and relevant sections to direct readers to.

In the United States, the National Information Standards Organization defines an index as "a systematic guide designed to indicate topics or features of documents in order to facilitate retrieval of documents or parts of documents" (Anderson and NISO 1997, 39). — location: [146](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=146) ^ref-6258

---
The International Organization for Standardizations ISO 999 (1996) defines an index as an "alphabetically or otherwise ordered arrangement of entries, different from the order of the document or collection indexed, designed to enable users to locate information in a document or specific documents in a collection' (3.5). — location: [148](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=148) ^ref-30442

The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) takes us back to the Latin root index (n), the forefinger; index (v), to point out. The OED devotes many column inches to the various meanings of the word index, both as a noun and as a verb. For more on the history and meaning of index, see the fascinating discussion "Index: The Word, Its History and Meanings," provided by Hans Wellisch in his Indexingfrom A to Z (1995,199-210). — location: [149](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=149) ^ref-61478

---
I myself find the following definition useful: An index is a structured sequence-resulting from a thorough and complete analysis of text-of synthesized access points to all the information contained in the text. The structured arrangement of the index enables users to locate information efficiently. — location: [159](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=159) ^ref-52754

---
An index is not a concordance, a list of all the words that appear in a document. A concordance lacks analysis and synthesis. It is simply a list of words. — location: [161](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=161) ^ref-7620

---
As creative, authored works, indexes are granted copyright registration. — location: [164](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=164) ^ref-17755

---
Often indexers are instructed to index every name in the text regardless of relevancy. We have all looked up entries in an index only to find nothing of value in the text at the point referenced. It is indeed the job of indexers to distinguish between substantive information and passing mention of a topic. If we do not make these distinctions, we waste the readers' time. — location: [200](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=200) ^ref-18920

---
Concepts in a book are not always stated verbatim. For example, in a book about raising dogs, several paragraphs may be devoted to various types of dog food. Never is the word nutrition mentioned; however, the concept nutrition should be in the index. The indexer reads between the lines, analyzes text, and identifies relevant concepts whether they are mentioned or not. — location: [202](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=202) ^ref-46006

---
An indexer shouldnot impose an external taxonomy that is not reflected in the document itself. If the author uses the term autos in the text, then the information about autos should be posted at autos, not at cars. — location: [206](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=206) ^ref-55807

---
Identifying related information and gathering it together in an appropriate place is one of the more difficult aspects of indexing. All too often inexperienced indexers focus on the minutiae of the text and neglect the big picture. — location: [214](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=214) ^ref-17651

---
The burden is on the indexer to anticipate the language of readers that may differ from that of the author, and to anticipate the expectations of different readers. — location: [233](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=233) ^ref-38493

---
However, the audiences for reference books can be quite different. We need to ask, Will the readers have specialized subject knowledge? How will they use the index? — location: [237](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=237) ^ref-24094

---
In a mass-market book that assumes little or no specialized knowledge the indexer must anticipate that some items may be looked up by readers in a variety of ways. — location: [242](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=242) ^ref-5670

---
The indexes for the printer manual and the home medical guide should address the needs of both types of index users. For users like Peter Perplexed, the index should be action-oriented. These index users should be able to locate terms like jammed paper and stopping bleeding in the indexes. — location: [258](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=258) ^ref-54674

---
The index must bring together references to similar concepts that are scattered in the text, or that are expressed in varying terminology. — location: [269](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=269) ^ref-35530

---
if there is a category of material that is not indexed, this should be stated in the introductory note. — location: [271](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=271) ^ref-47035

---
Headings should be as specific as the nature of the collection permits and the purposes of the users require. — location: [277](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=277) ^ref-37485

---
When citing an individual in the index, the indexer must cite the most complete name used in the text. — location: [355](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=355) ^ref-30785

---
A simple list of organization names, acronyms, and abbreviations can help the indexer maintain consistency in the index. — location: [362](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=362) ^ref-55485

---
Some geographic names pose the same problems as names of people and organizations. — location: [364](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=364) ^ref-27308

---
The general rule is not to index the footnote (or endnote) if it merely serves as a bibliographic reference. Footnotes are indexed when they add substantive information not otherwise included in the text. — location: [378](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=378) ^ref-8886

---
At the very least, an indexing contract should cover the following items:• the work to be indexed; expected length of the work• time schedule for delivery of final proofs to indexer and delivery of the index to the client• provisions regarding late delivery of material to the indexer; provisions regarding late delivery of the index to the author/publisher• provisions for additional indexing caused by pagination changes in the text• complete specifications regarding index format and submission format for the index• rate of pay for the index; the payment schedule• assignment of rights for the index — location: [493](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=493) ^ref-23226

---
The U.S. Copyright Act of 1976 (~)ioi) clearly states that a work is a work made for hire only "if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire" before works begins. — location: [499](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=499) ^ref-12663

---
When a book is printed, the pages are not printed one at a time. Instead, the printer uses large sheets of paper, often called press sheets. Such a sheet might be 49 inches by 37 inches, with 64 pages to a sheet, 32 pages on each side. A sheet of this sort will be cut and folded into groups of 16 pages. These groups are called signatures. When a book is laid out, the production editor will arrange the book so that it will come out in even signatures. A 32o-page book that is printed on a sheet that produces 32 pages on each side, 64 pages total, will require five 64-page press sheets for one copy of the book (320 pages divided by 64). If io,ooo copies of the book are printed, 50,000 press sheets will be required. — location: [617](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=617) ^ref-5425

The general sequence of events in the book production cycle is as follows:CopyeditingAuthor review of copyeditingCleanup copyeditingPage proof productionAuthor review of proofsRevised page proof productionProofreading/Indexing (one or the other may come first; both may go on simultaneously) — location: [634](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=634) ^ref-24978

---
An informal survey of production editors revealed that once copy for an index is received by a publisher, usually a week or less remains before the index must be delivered to the printer. There is no time for slipped schedules at this point. Missing a date with the printer can have dire consequences. — location: [647](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=647) ^ref-57549

---
There is often no cushion in the schedule by the time the indexer gets the pages. — location: [653](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=653) ^ref-49269

---
In well-written and well-edited books, the overall structure of the index emerges in tandem with the discussion in the text. — location: [662](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=662) ^ref-48376

---
a programmer's reference guide for a Java programming product will be much easier to index than Martin Heidegger's Being and Time. Reference books for programming languages are often highly structured documents that discuss discrete elements one at a time. Being and Time is also highly structured, but the discussion deals with complex conceptual issues that build upon one another. — location: [663](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=663) ^ref-49070

---
A two-week period to index a three-hundred-page book is not uncommon. A three-week schedule is considered generous. — location: [676](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=676) ^ref-23865

---
Many editors do not routinely provide front matter material for indexing. It is up to the indexer to inquire about the substance of the foreword, preface, or introduction and to ask for a table of contents even if the final version is not yet available. — location: [696](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=696) ^ref-15916

---
Whenever possible, the indexer should receive the glossary: it can be used as a quick reference during indexing and as a handy checklist during the editing of the index. — location: [708](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=708) ^ref-2790

---
appears in the glossary necessarily appears in the index, a great majority of glossary terms do. — location: [709](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=709) ^ref-58301

---
Although the content of appendixes may or may not be indexed, the presence of the material should be cited. — location: [710](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=710) ^ref-43553

---
In the above, the subheading "text of" clearly references the presence of the document in the appendix. — location: [713](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=713) ^ref-54887

---
It is important when deciding whether to index appendixes to distinguish between indexing the appendixes in detail or indexing them in a — location: [718](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=718) ^ref-22813

---
general manner, simply citing the presence of certain material. Given the cost and effort that goes into publishing a book, it is difficult to imagine material in appendixes being of such minor importance that their indexing is not required. The indexer's duty is to index the entire book. If adecision has been made to restrict the indexing, a statement to this effect should appear in an introductory note to the index. — location: [719](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=719) ^ref-28086

---
Relevant information in a book can be both explicit and implicit. Explicit information is that which is stated verbatim in the text. Simple examples of explicit information are the names of people or organizations discussed in the text. Implicit information is that which is implied but not stated word for word in the text. Quite often, general concepts are implicit information that must be identified by the indexer. — location: [727](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=727) ^ref-4288

---
The general rule regarding footnotes and endnotes is to index their contents only when they present material not found in the text. — location: [737](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=737) ^ref-46886

---
Scholarly books that contain notes often have a bibliography that lists all the references cited in the text. If a bibliography is not present, however, a strong argument can be made for the indexing of references in footnotes as this will be the only access to these references provided for readers. — location: [738](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=738) ^ref-62358

---
The effectiveness of any content analysis or indexing system is controlled by two main parameters, indexing exhaustivity and term specificity. — location: [763](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=763) ^ref-3367

---
The index in a highly specialized text that will be read by readers fluent in the technical language of the text will very likely be composed of a large percentage of specific and precise terms, whereas a book written for a larger group of readers some of whom are not specialists will have a greater mixture of broad and specific terms in the index. — location: [772](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=772) ^ref-20726

---
In the early portion of the indexing process, it is better to overindex than to underindex. Include every topic you think may be important. It is irritating to discover, midway through a book, detailed treatment of a topic that was discussed earlier but not indexed. Returning to the earlier chapters and searching for the initial discussion of the term can be quite tedious. It is much easier to codify or eliminate superfluous material than it is to locate information that was not indexed and later proves to be significant. — location: [777](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=777) ^ref-33011

---
Term selection is composed of two parts: identifying indexable topics and deciding how to present the topic in the index. — location: [781](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=781) ^ref-16646

---
Some indexers are not concerned with comprehensive term selection when marking pages. Instead they highlight particular types of terms that will be indexed. For example, if a book contains a great many personalnames, it may be helpful to use a highlighting pen to mark the names. — location: [829](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=829) ^ref-4867

---
Most publishers specialize in particular types of books. Their index style guides have emerged from years of experience with a particular type of book. At the very least, the style guide is an attempt to distill general indexing guidelines as they apply to a particular type of book. — location: [858](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=858) ^ref-58868

---
Many publishers know that not every book will fit into this general mold. So it is important to know that not every facet of a publisher's style guide is cast in stone. When there is good reason to change a specification, many editors will accommodate the indexer. But such changes should not be made lightly. The indexer will have to present a strong and persuasive argument regarding any changes to the house style. Unfortunately, the indexer will very likely be dealing with an editor who knows little about indexing and nothing about the raison d'etre of the house index style. — location: [860](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=860) ^ref-4425

---
The five basic elements of index style are presented below. Keep in mind that there are many other elements that are commonly dealt with in an indexing style guide.Alphabetizing of main entriesArrangement of subheadingsFormat of entriesFormat of reference locatorsFormat and placement of cross-references — location: [866](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=866) ^ref-55965

---
The nature of main heading terms also determines the nature of subheading terms. For example, a main heading that is very general may be followed by not only subheadings but also sub-subheadings. — location: [1024](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=1024) ^ref-38874

---
In a classified listing such as the one above, the subheadings can be located only if the reader first looks up vehicles. There is no direct access to automobiles, buses, or trucks. These subheadings are buried under the broad term vehicles. If readers do not understand the classification scheme, they will not be able to locate relevant information. — location: [1049](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=1049) ^ref-7578

---
Generally speaking, when index entries become extremely complex, going down to sub-subheading and sub-sub-subheading levels, it is a sign that the main heading lacks specificity. — location: [1052](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=1052) ^ref-1008

---
For a thorough and entertaining discussion of classification and classified headings, see G. Norman Knight's book Indexing, The Art of (1979, 96-Too). — location: [1053](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=1053) ^ref-17727

---
Again, we will assume that all the subheadings above also appear as main headings. These classified headings gather together related information for the readers. If these entries were eliminated, readers would have to read the entire book to find out which operating systems were discussed, or they would have to scan the entire index and locate the programs by name. — location: [1066](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=1066) ^ref-4940

---
Subtopic subheadings do not imply an organizational structure for the entire index. They do not prevent specific topics from having their own access points, nor require that they only be found in deep levels of classified arrays. Subtopic subheadings are simply one of several ways that subheadings can be related to the main heading. — location: [1073](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=1073) ^ref-46446

---
The thoughtful indexer will provide a balanced mixture of broad and narrow terms in the index. — location: [1077](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=1077) ^ref-64760

---
The purpose of subheadings is to filter information about a topic furtherso readers can perform a more refined search for information. — location: [1105](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=1105) ^ref-18528

---
Do Mi Stauber (2004, 149-158) identifies five types of subheadings: categorical subheadings, subtopic categorical subheadings, relational subheadings, descriptive-aspect subheadings, and feature subheadings. — location: [1112](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=1112) ^ref-38514

---
When the lack of a preposition creates an ambiguous subheading, the preposition should be included even if entries appear to be unparallel. In the example below, the subheadings clearly have two different meanings.managementby computersof computers — location: [1173](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=1173) ^ref-52801

---
The problem for the indexer is that Mary Smith is mentioned by name only in the note reference on page 387. If the only reference to Mary Smith is "Smith, Mary, 387n18," there is no convenient way for readers to locate the context where Mary Smith is actually discussed. — location: [1267](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=1267) ^ref-32167

---
To provide readers with the context of a referenced name that does not appear verbatim in the text, use a special locator format for the page number. — location: [1270](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=1270) ^ref-63893

---
When choosing a format for annotated reference locators, it is best to work with a sample entry that contains both annotated references and regular references. — location: [1275](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=1275) ^ref-40552

---
The problems that arise with reference locators that include table numbers or note numbers may become apparent when sample entries are formatted for review. For example,Gordon setters, 23, 55nn 23, 27, 135Gordon setters, 23, 55(nn 23, 27), 135Gordon setters, 23, 55n23, n27, 135Gordon setters, 23, 55nn23, 27, 135gross national product, 35, 56(t12), 121gross national product, 35, 56t.12, 121gross national product, 35, 56t12, 121gross national product, 35, 56T12, 121 — location: [1277](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=1277) ^ref-36671

---
Frequently, the indexer will not know the complete form of an entry until the entire text has been indexed. To maintain term consistency, the indexer may decide initially to use a See reference. Later, during the editing phase of the index, the indexer can make a final determination on the benefit to the readers of double-posting the terms instead. — location: [1353](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=1353) ^ref-53841

In order to access specific information, readers must possess a good amount of knowledge about when the information might have appeared within the particular time spectrum for the book. — location: [1540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=1540) ^ref-52568

---
When subheadings are sorted in page number order, the demand for clear and structured term selection disappears. Since the entries will not be sorted alphabetically, the wording of the entries is less important. — location: [1542](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=1542) ^ref-46710

The practice of editing only the generated index is quite common. Many technical writers tell me that one of the first things they do when they revise a manual written by another writer is to generate an index from the files. Frequently, the index generated from the embedded entries turns out to be quite different from the index printed in the manual. Apparently, the original writer made changes in the generated index without returning to the document files to correct the embedded entries. Just as writers can fine-tune documents in their final, formatted state, so, too, indexers should be able to work with a formatted index and have the embedded entries automatically updated. — location: [3133](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0030BF1MI&location=3133) ^ref-47504
