## Highlights
many of us who are intuitive have developed a critical voice inside to protect us from the embarrassment of having to explain our intuition to people who are not intuitive. — location: [289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=289) ^ref-10549

---
anyone who doesn’t know the feeling of intuition prodding at you is a potential candidate for making you feel you need to question intuition.) — location: [291](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=291) ^ref-4992

---
Not all internal voices are intuition. Some of them are learned coping mechanisms, designed to protect us or to help us or to promote success. We can’t just exile those parts (they’re still part of us), but we need to helpfully integrate them, and that can take long months or years of work. But it’s work that’s worth doing. — location: [297](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=297) ^ref-61703

---
Here’s what can happen if we need to differentiate between internal voices and don’t do the work: We might decide to start writing intuitively and then hit a stress spot and not be able to publish the book because the critical inner voice gets loud. We might get into the middle of an intuitive decision we’re trusting and find the internal pushback causes us to disconnect and lean heavily on coping mechanisms that push us farther from our creativity. We might still live with those critical voices on the outside, and not have the skills or the capacity to fight them off, no matter how brilliant our intuition might be. — location: [307](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=307) ^ref-23577

---
What I don’t want us to do is create internal instability by trying to follow intuition that will lead to more frozenness or more flight mechanisms. — location: [312](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=312) ^ref-5873

---
We are still allowed to Question the Premise (QTP) of others’ assertions. Because, of course, we all know those stubbornly ignorant people who yell, “I just know” — location: [326](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=326) ^ref-44444

---
The goal is to learn to trust our own intuition. Not to worry about anyone else’s. — location: [328](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=328) ^ref-1013

---
we hear how certain they are in those assertions, so we hold back on our own internal trust when we should just ignore them—when we should instead hone our trust of our intuition. — location: [331](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=331) ^ref-50689

---
Intellectual intuition is the ability to see patterns in thoughts (sometimes theirs, sometimes others’) and make meaning out of them without needing every specific part of the pattern laid out. This might mean an ability to see the pattern in someone’s thinking that would indicate a particular type of function or dysfunction. It might mean an ability to extrapolate thought patterns to solve philosophical conundrums. But it might also allow a person to see the thinking behind emotions. — location: [452](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=452) ^ref-53497

---
It’s not about feeling emotions. It’s about understanding thought patterns that drive behavior. — location: [459](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=459) ^ref-20077

---
When you can see a set of numbers and have an intuition about how to move them around or how to increase one part to make the whole better, or when you can see the natural relationships and patterns between the numbers, you have systemic intuition. You’re looking at a bounded set of data and connecting whatever missing pieces might be there, and then intuiting what needs to change. — location: [488](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=488) ^ref-3726

---
Her intellectual intuition allows her to seek out motivations and read behavior and tailor the story to the people as she discovers them. One of the very first things she said to me when we started coaching was, “I don’t know how I write each book.” (And she’s finished dozens of novels at this point.) Part of her journey as a professional writer has been to trust the intellectual intuition (the way she can read behavior and understand motivations), even when there’s a part of her intellectual brain that really wants to know the story ahead of time. — location: [521](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=521) ^ref-48196

---
When I am intuitive, and I can’t objectively prove my correctness to someone else with certainty (X on the graph), I mistrust my gut responses. I’m also more likely to believe someone else’s certainty, whether or not they are correct, when I have an internal lack of certainty. — location: [662](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=662) ^ref-55911

---
You don’t have to explain your intuition to anyone. You don’t have to justify its existence. If there are people in your life who don’t understand the way you make decisions, they shouldn’t be controlling your decision-making with their lack of understanding. — location: [691](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=691) ^ref-7456

---
your intuition might be wrong at times, but it won’t get more capable if you don’t exercise it. It won’t become smarter if you don’t trust it. If the fear of being wrong or the fear of failure is keeping you from trusting intuition, then I highly recommend working on that as your development project following reading this book. Increasing your ability to be wrong, or your ability to see failure as the path to success will pay off exponentially. This might be the most important skill an intuitive can possess. — location: [693](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=693) ^ref-28355

---
you will not become a better intuitive writer by outlining if you are a discovery writer. — location: [759](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=759) ^ref-53331

What is the key to having a plot in your book? Causality. All the plotting books agree, the key to a plot is cause-and-effect of some kind. The most common example that gets tossed around in plotting classes and books, about the difference between story and plot, is about the king and the queen. You’ve likely all heard it. “‘The king died, and the queen died’ is a story; ‘The king died, and the queen died of grief’ is a plot.” The “of grief” implies that the king’s death caused the queen’s death, and then there’s the implication that the queen’s death will cause something else to happen. — location: [781](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=781) ^ref-48889

---
no one is teaching intuitives how to be better intuitive writers. Everyone is teaching us how to plot, though. — location: [811](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=811) ^ref-35556

---
There is no such thing as plotting vs. pants-ing. There is only explicit plotting and intuitive plotting. Objective plotting and subjective plotting. One is outside the snow globe, one is inside. When you write, as an intuitive, you plot subconsciously (sometimes even semi-consciously), but you are still plotting. — location: [813](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=813) ^ref-44305

---
I see people who have an extremely high degree of unconscious competence, where they couldn’t teach you the skill they’re using, and where they cycle from Step Two (that unconscious competence) into Step Three (where they think they don’t know what they’re doing), and then try to learn how to do their process differently. — location: [869](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=869) ^ref-64913

---
When you have an intuitive brain, you have an autopilot computer. You put the data in, and the computer shows you the story. The computer gets honed over the years by consuming great stories and becoming aware of what you love about storytelling. It gets honed by getting feedback about what you’ve done that worked, and finding out what data you’re missing. It gets honed by iterating the process of writing and trying to get better at the individual skills where I can progress through the pyramid. Of course, the problem is, there is no manual for this computer. — location: [881](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=881) ^ref-16711

In Big Magic, author Elizabeth Gilbert lays out some beautiful theories about the creative process. One is the notion that an idea can be an entity unto itself, something that finds you and wants to work with you in order to take form in our world. Another notion is that genius isn’t something a person is, but a relationship one has with something outside themselves. — location: [919](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=919) ^ref-21688

---
seeing the creative process as a collaboration in that way can ease some pressure. If we feel allowed to wait for our Muse or helpful genius, we might feel freer to give ourselves the time we need to let our unconscious processes do their thing. — location: [925](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=925) ^ref-30455

---
I consider myself an immersive writer. That’s what I call writers who write not only from inside the snow globe, but from “inside the character suit.” They are feeling their way around their fictional world, while also experiencing that world as the character in a way similar to what’s described as “method acting.” — location: [931](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=931) ^ref-29532

---
Often, when we’re trying to find that middle ground between following who we are as sensitive intuitives, how our brains want to function in our creativity, and trying to find an audience and make a living, we’re directed right back to The Right Way to think, which is not our way. And when we try to follow the instructions and advice of our more concrete-thinking peers, often delivered with the best of intentions, we find ourselves stuck, blocked, and burned out. — location: [967](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=967) ^ref-13149

---
We find writers who have internalized messages about writing outlines and following a plan, who aren’t able to see when that plan is failing them. — location: [983](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=983) ^ref-30620

---
The original concept, idea, or even outline, which once gave them clarity simply needs to be re-jiggered, based on what they’ve learned about the characters and the world through living in it for a bit. — location: [985](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=985) ^ref-34785

---
What if the special kind of creativity employed by some intuitive people requires belief? In a similar way, possibly, to how positive attitude affects some medical outcomes? What if your belief in that magic, your faith and trust in your creative ability, is your tether to your Deep Well, that part of your consciousness where the truly special waits to be released? — location: [1000](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1000) ^ref-17143

---
If you think back to who you were as a writer, before you decided to “become a writer” and learn how it’s done, what was different? What was easier? What was better? — location: [1004](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1004) ^ref-60469

---
What if I can’t do it again? What if it won’t work this time? What if all those other books were flukes? If you knew how many writers feel this exact fear… and most of us can never admit this to anyone (except maybe a coach or our night stand). Even if it’s not quite this level of terror. Even if it’s that momentary, what if I can’t do this again? That’s still fear. When you’re good at something, but you don’t know how you’re good at it, the feeling disorients. — location: [1019](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1019) ^ref-49748

---
The autopilot does exist. It may need some honing, or some training. It may need some conscious structure (for some of us). But often, what it really needs is better input and more practice. Autopilot works through data collection. There are sensors on all parts of the plane that feed data into the computer the whole flight long. So if the plane veers off course, the autopilot knows and can correct to stay on course. So that’s one part. Sensors. The coordinates (where we’re leaving from, and where we’re flying to) are another part. The computer sets a flight path that the sensors use to keep the plane on course. That’s the second part. Coordinates. And finally, there’s the pilot. Pilots have full control over the system if they want it. They can intentionally shut down autopilot and take control of the aircraft if they need to.1 That’s the third part. Vigilance. — location: [1030](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1030) ^ref-3437

---
Sensors First, if you’re intuitive, you are constantly taking in data. You gather information and your subconscious brain makes connections between that information. — location: [1041](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1041) ^ref-49980

---
we are all taking in stories to build our internal story sensor. (This is one of the reasons we encourage you to read the best books you can, or watch the best movies you can. Not “best” like the critics say they’re the best, but the “best” for your audience. The thing your audience wants to read.) — location: [1070](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1070) ^ref-3896

---
Most intuitive writers can give you a list of things they learned not to do, when they were first writing. (Don’t start with backstory. Don’t write long paragraphs. Those were my first two.) That’s one type of sensor, too. Feedback from others. Most — location: [1076](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1076) ^ref-16420

---
It’s possible to be a good (or great) writer with only your own internal story sensors as your guide. Or to employ some vigilance over what you do and don’t pay attention to. (Like selecting which of your editor’s developmental feedback to listen to.) So I don’t want to insist that you have to intentionally use all these data sets to hone your intuition. — location: [1086](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1086) ^ref-48248

---
Do you need to be aware of the sensors? No. Do you need to be conscious of the data? No. You just need to be aware that the sensors are there, picking up the data about whether or not the scene / story / premise / character is compelling. — location: [1090](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1090) ^ref-605

---
Whenever I talk to intuitive writers about autopilot, someone inevitably says, “wow, I wish I could just know exactly where I’m going.” What they mean is, “I wish I could get a list of directions for where to drive on the map.” I would say, your autopilot does actually know where it’s going. It just doesn’t always tell you. — location: [1101](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1101) ^ref-33876

---
There’s something about knowing the nuances of the character that will provide the “lock-in” for these writers. Typically, as they’re writing, they have to keep referring to the characters and who they are in order to solve plot problems. In fact, more often than not, any stuckness in a book can be solved by returning to the coordinates. Character coordinates might look like: Emotions in the scene Emotional arc throughout the book Conflicting motivations Character backstory Trajectory of character development What a character needs to learn Every character-driven writer connects with a slightly different manifestation of character coordinates. — location: [1115](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1115) ^ref-30925

---
If you happen to use character coordinates to steer your autopilot, and you also outline, you need to give yourself permission to change the outline to suit who the characters become as you write the draft. — location: [1126](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1126) ^ref-8586

---
Those of you who are stakes-first writers need to know what matters to a person before you can write them. What do they have to lose? What is on the line? — location: [1154](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1154) ^ref-8167

---
When you need to know the stakes before you can write, you are often looking for the central conflict or the central dilemma that the story revolves around. Once you know the stakes (what’s at stake for each character), the conflict builds itself. One wins for awhile, the other wins for awhile, and then there’s a big showdown. — location: [1160](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1160) ^ref-62659

---
We can’t turn off our autopilot intuition completely, but we can “switch to manual” for a length of time. Often, this happens unintentionally. — location: [1203](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1203) ^ref-39341

---
When this type of don’t-know-what’s-wrong intuition happens, there will always be a fix that presents itself once you start digging in. It will often be a painful process — location: [1216](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1216) ^ref-15415

---
Almost always, I need to dig deep into what I’ve just written, have someone throw ideas at me for how to fix it, and shoot most of them down. — location: [1218](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1218) ^ref-11830

---
What I’ve found to be true for almost all writers who get to this place is that there’s a particular type of intuition coordinate (character, ending, turning point, stakes, etc.) that’s causing the glitch. Typically, knowing which one drives your orientation will help. The real key for this type: It’s okay not to know. — location: [1222](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1222) ^ref-55716

---
Questions to ask: “Has ‘just writing through it’ worked for me in the past?” and “What’s my first instinct?” — location: [1259](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1259) ^ref-8015

---
I Need to Know What Happened This is an offshoot of something-is-wrong-but-I-don’t-know-where vigilance. Typically, when you feel the “something’s wrong” feeling, your immediate response will be to look all the way forward or all the way backward. (What happened to them before the book started, or how is this going to end?) — location: [1261](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1261) ^ref-37398

---
Knowing motivation from the start won’t stop this from happening, because the motivation you think they have and the motivation they show you will often be different.1 — location: [1266](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1266) ^ref-60744

Questions to ask: “Have I gone back and read a couple of chapters?” and “Do I need to go back to the beginning of the book?” — location: [1290](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1290) ^ref-54058

You might need to read a book (research or another fiction book). Maybe watch a documentary. Or open the (gasp!) internet to research. — location: [1297](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1297) ^ref-13784

---
Questions to ask: “Is there something I need to research?” and “Is there a nagging question I need to answer about the character?” — location: [1305](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1305) ^ref-34056

---
some writers will switch back and forth between different types of vigilance even within the same book. The key isn’t that you have to be one type. They key is diagnosing what’s going on so you can get through the stoppage quicker. — location: [1308](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1308) ^ref-44585

---
The other 5/8 of writers bounce back and forth between needing to know something and needing to know nothing. This segment is the hardest place to be when you’re first starting off because you’re never sure just how much to plot and how much not to. Often, those of us in the “middle” of the extremes have to do a lot of experimentation about how much information we need and don’t need. Therefore, our process can change almost from book to book while we discover how much we need to know. — location: [1325](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1325) ^ref-2928

---
Some may actually loathe the idea of going back and editing. Typically, we see a few major reasons why that loathing happens. You’re not in the stream anymore, so the immersion in the story isn’t the same the second time through. You’re afraid you’ve made major mistakes that will require major rewrites. You’re afraid you didn’t follow the rules and you don’t want to face the extreme process of forcing your book to follow the rules. When the dislike of editing comes from a place of fear-of-mistakes, we try to coach a growth mindset. — location: [1363](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1363) ^ref-12310

---
This is where we need to differentiate between intuition and skill. — location: [1370](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1370) ^ref-33034

---
When it’s intuition, it will be backed up by personality alignment. It will be backed up by a desire to find more certainty about what happens next. It will be supported by a desire to make sure you do justice to the story or the characters. We’ll see a need to process more deeply or to think over something. Intuition is always backed up by something you don’t know. — location: [1386](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1386) ^ref-29759

---
Not wanting to edit is often an intuitive goal misalignment with the goals of editing. When it’s intuition, it will be backed up by not caring how someone else thinks the books hit. It will be supported by a lack of desire to do it ‘right” according to an external standard or by a knowledge that I’ve done what needs to be done in the story and it doesn’t need to be changed. We’ll see a comfort with the books selling however they’re going to sell. “I’ve done it the way I want to do it.” That’s what it sounds like when intuition is at play. — location: [1390](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1390) ^ref-18310

---
Some intuitive writers genuinely can’t get back into the stream of the book once they’ve told the story the first time. They’re not interested in thinking about whether or not they made the right choices, and they can’t get re-immersed in the story in the same way. They’re also generally okay with however the books do without major edits. (This isn’t to say they don’t proofread or maybe even do line edits, but they’re not interested in revisions, major edits, or outside opinions about whether or not their stories are correct.) — location: [1404](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1404) ^ref-62002

---
But more often, the last two reasons (afraid of major mistakes, or a dislike of doing major revision work) are the more common reasons we see intuitive writers not liking editing. — location: [1410](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1410) ^ref-951

---
If we assume that intuition is “just knowing” without knowing how you know, then the immersive writing process plays into that strength of intuition. When I try to force myself into awareness about “why” I made a decision, that’s the opposite of letting the autopilot run. Suddenly, I’m in unfamiliar territory. If I can’t know why I made a choice, how can I unmake it? How will I know what to do? — location: [1412](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1412) ^ref-8979

Their intuition knows what needs to change, but that resistance is there because rhetorical questions cause thought spirals and then we decide there’s a lion at the mouth of the — location: [1422](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1422) ^ref-29821

---
editing is one of the best ways to hone your intuition. When we talk more at the end of the book about strategies to hone intuition, one of the first ones we discuss is editing. — location: [1426](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1426) ^ref-25185

---
When you can see where your intuition was leading you in one direction, you can start to help your autopilot ask better questions on the way through the draft the first time. — location: [1427](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1427) ^ref-45982

---
Trying to force intuition into a rule box is not teaching intuition how to be more intuitive. — location: [1438](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1438) ^ref-61373

---
There are still guiding principles to how your intuition can create story, but it won’t look like, “at 25%, you’d better have this and at 50%, you’d better have this.” It will look like, “is something compelling happening here?” Or, “Is this scene moving the story forward?” Or, “Is there still tension here?” Or, “Do I still want to keep reading? If not, why not?” Understanding the answers to the big-picture questions is more likely to help you hone your intuition than learning how to apply rules backwards to an intuitively written story. — location: [1439](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1439) ^ref-18738

---
Following rules can trip up intuition. Following coordinates (I should have stakes shifting… how long has it been since the stakes shifted?) is intuition. — location: [1454](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1454) ^ref-4327

---
If we’re intuitive, or if we’re abstract, or if we’re big-picture, we want to edit for intuitive concepts, abstract concepts, or big-picture concepts. We want to edit for coordinates. Are my characters making compelling choices that create conflict (internal or external)? Are the stakes high enough? Do they have enough to lose (internally or externally—not all stories are the same balance of those two)? Are my threads getting tied up and opened? Are there open threads somewhere that I could be touching? Am I pushing the action forward? Am I complicating things or raising stakes or changing trajectory? — location: [1461](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1461) ^ref-17021

---
Every type of intuition coordinate has a different set of questions they’ll want to ask of themselves. Each of those examples of questions are things I will routinely pull out to ask writers if they’re headed back into revisions. Rather than focusing on rules or structure, I try to focus with intuitive writers on the coordinates that guide them through the story. If they are character driven, we focus on characters and their feelings and motivations. If they are plot driven, we focus on turning points and raising stakes. If they are sense-of-place writers, we focus on the environment and the events. — location: [1468](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1468) ^ref-31685

if editing causes fear because you’re afraid you don’t follow the rules, stop using that editing process. Find your coordinates instead, and find your vigilance areas, and work to your own set of rules. Not an arbitrary set of rules. — location: [1477](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1477) ^ref-53485

becoming better at intuition is about building the three parts of your autopilot. Continuing to push good data at your sensors. Honing how you feed your coordinates. Strategically engaging your vigilance. — location: [1490](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1490) ^ref-51149

How To Develop Your Sensors This is the place where we generally want the least amount of awareness of data. Most of the time, pressing too hard on “what data am I taking in” will overwhelm. The more intuitive we are, our best sensor-interpretation ability is subconscious. Not conscious. — location: [1496](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1496) ^ref-10664

---
Keep watching movies or shows. Keep reading good books. Keep consuming story. Keep looking at your own story. Keep researching. Keep thinking about your characters or discovering more about them. Keep feeding yourself the data or processing the data how you normally process it. Even. If. You. Also. Enjoy. These. Activities. They. Are. Still. Work. — location: [1500](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1500) ^ref-58804

we can also start reminding our wise self that we do need to feed our sensors. That means consuming good story. In any medium that works for you. Build the sensors. — location: [1516](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1516) ^ref-20468

How To Develop Your Coordinates — location: [1518](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1518) ^ref-50198

---
pick out all the types of coordinates you’ve used in the past. Copy those descriptions or the questions onto a piece of paper (or use the Stuck List workbook we discussed earlier2). Keep that accessible as you write and plan. Coordinates are the place in your autopilot where you can have a bit more awareness, because they’re often the reason you get stuck. Knowing what questions to ask when you’re stuck is the big key to developing your intuition. — location: [1519](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1519) ^ref-29965

---
Becoming better at honing your coordinates might mean: Phoning a friend more quickly. Walking away from the computer faster. Writing about writing without the “I give up” moment. Going to research the thing I keep trying to avoid researching. Leaving the house faster. Tracking back to read what you’ve already written without it being the last resort. — location: [1528](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1528) ^ref-1408

not everyone can write to market, period. Some of us have internal sensors that are not related to any reader feedback or editorial feedback. We’re just writing to please ourselves. So when our interest or what we believe is a compelling story overlaps with what the market wants to read, we sell. And when those interests don’t overlap, we don’t sell as well — location: [1594](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1594) ^ref-48610

---
When you’re primarily interested in what makes you happy, it’s not worth trying to turn that off so you can write to market. It’s a much better alignment to find the market where the books you like are selling. Not everyone will want to (or do well when they) write to market. — location: [1614](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1614) ^ref-21478

watch your intake. If you’re searching out information all the time about how you are wrong in what you’re doing, you’re going to find it. I guarantee. Sometimes, it’s more important to shut down intake for your sanity than it is for you to find what might or might not be wrong right now. The third thing I’d suggest is: try just trusting. — location: [1683](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1683) ^ref-42428

Experiment with your intuition and see what produces the best results. It’s genuinely difficult to build trust in intuition if you’re not willing to let it be right and be wrong. — location: [1687](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1687) ^ref-9652

When your vigilance is unstudied (you don’t know the places to pull back and the places not to), you’re almost always early in your career. Typically, the people in the previous subheading (your vigilance is confused) are farther into their career.

Yes, learning can be helpful. But if you’re intuitive, nothing will be as helpful as iteration. — location: [1698](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1698) ^ref-46921

---
Having a platform as an intuitive can be overwhelming because everyone is telling us what we should do and where we should be and even when it conflicts with our intuition about what we want and don’t want, we might follow the advice because we can’t be certain they’re not correct. — location: [1746](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1746) ^ref-57465

---
Running a platform as an intuitive author has to take two things into account: 1) the potential for diminishing returns 2) the internal hesitation or catalyzing — location: [1751](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1751) ^ref-40549

If you would identify has an HSP, limiting your access to social media becomes even more important (and email, potentially), because the more people’s emotions you’re exposed to, the less in control of your own thought trains you are. — location: [1771](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1771) ^ref-1666

When intuitive people talk about getting a gut feeling they shouldn’t do something, that hesitation is always worth exploring. I — location: [1775](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1775) ^ref-32217

---
Because this internal limiter (the hesitation) can often have buried reasons like that, it can be difficult to trust them. But there’s always a reason. (Not everyone needs to know the reason, of course, but when you’re questioning the premise, you really do need to know the reason. Because if that had really been true, if they really hadn’t liked going to new places, then that trip would have been a bad idea. Plus, sometimes the internal limiter is putting together other pieces of data, thinks it’s not conscious of, and it really can’t tell the reason. — location: [1794](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1794) ^ref-3569

So this part (when to take the wheel, and when not to follow a system) becomes the most complicated question of all to answer. When am I failing because I haven’t learned enough yet? When am I failing because something needs to change? When am I failing because I need to not advertise these books? — location: [1908](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1908) ^ref-63315

---
Make sure the person is a patient-with-questions person. You absolutely need to be able to ask questions of an expert when you’re an intuitive. You’ll catch some things very quickly, and some things not as quickly. Patience is key and willingness to answer questions. — location: [1929](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1929) ^ref-35203

To Fulfill a Childhood Dream So many of us were readers as children and decided we wanted to be writers because of the stories we consumed. — location: [1990](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1990) ^ref-36530

Alignment with this dream often looks like stubbornness or resilience. The “but I’ve always known I would do this” feeling that makes you continue to learn or experiment or publish, even when the results aren’t showing what would fulfill the dream. — location: [1996](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1996) ^ref-52492

To Tell The Stories So many authors know what it’s like to have characters in our heads, talking to us. Either we’re telling their stories compulsively, because we can’t not, or we want to tell the stories intentionally, because the process of telling stories is so much fun. — location: [1998](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=1998) ^ref-7759

To Write Great Books — location: [2042](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=2042) ^ref-41382

---
we’d discussed how important it was that the books were as good as they could be. Not just good enough, but as good as they could be. That’s a very different standard from minimum viable product (and minimum viable product works very well for a lot of people… just not for everyone). For some writers, writing great books requires a whole different type of alignment, business-wise, from other purposes. It might require more time or more edit rounds. It might require more thought or more ideas. (And yes, it’s possible to write great books without them taking forever… this is not quality over quantity. It’s about alignment. — location: [2048](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=2048) ^ref-31658

---
Given the goal of “great books,” they were as productive as they could possibly be. It wasn’t a waste of time to focus on quality, for them, because that was the promise they made to their readers. — location: [2055](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=2055) ^ref-38985

Generally speaking, when you’ve learned a system and it isn’t working, it’s the wrong system for you. You’re not doing it wrong. (I mean, in theory, you might be failing to execute parts of the plan, but it’s not likely that more work will help execute better.) When your intuition is screaming at you that it’s the wrong fit, scream back at the part that says, “but we have to do it this way.” — location: [2075](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=2075) ^ref-59526

If a person isn’t willing to step inside the snow globe with you and believe you are right about what you see, they are not worth listening to. For intuitives, or really, for anyone. But especially for intuitives. — location: [2235](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=2235) ^ref-51953

---
bringing someone inside your snow globe is the best way to listen to business advice. Having someone you trust (whoever that person is) to help you interpret the data coming at you will be one of the most important investments of your time you can make. It’s also why we encourage people to seek out author friends who are similar to you and who have similar goals and who you click with. Having people to help you understand what’s going on inside your mind and inside your slow globe is priceless. Find your village. — location: [2335](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=2335) ^ref-62784

---
In order to truly move past the situation, we have to accept the fact that we didn’t know something, or that our intuition missed something. We do want to be curious about how the “missing it” happened. Typically, when we work through this in coaching, we’re looking for the data that our sensors were picking up. What was making me believe this was a good idea? Was I not casting a wide enough research net? Was I afraid of failure? Was I listening to a particular person who doesn’t have my best interests at heart? Was I trusting certainty = correct? What was the cause of the intuitive failure? The more compassion I can have for my past selves and how they handled things at their best, the more quickly I can move past the failure and into the learning curve. — location: [2423](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=2423) ^ref-24030

Here’s what acceptance looks like. Let’s use the example of I should have released better. Okay, what factors contributed to the release? Other than, of course, everyone else’s releases, world politics and economics, complex algorithms, reader preferences/moods, and all the other factors out of your control?1 And then, what was in my control? Which factors of those are in my control? Realistically. Which factors of those are realistic to expect? (If — location: [2431](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=2431) ^ref-64756

It may seem strange to think that there’s a part of you that needs forgiveness from another part of you, but that’s exactly what has to happen when intuition is wrong. We have to see that little part of ourselves that was doing its best and bring it back into the fold. Keeping it outside in the rain isn’t going to do anything. It needs to be forgiven and integrated. Moving forward, the intuition has to feel like you trust it again. As a collective, you need to know which data to trust and which data to seek out, yes. You do want to learn from the experience. But, absolutely, re-integrate the intuition after the acceptance, so you can move forward with intuition on your team again. — location: [2460](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=2460) ^ref-12954

---
Strategize Now that you’re all on the same team again, it’s important to strategize about how not to end up in that place again. If there are groups or people you need to stop listening to, make that happen. If there are markers to be on the lookout for, keep vigilant. But most of the time, what happened in the past won’t replicate itself, so the biggest strategy we can implement is moving forward with trust in the intuition. No more punishing. No more past-excavating. Forgiveness, and forward motion. — location: [2465](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=2465) ^ref-62692

Find Intuitive-Friendly Environments A huge part of teaching your intuition how to be smarter is about who you surround yourself with (because your sensors are always taking in the data of the people around you). When people understand intuition and are supportive of it, you’re in an intuitive-friendly environment. — location: [2474](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=2474) ^ref-63058

She said, “You need to find someone who knows you really well, and who tends to give you advice based on what they know about you, and will ask questions where they don’t know.” This is the intuitive-friendly environment.

People who will step inside your snow globe and listen to what you have to say and believe your intuition. — location: [2481](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=2481) ^ref-3122

The intuitive-friendly response is not, “But you don’t have experience.” It is not, “But you don’t know that for sure.” It is not, “But it goes against every best practice we know.” It is not, “show your work,” in that power-over, condescending voice. It sounds more like, “I wonder why your intuition went there,” in a curious, friendly, let-the-deer-come-to-you voice. — location: [2490](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=2490) ^ref-34817

Sometimes, you need baby steps, and sometimes, you need leaps. And sometimes, you just need to survive and get through. In order to hone your intuition, you need to become more aware of what you need in order to be at your best. When you are in a time of life that is exceptionally difficult, and your body and mind lock up if you don’t feel safe, then you need safety. When you are in a learning curve, you might need baby steps, or a step backward. And when you need challenges, you need challenges. — location: [2525](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=2525) ^ref-11190

with writers, I see two very opposite extremes in this part of intuition honing. 1) Blaming others when it’s my fault. 2) Blaming myself when it was out of my control. Very rarely do I see these two together. Most of us trend heavily toward one or the other. — location: [2540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=2540) ^ref-59688

Living the intuitive life, from here on out, is all about living as though your intuition is your superpower. It means creating environments that are intuition-friendly. It means making space for intuition to happen unhindered. It means shutting down sources of input that are damaging your intuitive ability to function. It means nurturing your ability. It means taking action when you feel an intuitive push. For some of us, that will mean making space for more silence. For others, it will mean making space for more action. — location: [2635](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=2635) ^ref-3122

So, so, so many of us who are intuitive need more space, as a general rule. Either we need more time to think or process, or we need more space from people whose emotions are big, or we need more freedom to go deeper into the story, or we need to stop getting all the voices confusing our intuition. If this is you, please make the space. Shut down the inputs. Get out of the environments. — location: [2659](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09WJ9V3JQ&location=2659) ^ref-65508
