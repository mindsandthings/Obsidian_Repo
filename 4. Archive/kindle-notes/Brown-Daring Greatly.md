## Highlights
Wholehearted living is about engaging in our lives from a place of worthiness. It means cultivating the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think, No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough. It’s going to bed at night thinking, Yes, I am imperfect and vulnerable and sometimes afraid, but that doesn’t change the truth that I am also brave and worthy of love and belonging. — location: [195](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=195) ^ref-36064

vulnerability hangovers of my life. You know that feeling when you wake up and everything feels fine until the memory of laying yourself open washes over you and you want to hide under the covers? — location: [236](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=236) ^ref-46585

everyone from C-level executives to the frontline folks talk to me about stem from disengagement, the lack of feedback, the fear of staying relevant amid rapid change, and the need for clarity of purpose. — location: [255](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=255) ^ref-47535

Lynne Twist. In her book The Soul of Money, she refers to scarcity as “the great lie.” She writes: For me, and for many of us, our first waking thought of the day is “I didn’t get enough sleep.” The next one is “I don’t have enough time.” Whether true or not, that thought of not enough occurs to us automatically before we even think to question or examine it. We spend most of the hours and the days of our lives hearing, explaining, complaining, or worrying about what we don’t have enough of.…Before we even sit up in bed, before our feet touch the floor, we’re already inadequate, already behind, already losing, already lacking something. And by the time we go to bed at night, our minds are racing with a litany of what we didn’t get, or didn’t get done, that day. — location: [361](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=361) ^ref-865

---
Worrying about scarcity is our culture’s version of post-traumatic stress. It happens when we’ve been through too much, and rather than coming together to heal (which requires vulnerability), we’re angry and scared and at each other’s throats. — location: [385](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=385) ^ref-8444

Vulnerability isn’t good or bad: It’s not what we call a dark emotion, nor is it always a light, positive experience. Vulnerability is the core of all emotions and feelings. To feel is to be vulnerable. — location: [429](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=429) ^ref-6064

We love seeing raw truth and openness in other people, but we’re afraid to let them see it in us. We’re afraid that our truth isn’t enough—that what we have to offer isn’t enough without the bells and whistles, without editing, and impressing. — location: [514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=514) ^ref-15188

Vulnerability is based on mutuality and requires boundaries and trust. It’s not oversharing, it’s not purging, it’s not indiscriminate disclosure, — location: [566](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=566) ^ref-15178

When we think about betrayal in terms of the marble jar metaphor, most of us think of someone we trust doing something so terrible that it forces us to grab the jar and dump out every single marble. — location: [635](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=635) ^ref-36988

Ah! But the idea that that is an appropriate and proportionate reaction means that being betrayed is no longer catastrophic. It is within the system

---
When the people we love or with whom we have a deep connection stop caring, stop paying attention, stop investing, and stop fighting for the relationship, trust begins to slip away and hurt starts seeping in. Disengagement triggers shame and our greatest fears—the fears of being abandoned, unworthy, and unlovable. What can make this covert betrayal so much more dangerous than something like a lie or an affair is that we can’t point to the source of our pain—there’s no event, — location: [645](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=645) ^ref-16605

Having spent so long trying to describe and define unnamed emotions and experiences, I find that Harry Potter has given me a treasure trove of characters, monsters, and images to use in my teaching.

“Yes, shame is tough to talk about. But the conversation isn’t nearly as dangerous as what we’re creating with our silence! We all experience shame. We’re all afraid to talk about it.

If you’re wondering what happens if you attach your self-worth to your art or your product and people love it, let me answer that from personal and professional experience. You’re in even deeper trouble. Everything shame needs to hijack and control your life is in place. You’ve handed over your self-worth to what people think. It’s panned out a couple of times, but now it feels a lot like Hotel California: You can check in, but you can never leave. You’re officially a prisoner of “pleasing, performing, and perfecting.” With an awareness — location: [777](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=777) ^ref-59737

Shame is the fear of disconnection—it’s the fear that something we’ve done or failed to do, an ideal that we’ve not lived up to, or a goal that we’ve not accomplished makes us unworthy of connection. — location: [838](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=838) ^ref-57768

I mean the ability to practice authenticity when we experience shame, to move through the experience without sacrificing our values, and to come out on the other side of the shame experience with more courage, compassion, and connection than we had going into it. — location: [906](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=906) ^ref-59292

If we can share our story with someone who responds with empathy and understanding, shame can’t survive. Self-compassion is also critically important, but because shame is a social concept—it happens between people—it also heals best between people. — location: [909](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=909) ^ref-50441

Recognizing Shame and Understanding Its Triggers. Shame is biology and biography. Can you physically recognize when you’re in the grips of shame, feel your way through it, and figure out what messages and expectations triggered it? Practicing Critical Awareness. Can you reality-check the messages and expectations that are driving your shame? Are they realistic? Attainable? Are they what you want to be or what you think others need/want from you? Reaching Out. Are you owning and sharing your story? We can’t experience empathy if we’re not connecting. Speaking Shame. Are you talking about how you feel and asking for what you need when you feel shame? — location: [914](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=914) ^ref-54368

I was not prepared to hear over and over from men how the women—the mothers, sisters, girlfriends, wives—in their lives are constantly criticizing them for not being open and vulnerable and intimate, all the while they are standing in front of that cramped wizard closet where their men are huddled inside, adjusting the curtain and making sure no one sees in and no one gets out. — location: [1159](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=1159) ^ref-52447

Shame resilience—the four elements we discussed in the previous chapter—is about finding a middle path, an option that allows us to stay engaged and to find the emotional courage we need to respond in a way that aligns with our values. — location: [1199](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=1199) ^ref-38900

Thankfully, we can apologize for shaming someone we love, but the truth is that those shaming comments leave marks. And shaming someone we love around vulnerability is the most serious of all security breaches. Even if we apologize, we’ve done serious damage because we’ve demonstrated our willingness to use sacred information as a weapon. — location: [1291](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=1291) ^ref-56272

believing that we’re “enough” is the way out of the armor—it gives us permission to take off the mask. With that sense of “enough” comes an embrace of worthiness, boundaries, and engagement. — location: [1406](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=1406) ^ref-50566

“The only reason we listened to you is because you’re just as bad at being open as we are. If you didn’t wrestle with being vulnerable, we wouldn’t trust you one bit.” — location: [1417](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=1417) ^ref-17397

These include foreboding joy, or the paradoxical dread that clamps down on momentary joyfulness; perfectionism, or believing that doing everything perfectly means you’ll never feel shame; and numbing, the embrace of whatever deadens the pain of discomfort and pain. — location: [1422](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=1422) ^ref-53854

I was convinced that I was the only one who stood over my children while they slept and, in the split second that I became engulfed with love and adoration, pictured something really terrible happening to them. — location: [1452](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=1452) ^ref-23827

“I used to think the best way to go through life was to expect the worst. That way, if it happened, you were prepared, and if it didn’t happen, you were pleasantly surprised. Then I was in a car accident and my wife was killed. Needless to say, expecting the worst didn’t prepare me at all. And worse, I still grieve for all of those wonderful moments we shared and that I didn’t fully enjoy. My commitment to her is to fully enjoy every moment now. I just wish she was here, now that I know how to do that.” — location: [1461](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=1461) ^ref-33222

“It’s easier to live disappointed than it is to feel disappointed. It feels more vulnerable to dip in and out of disappointment than to just set up camp there. You sacrifice joy, but you suffer less pain.” — location: [1468](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=1468) ^ref-46594

Participants described happiness as an emotion that’s connected to circumstances, and they described joy as a spiritual way of engaging with the world that’s connected to practicing gratitude. — location: [1500](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=1500) ^ref-39793

---
Scarcity and fear drive foreboding joy. We’re afraid that the feeling of joy won’t last, or that there won’t be enough, or that the transition to disappointment (or whatever is in store for us next) will be too difficult. We’ve learned that giving in to joy is, at best, setting ourselves up for disappointment and, at worst, inviting disaster. And we struggle with the worthiness issue. Do we deserve our joy, given our inadequacies and imperfections? What about the starving children and the war-ravaged world? Who are we to be joyful? — location: [1503](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=1503) ^ref-31332

---
But every time we allow ourselves to lean into joy and give in to those moments, we build resilience and we cultivate hope. The joy becomes part of who we are, and when bad things happen—and they do happen—we are stronger. — location: [1529](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=1529) ^ref-55580

her definition of mindfulness reminds us that being mindful also means not overidentifying with or exaggerating our feelings. For me, it’s so easy to get stuck in regret or shame or self-criticism when I make a mistake. But self-compassion requires an observant and accurate perspective when feeling shame or pain. — location: [1601](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=1601) ^ref-18980

I remind myself, “Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.” (Cribbed from Voltaire.) A twenty-minute walk that I do is better than the four-mile run that I don’t do. The imperfect book that gets published is better than the perfect book that never leaves my computer. The dinner party of take-out Chinese food is better than the elegant dinner that I never host. — location: [1614](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=1614) ^ref-61464

joy, belonging, creativity, and empathy. We can’t selectively numb emotion. Numb the dark and you numb the light. — location: [1662](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=1662) ^ref-59345

the most powerful need for numbing seems to come from combinations of all three—shame, anxiety, and disconnection. — location: [1677](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=1677) ^ref-8490

The anxiety described by the research participants appeared to be fueled by uncertainty, overwhelming and competing demands on our time, and (one of the big surprises) social discomfort. — location: [1678](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=1678) ^ref-59137

belief that if we were just smarter, stronger, or better, we’d be able to handle everything. Numbing here becomes a way to take the edge off of both instability and inadequacy. — location: [1686](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=1686) ^ref-57954

“We train our warriors to use controlled violence and aggression, to suppress strong emotional reactions in the face of adversity, to tolerate physical and emotional pain, and to overcome the fear of injury and death.

“Serpentining” means trying to control a situation, backing out of it, pretending it’s not happening, or maybe even pretending that you don’t care. — location: [2015](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=2015) ^ref-2589

As adults, we can also protect ourselves from vulnerability with cool. We worry about being perceived as laughing too loud, buying in, caring too much, being too eager. — location: [2051](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=2051) ^ref-32169

---
We disengage to protect ourselves from vulnerability, shame, and feeling lost and without purpose. We also disengage when we feel like the people who are leading us—our boss, our teachers, our principal, our clergy, our parents, our politicians—aren’t living up to their end of the social contract. — location: [2144](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=2144) ^ref-18957

The gap starts here: We can’t give people what we don’t have. Who we are matters immeasurably more than what we know or who we want to be. — location: [2157](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=2157) ^ref-40707

To reignite creativity, innovation, and learning, leaders must rehumanize education and work. This means understanding how scarcity is affecting the way we lead and work, learning how to engage with vulnerability, and recognizing and combating shame. — location: [2267](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=2267) ^ref-19506

Shame can only rise so far in any system before people disengage to protect themselves. When we’re disengaged, we don’t show up, we don’t contribute, and we stop caring. — location: [2331](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=2331) ^ref-19626

It really doesn't feel like any of this shame stuff is relevant in my job. We rely on ppls internalized fear of failure I guess

In an organizational culture where respect and the dignity of individuals are held as the highest values, shame and blame don’t work as management styles. There is no leading by fear. Empathy is a valued asset, accountability is an expectation rather than an exception, and the primal human need for belonging is not used as leverage and social control. — location: [2377](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=2377) ^ref-21054

We can’t control the behavior of individuals; however, we can cultivate organizational cultures where behaviors are not tolerated and people are held accountable for protecting what matters most: human beings. — location: [2379](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=2379) ^ref-65086

Normalizing is a critical shame-resilience strategy. Leaders and managers can cultivate engagement by helping people know what to expect. What are common struggles?

I can beat myself up for being too controlling and micromanaging, or I can recognize that I’m very responsible, dependable, and committed to quality work. The micromanaging issues don’t go away, but by viewing them from a strengths perspective, I have the confidence to look at myself and assess the behaviors I’d like to change. — location: [2425](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=2425) ^ref-25484

One of the greatest mistakes that I see people make in the feedback process is “armoring up.” To protect ourselves from the vulnerability of giving or receiving feedback, we get ready to rumble (cue Jock Jams). It’s easy to assume that the feedback process only feels vulnerable for the person receiving the feedback, but that’s not true. Honest engagement around expectations and behavior is always fraught with uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure for everyone involved. — location: [2441](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=2441) ^ref-37717

above all else we should strive to raise children who: Engage with the world from a place of worthiness Embrace their vulnerabilities and imperfections Feel a deep sense of love and compassion for themselves and others Value hard work, perseverance, and respect Carry a sense of authenticity and belonging with them, rather than searching for it in external places Have the courage to be imperfect, vulnerable, and creative Don’t fear feeling ashamed or unlovable if they are different or if they are struggling Move through our rapidly changing world with courage and a resilient spirit — location: [2632](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=2632) ^ref-27697

The important thing to know about worthiness is that it doesn’t have prerequisites. Most of us, on the other hand, have a long list of worthiness prerequisites—qualifiers that we’ve inherited, learned, and unknowingly picked up along the way. Most of these prerequisites fall in the categories of accomplishments, acquisitions, and external acceptance. It’s the if/when problem (“I’ll be worthy when…” or “I’ll be worthy if…”). — location: [2658](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=2658) ^ref-7886

“When my children used to walk in the room when they were little, I looked at them to see if they had buckled their trousers or if their hair was combed or if their socks were up.…You think your affection and your deep love is on display because you’re caring for them. It’s not. When they see you, they see the critical face. What’s wrong now?” Her advice was simple, but paradigm-shifting for me. She said, “Let your face speak what’s in your heart. When they walk in the room my face says I’m glad to see them. It’s just as small as that, you see?” — location: [2693](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=2693) ^ref-55049

---
I literally think about that advice every day—it’s become a practice. When Ellen comes bounding down the stairs dressed for school, I don’t want my first comment to be “Pull your hair back” or “Those shoes don’t match your dress.” I want my face to convey how happy I am to see her—to be with her. When Charlie comes in the back door and he’s sweaty and dirty from catching lizards, I want to flash a smile before I say, “Don’t touch anything until you wash your hands.” So often we think that we earn parenting points by being critical, put out, and exasperated. Those first looks can be prerequisites or worthiness-builders. I don’t want to criticize when my kids walk in the room, I want to light up! — location: [2697](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=2697) ^ref-25195

---
I’m convinced that the reason most of us revert back to feeling childlike and small when we’re in shame is because our brain stores our early shame experiences as trauma, and when it’s triggered we return to that place. — location: [2722](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007P7HRS4&location=2722) ^ref-54341

If you have grown children and are wondering if it’s too late to teach shame resilience or to change the album, the answer is no. It’s not too late.
