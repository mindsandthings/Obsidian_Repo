Sonke Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes:

"Whenever you read something, make notes about the content. Write down what you don't want to forget or think you might use in your own thinking or writing. Keep it very short, be extremely selective, and use your own words."

Make permanent notes by reviewing that info and developing ideas, arguments, and discussions. Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else (full sentences, dislclose courses, make references, try to be as precise, clear, and brief as possible). 

When writing, look for chains of notes that have developed. 




Critical to distinguish between:
1. Fleeting notes; trash with a day or two. For capturing ideas quickly while you are doing something else. Review within a day or so and turn into proper notes. 
2. Permanent notes: never trashed, contain all necessary info within themselves in a permanently understandable way, always stored the same way in the same place. Literature notes in reference system; main notes in slip-box. 
3. Project notes: relevant only to one project; kept within a specific folder and can be trashed or archived afterward. Might be comments in the manuscript, collections of project-related literature, outlines, snippets of drafts, reminders, to-do lists, and the draft itself. 

In zotero you can make project-specific folders and keep a reference in both that and the main place.
