# Budgeting info Mar 2020
Goal of budgeting:  
* Understand how we spend money 

* Understand what we could cut if we lost our income 


What do we spend money on? 
* $18k: rent. 

	* No way to reduce this 

* $15k. Medical expenses: chiropractor and other doctors $6k, therapy $5k, personal trainer $2.5k. Plan to cut personal trainer. 

	* If necessary, we could reduce or eliminate therapy. Chiropractor should become less frequent on its own, but no pressure. savings not linear bcs we'd be cutting the post-deductible trips first.  

* $10k+: donations: 

	* Could cut entirely, if we have literally no income 

* $10k: food: Food costs have gone up over time, almost entirely due to restaurant spending (some of that is spurious because it was reimbursed but the reimbursement wasn't categorized).  

	* We'll look at grocery receipts at some point and understand where we're spending the most money 

	* Could reduce restaurants by $2k pretty easily by not ordering out for dates. Could reduce grocery bill by $2k, estimated. No pressure to do this right now.  

* $4k: utilities: We're paying reasonable prices for phone, internet, and electricity. We could cut electricity usage by running the heat less but that would be a lot of pain to save a few hundred dollars. 

* $2k: Electronics and software: Half of this is 2 new phones. But we didn't buy any other new devices or computers this year, so it may be around average.  

	* If we need to, we can buy cheaper devices next time we need to replace.  

* $1.5k: clothing 

	* Could cut, but this isn't extravagant. Most of it is actually shoes, which are a very good investment 

* $3k: transportation. $500 is Muni/BART and the rest is uber/lyft.  

	* Could cut uber/lyft a little but they're pretty important QoL.  

* $3k: air travel and hotels/airbnb 

	* Could cut this if necessary 

* $3k: entertainment. Half of this is e's entertainment budget and the other half is high-value things like spotify and netflix.  

	* IMO this would be a poor place to cut in terms of utility per dollar.  

* $1.2k: ASL classes 


Total annual expenditures ~$80k. This doesn't include anything we pay for pre-tax, which is primarily medical insurance premiums.  

In sum, we could probably cut about $10k in expenses if we needed to, nearly all from personal trainer / therapist / chiropractor or food. We could also cut $10k in donations. Everything else is either at a reasonable minimum, or a drop in the bucket. This would be a total reduction of ~25%.
