The mail-order medication is through CVS Caremark

1. Does Elizabeth sign up for an online account for the blueshieldca website or do we use the same account?
2. Does Elizabeth sign up for a separate CVS Caremark account or do we use the same account? 
3. What information do we give our health providers so they can prescribe mail-order prescriptions?
4. Are psychotherapy and psychiatrist / psych NP visits provided via videoconferencing considered office visits, or are they considered "Teladoc"? Is this the same for in and out of network?
5. Does "Tier 1" on the website mean "participating provider" and Tier 2 mean everythign else?
