# BCBS Blue Shield insurance questions

1. Does Elizabeth sign up for an online account for the blueshieldca website or do we use the same account?

Get her own account. Go to the site and register with our shared ID number, but put in her birthdate. 


2. Does Elizabeth sign up for a separate CVS Caremark account or do we use the same account?

Separate account. If you've had one before, call them and give your new info. If you haven't, call them anyway. If they give us trouble, call the Blue Shield line and they might be able to mediate.


3. What information do we give our health providers so they can prescribe mail-order prescriptions?

Just the phone and fax number for CVS caremark. If you want a 90 day prescription, instruct the doctor to ask for that. If it's not allowed caremark will let you know. 

4. Are psychotherapy and psychiatrist / psych NP visits provided via videoconferencing considered office visits, or are they considered "Teladoc"? Is this the same for in and out of network?

"Teladoc" is specific to the Teladoc service. It doesn't apply to all telehealth. And the reason there's no coverage for OON Teladoc is that there's no such thing. For mental health, we have coverage as listed and it's the same whether it's in person or remote. 

5. Does "Tier 1" on the website mean "participating provider" and Tier 2 mean everythign else?

"participating" and "non-participating" mean the same thing as in-network and OON. There are no provider tiers on our plan, just drug tiers which are totally unrelated. 

6. Does out-of-pocket spending on OON mental health count towards our deductible? 

Yes, but only up to the allowed amount for that type of care (and we do need to submit a superbill for it).
