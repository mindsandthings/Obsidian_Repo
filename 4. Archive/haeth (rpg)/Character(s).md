Peddler: Coco the Crocodile (he/him)

2 things you are: extroverted, sustainable

2 things you feel you need to be: stern, watchful

Coco's goal/motivation is to find the right things and the right people to sell them to so that people have things that are meaningful or helpful or both. 

Your look: 
- Overburdened backpack (huge black duffel bag, many velcroed flaps revealing shelves of plastic divided boxes)
- Patched-up mustard cloak (bag has its own cloak)
- Once-fancy hat (mustard, clearly been stepped on a few times)

A sturdy and resolute beetle who carries my supplies on its back: Clickso. Clickso has a matching cloak too. Outfits for the whole family
Clickso is sturdy and resolution:
* Sturdy: can alwys support somethign in dnger of collapse, or push something concerning aside  
* Resolute: can always keep at something that others would give up at, and refuse to yield under pressure

Coco sells small things, the useful and the useless:
- Nails, tools, and anything else forged from melted-down weapons.
- Knickknacks, tchotchkes, and any other useless trinkets.
- Incense, statues, and anything else that appeases the many small and forgotten gods.
- Clouds, dreams, or any other miracles that no one else could offer.

One thing you would never abandon, one you parted with a long time ago:
- \[Never abandon\] Zo (they/them), a small and forgotten miraculous god who lives in a shrine on your beetle. Zo has a mustard cloak but uses it as curtains for the shrine. 
- \[Parted with a long time ago\] A sealed box you’ve sworn never to open, gifted to you by your old trademaster when you first set off. I gave it away; the easiest way not to open something is to no longer have it. I asked Zo to help me find someone's heart's desire, and Zo said it was in the box. I asked Zo to find my heart's desire, and Zo said it was in the journey: a process, not a thing.

Zo is Miraculous: can always offer to grant someone's wish in a way that won't work out how they want. If they want to reject your offer they're going to need to spend a token. 


- Has nicknamed Rock "Pebble"
- 


Ask 1 to the left and 1 to the right.
- How do I help you decompress when the days are long?
	- Rock: a good story about places he's gone, things he's sold, people he's met. 
- Why did we start traveling together, all those years ago?
- What do you give me that I can’t get anywhere else?
- Are you still working with me?
	- Flare: yes, though dubious about the selling aspect

Some things you can always do:
- Know someone who can help.
- Intensely examine something.
- Sit down and do the math.
- Trade for or trade away one of your many wares.
- Ask: “What can I do for you?”
- Say: “I have a deal for you.” Give them a token if they hear you out and consider it.

During each seasonal holiday, choose 1 you haven’t chosen before:
- Change the wares you barter with or value.
- Change the wares you barter with or value, again.
- Procure the perfect gift for someone, and give it to them.
- Procure the perfect gift for someone, and give it to them.
- Get a token whenever you give something away and expect nothing in return.
- Spend a token to acquire something rare, valuable, or important.
- You can always run into an old friend in an unexpected place.
- Take an unused playbook and add as much as you want from that playbook to yours.
- You’re taking a break from traveling, setting up shop somewhere a bit more permanent. Pick up a new playbook and make a new character.
