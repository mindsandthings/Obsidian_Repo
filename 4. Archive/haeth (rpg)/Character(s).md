Peddler: Coco the Crocodile

2 things you are: extroverted, sustainable

2 things you feel you need to be: stern, watchful

Your look:

--Overburdened backpack (huge black duffel bag, many velcroed flaps revealing shelves of plastic divided boxes)

--Patched-up mustard cloak (bag has its own cloak)

--Once-fancy hat (mustard, clearly been stepped on a few times)

A sturdy and resolute beetle who carries my supplies on its back: Clickso. Clickso has a matching cloak too. Outfits for the whole family

4 wares: I sell small things, the useful and the useless

--Nails, tools, and anything else forged from melted-down weapons.

--Knickknacks, tchotchkes, and any other useless trinkets.

--Incense, statues, and anything else that appeases the many small and forgotten gods.

--\[My favorite\] Clouds, dreams, or any other miracles that no one else could offer.

One thing you would never abandon, one you parted with a long time ago:

--\[Never abandon\] Zo, a small and forgotten miraculous god who lives in a shrine on your beetle. Zo has a mustard cloak but uses it as curtains for the shrine. 

--\[Parted with a long time ago\] A sealed box you’ve sworn never to open, gifted to you by your old trademaster when you first set off. I gave it away; the easiest way not to open something is to no longer have it. I asked Zo to help me find someone's heart's desire, and Zo said it was in the box. I asked Zo to find my heart's desire, and Zo said it was in the journey: a process, not a thing.
