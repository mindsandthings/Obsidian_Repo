[Buy Me Once](https://href.li/?https://buymeonce.com/?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=Dynamic-Search&utm_content=114010948253&utm_term=&gclid=Cj0KCQjwspKUBhCvARIsAB2IYuuL3Ub9WH4xyMYWQpjmucoqhLIkCd1-KXc8jfwvt3TsR5_jAt2sT4EaAn38EALw_wcB) is a website that sells products that, uh, you only have to buy once. They have razors, duvets, kitchenwear, hosiery, gardening toolsâ€”all that are designed to last as long as physically possible. Hell, they have a smartphone ($200, 4 year warranty) and a VACUUM, both made to never be replaced. A lot of these things are also self-serviceable (looking at you Apple).

There are other sites out there like this, but this is the one I know is reputable. There are also some clothing companies like Eddie Bauer, Uniqlo, LandsEnd, and Duluth Trading Post that all sell durable, reliable clothing. In Uniqlo's case, they're also recycling materials and creating innovative new ways to sew clothes, [including just not sewing them at all.](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uniqlo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fnews%2Fsp%2Ftopics%2F2018090601%2F&t=MDQxYjQ2ZmMxN2JlMGFmMzZhYzQ0YmUxY2E5NzBhNDEzMzZhMzRmMCw2azVBS25KWQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AfQTjk98tpE4TpwDx9IHjTQ&p=https%3A%2F%2Fheadspace-hotel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F690453166164213760&m=1&ts=1658513427)
