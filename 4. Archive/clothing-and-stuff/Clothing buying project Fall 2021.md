Marcella NYC, Alix NYC, Enza Costa, and Karen Millen all come to mind. But yeah, these brands are harder to find and often more expensive. That works for me because I can buy less and pay more for better quality these days—but I know that’s not the case for everyone.

Modern minimalist, you would love COS (part of H&M group). It has super comfortable clothes, nothing flashy but tailoring is on point. Love their knitwear and dresses.

For a touch of boho, I often go to &OtherStories. Another part of the H&M group. I love their modern approach to boho more than Free People or Anthropology. 

In my experience, shop B Corp. If they aren't a B Corp they could be green washing. Everything I own from patagonia, allbirds, girlfriend, athleta, tentree, marine layer are all fantastic and have held up great.

I've worked for two B Corps and I can confirm they are held to very high standards to keep that certification.

Also most of these are all mid-range prices. Reformation is ridiculously expensive and doesn't look high quality to me at all.

I hope this comment doesn't get buried because I think more people should know about B Corps.
