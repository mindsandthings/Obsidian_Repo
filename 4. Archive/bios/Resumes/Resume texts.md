Elizabeth is an informatics analyst, data manager, neurocritic, writer, and sometimes researcher. She writes and thinks a lot about autism, disability, fiction, and behavioral science. She helps run the #autchat and #neurodiverseSTEM hashtag chats on Twitter, and is developing a research project on autistic adults' experiences of empathy and you can read the Storified livetweets here.
 
I work at UCSF as a data manager and sometimes-project coordinator, usually for research studies. My background is in social psychology and information science (MS in each), and during graduate school at the University of Michigan I did autism research, including a project in collaboration with Uta Frith at University College London looking at development of race and gender stereotypes in autistic children.  My information science program included some qualitative research training based on semiformal interviews. I'm currently developing an independent crowd-funded project looking at autistic adults' subjective experiences with empathy. Outside of work, I am an autistic autism advocate and have various contacts in the online disability community.

Resume
Multidisciplinary data manager and project coordinator with background in behavioral science and user interface design.  
I bridge quantitative needs (survey design and implementation, data processing, cleaning, logic checks, analyses) with human ones (documentation, organization, visualizations and reports, project coordination and management). 
 
General tech person. 
 
I have worked on multiple health research studies at USCF involving participants with chronic health conditions, and developed an electronic intake form for a community clinic.  I have typically worked on teams, often in collaboration with a community partner organization. I am often the "tech person" for a team: I clean and manage data, run statistics and provide reports, and document datasets, syntax, and procedures.  I have experience managing a study database and developing reports for other people to run.  I also implement data collection websites/surveys and program computer-assisted interviews, and write and edit reports and presentations.
