I grew up in Knoxville, Tennessee, home of the Body Farm. 

When I was a kid, my mother and I would drive two days to visit my grandmother in Columbus, Texas. To entertain her while driving, she had me read mystery novels, particularly Sue Grafton's alphabet series. After I was old enough to drive, she read them to me. That's where my interest in mysteries started. 

I took Gotham's Science Fiction and Fantasy II course last semester, along with several other people in this course (Tara, John, and Miriam). I wrote a fantastic noir short story featuring a private eye, intelligent sparkly ponies, intelligent octopuses, and a future society that modeled itself after 1950s television shows. I'm hoping to write more in that universe. 

I currently write part-time and will be attending the Clarion West writers workshop this summer. I previously worked as a data manager, using statistical programming to clean large data sets. I'd like to write a mystery story about data management although real-life resolutions to data irregularities often lack narrative excitement ("the research assistant stapled a page of the questionnaire on backward," "hidden empty columns in Excel cause disasters," "someone recoded both multiple-choice answers to this question to the same value"). 

I've also participated in a major project on research studies' failures to replicate, and know there's a mystery story in there somewhere! 

One of my interests is autistic characters in fiction. I've published several articles on that including a broad review. I'd like to do something new with the "autistic detective" stereotype, but haven't figured out what.
