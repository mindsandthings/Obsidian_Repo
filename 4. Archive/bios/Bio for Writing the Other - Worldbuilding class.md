Hi! I'm working on a humor fantasy novel set in a malfunctioning magical theme park run by faeries for human tourists. It has an adventure/rescue plot and themes of personhood, identity, and neurodivergence. 

The action takes place mostly in abandoned park attractions, and I'm thinking a lot about worldbuilding questions like accessibility and how disabilities might be seen in the cultures of the faeries who designed the park attractions (and what options this offers for saying things I would like to say about disability to readers). 

I also want to avoid having my characters all come off as coded white/USian/middle-class, and to make more-informed decisions about the park's bureaucratic and economic structure and the social and cultural environments of its employees, who are multicultural and mostly-but-not-all faerie. My primary interest in this class is in getting better tools for thinking about that. 

A lot of people are sharing demographic stuff: I'm white, USian, middle-class background, late 30s. Demographic/identity stuff that I bring into my worldbuilding and writing on purpose: Having been homeschooled in a way that left me with weird patchy cultural/social/academic knowledge; being queer; being autistic and disabled in other ways; an academic background in cultural/evolutionary/developmental/social psychology, and in user experience design.
