Hi all! I'm Elizabeth. I just finished Clarion West and am transitioning back to everyday life. I live in the SF Bay Area and write mostly humor spec fic. I'm interested in disability representation and have published several articles at Disability in Kid Lit on autistic characters in fiction. 
 
I started writing seriously again last year after a long break and am now writing full-time. Before that I did various things related to behavioral science research and/or technology. 
 
I like to play video games, especially puzzle games and walking simulators. I'm @theoriesofminds on twitter, where I talk about writing stuff and my life and also do disability advocacy, mostly autism-related.
