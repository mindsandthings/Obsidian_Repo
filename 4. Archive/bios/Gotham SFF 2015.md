I'm a part-time data manager and part-time editor and writer. Reading speculative fiction is part of a family tradition for me, and I vowed at age 13 to become a spec fic writer when I grew up. Over 20 years later and after a lengthy set of detours through research psychology, user experience design, logistics, museum education planning, project coordination, and data management, I'm working on my original dream again. Luckily, I was able to read hundreds of science fiction and fantasy novels despite all the detours. I also managed to be part of a genre writers group for several years during graduate school, where I started a YA fantasy novel about kids recovering from interpersonal trauma and having adventures. I recently picked it back up and just hit the 1/4 mark. I'm planning to write more adult-oriented fiction in this course, and made a personal commitment to writing two short stories (no matter how bad) and submitting them for publication by the end of the calendar year.
