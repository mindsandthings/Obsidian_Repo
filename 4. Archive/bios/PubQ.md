Hi, I am Elizabeth. I live in the Bay Area and am working on a comedy fantasy novel in which a poorly paid human intern recently ascended to folk hero and her friend, a curmudgeonly faerie princess who ran away from home to become a programmer, have adventures in a malfunctioning magical theme park run by faeries for human tourists.
