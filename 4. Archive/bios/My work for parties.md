(2016)

I write fantasy humor with some underlying social commentary. 
 
Currently working on a comedy fantasy novel in which a poorly paid human intern recently ascended to folk hero and her friend, a curmudgeonly faerie princess who ran away from home to become a programmer, have adventures in a malfunctioning magical theme park run by faeries for human tourists.
 
 
A fantasy humor novel about a college intern who tests badly written software for opening magic doors. 
 
 
A shy homeschooled girl is given a pair of magic sparkly miniature ponies for her birthday. They learn to trust each other, then go on a crime spree. 
 
 
 
Describe your work in terms of things people will relate to. Like a fantasy novel about bug reports! The heroine is a college intern who deals with malfunctioning software for opening magic gates. One day their vendor's software-as-a-service breaks down and every time she files a bug report, it starts creating actual bugs. But it all turns around when they pupate into telepathic carnivorous butterflies and ask her to be their leader.
 
 
 
You can also talk about being a sensitivity reader if you want. I think people would find that pretty interesting and it's a way to make yourself sound less artsy if you want to. 
 
You can also talk about how you were in psych grad school until you decided to leave and study UX. You can tell stories about bad advisors (like with your dissertation prospectus) or just give a "you know what it's like"
