I'm a part-time data manager and part-time editor and writer. I also do disability advocacy, mostly autism-focused, and have published a couple related articles on autistic characters in kid lit and am working on a third. I'm editing a commissioned anthology with writings by late-diagnosed autistic adults, and recently restarted work on a YA novel I began in 2008, an SFF book about kids recovering from interpersonal trauma and having adventures. I have not yet published any fiction, but am dead-set on writing, submitting, rewriting, and repeating until I make it happen. 

My previous background is in research psychology, where I studied culture and cognition, and information science, where I focused on user experience design for software and websites. 

I was homeschooled as a kid and my high school education included reading large chunks of my family's extensive library of SFF paperbacks. I've read a lot more kid lit an adult than I did as a kid! I'm taking this class to broaden my knowledge of kid lit and to get more practice writing it.
