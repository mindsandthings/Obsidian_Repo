Short bio (50-100 words) in third person that I can use to introduce you to my readers: 
	•	Autistic advocacy including autism-related nonfiction under Elizabeth Bartmess and edited book
	•	I'm a part-time data manager and part-time editor and writer. Reading speculative fiction is part of a family tradition for me, and I vowed at age 13 to become a spec fic writer when I grew up. Over 20 years later and after a lengthy set of detours through research psychology, user experience design, logistics, museum education planning, project coordination, and data management, I'm working on my original dream again. Luckily, I was able to read hundreds of science fiction and fantasy novels despite all the detours. I also managed to be part of a genre writers group for several years during graduate school, where I started a YA fantasy novel about kids recovering from interpersonal trauma and having adventures. I recently picked it back up and just hit the 1/4 mark. I'm planning to write more adult-oriented fiction in this course, and made a personal commitment to writing two short stories (no matter how bad) and submitting them for publication by the end of the calendar year.

Pick 5 questions: 

 - Some cover art or other artwork associated with something you've published recently (only if you have some at hand that you'd like me to display in the interview; it's fine if you don't have this, or don't want to).

There isn't a super-firm deadline for this, but obviously the interviews will be published in April, so it would be very useful to have the questions by then. If you could get them to me by March 15, this will be helpful as it allows me to schedule the interviews further in advance and make sure that the schedule fits together correctly. I'll send a reminder to people who haven't finished their interviews yet, some time shortly after the 15th, but if you squeak in later than that deadline, I can still fit you in.

Here are the questions:

1. Tell me about a recent work you released - a short story, a poem, a book, a game. What one work of yours do you hope readers will go out and read today? What's it about?
	•	I'm working on a novel but
	•	Only fiction work I have published is the Octopus one, in which an octopus robs a knitting shop, for love. 
	•	Edited book? TPGA?

2. When you were learning to write, did you have non-neurotypical authors to look up to? Are there non-neurotypical authors you look up to now? Tell me about them, or if the answer to both is "no," tell me about someone else you look up to.
	•	Yes although I didn't always know it at the time - doubt I know it even now - a lot of it would just be speculation
	•	13, decided I wanted to be a writer [though not same as learning, which has taken place continuously since I was a kid] 
	⁃	- JMS [check timeline - was there time for this?]. Speculate about what about B5 did this - I don't know. I wish I could remember what inspired me so much but clearly I connected with something in it
	⁃	Doris Piserchia whose heroines read as clearly neurodivergent to me [but: appropriation and stereotypes of Native Americans]
	•	But also: online twitter people. Not fiction but autistic people putting their stories out there, which is a way of saying that we matter

3. What do you enjoy most about writing?



	•	The fuzzy nature of of it. I did data management previously, and data management is much more linear and straightforward compared to writing. Writing involves an extremely wide range of skills
	•	That can be intensely frustrating, but it means there are always new skills to learn, and they can be very different kinds of skills. 
	•	As far as specific aspects of writing goes, I enjoy the parts of characterization that involve thinking about how characters relate to people around them. Do they think of other people as opportunities? Threats? Roadblocks? How have their experiences and abilities lead them to see other people that way? When someone else is an exception for them, why? 

4. What is most difficult for you about writing?



9. Do you have any writing advice for other autistic people?

My advice will probably be most relevant to newer writers

Fiction-writing is a form of communication, and if you 

People are much less likely 

	•	A lot of advice about writing process is just really bad, or really irrelevant to you
	•	You'll get a lot of bad advice
	•	People will say stuff in critique that hurts you; be prepared. Communication trauma. 
	•	
	•	

5. Tell me about a special interest of yours. Have you found yourself incorporating your special interests into your fiction?

6. What one thing do you wish more speculative fiction readers knew about autism?

7. Have you had trouble with the publishing industry because of being autistic, and/or because of being marginalized in another way?

8. What's the biggest thing about the publishing industry that you wish would change?



10. What question do you wish interviews like these would ask? Answer it here.

Thank you again!

Best,
Ada

	Hi Noe,

Sorry, I forgot one more thing - if I could also have a short bio (50-100 words) in third person that I can use to introduce you to my readers, that'd be splendid.

Best,
Ada (actually Jacqueline :P)
to me
Hi Noe,

Thank you for offering to participate in an interview! I've worked up a set of 10 interview questions. I'm giving everyone this same set of 10 questions, and I'd like you to pick five of them to answer - any five, although I imagine you will probably want to answer question 1 in particular :)

In addition to the interview questions, I'd like you to tell me the following:

 - The name you'd like me to call you in the interview, and your pronouns
 - Would you be okay with your interview being an exclusive interview for subscribers only? This means that it would be behind a paywall, and subscribers of my Substack would be able to view it. I won't put anyone's interview behind a paywall in this manner unless they explicitly tell me I can.

And, optionally, I'd like you to send:

 - A picture of yourself that you'd like me to use with the published interview (only if you're comfortable with that); and/or
 - Some cover art or other artwork associated with something you've published recently (only if you have some at hand that you'd like me to display in the interview; it's fine if you don't have this, or don't want to).

There isn't a super-firm deadline for this, but obviously the interviews will be published in April, so it would be very useful to have the questions by then. If you could get them to me by March 15, this will be helpful as it allows me to schedule the interviews further in advance and make sure that the schedule fits together correctly.
