I did Clarion West this summer, was planning to wait on starting a thread till getting something accepted for publication, decided to start it anyway. 

Current projects:

1) A humor fantasy novel. I did the first draft for nanowrimo and am now expanding the plot, developing the characters, incorporating more humor. 

2) A non-fiction anthology by and for adult-diagnosed autistic people. I've got about half the submissions in and edited. 

3) Miscellaneous short stories and novellas, mostly on hold while I focus on the first two projects. 

Some nonfiction stuff I've written:

I started writing seriously again last year after a long break and am now writing full-time. Before that I did various things related to behavioral science research and/or technology. 
 
I like to play video games, especially puzzle games and walking simulators. I'm @theoriesofminds on twitter, where I talk about writing stuff and my life and also do disability advocacy, mostly autism-related.
