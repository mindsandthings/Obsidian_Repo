I write humorous/quirky fantasy with some serious themes and a strong focus on characterization. I'm interested in how neurodivergence affects how people think and interact, both in fiction and real life; I ran weekly chats for Twitter's autistic community for five years and have published pieces on autistic representation in fiction.

I worked as a project manager and data manager before leaving the workforce in 2015 due to disabling health issues. I was recently correctly diagnosed and treated, and gained a lot of capacity for change that I didn't have before. I read the Quitbooks in June and have made and sustained some large changes to my life as a result.

I'm working on the second draft of a novel and looking into adding part-time freelancing. I have one published short story, some unpublished ones, and two abandoned novels.

Demographics: early 40s, married, no kids, spouse supports me financially. Autistic/ADHD/misc, academic background in behavioral science and information science.

Am I stuck because I don't know what's happening next, or because I'm not clear on what's happening now?

My goals for the strengths course are 1) try new ways to address complex information management issues that come up around , 2) come up with better strategies for getting useful feedback from early readers, and 3) figure out more sustainable ways to learn and incorporate writing advice.

In late 2015, I had to stop working due to undiagnosed physical health issues, and focused on writing fiction. I published one short story and wrote multiple drafts of a novel, which I later shelved. Last year I was correctly diagnosed and treated,

My WIP's protagonists

I previously edited a nonfiction anthology of pieces by adult-diagnosed autistic people, and have published essays on representation of autistic characters in fiction, and

Before reading the Quit books, I would have said I wrote a little slower than average. Now I would describe my pace as glacial.

When writing, I like exploring

I think that what I enjoy reading and writing may not

I live in the Bay Area and have been writing seriously

My academic background is in information science (user experience research and design) and behavioral science (cultural/evolutionary and developmental psychology, social cognition, and cognitive anthropology).

My writing process consists of having a lot of associations, putting them all down on the page, and trying drag a linear narrative out of them.

Generally I have found

I think about characters, situations, backstory, and settings as complex patterns or webs of associated facts.

I can't write without a clear, detailed outline, but I can't stick to an outline when I have one.

I've accepted that I'll never write quickly, but I would like to

The need of a story is to have necessary backstory and exposition in place at the right times; the need of a scene is avoid almost all backstory and exposition.

In the last year and especially the last 3 months, I've had major health improvements that created a lot of capacity to change, and in the last couple months I've begun walking 5,000-10,000 steps a day and

1) Information management issues due to the way I think (patterns to linear). Another is that the patterns of character tendencies are abstracted from a lot of different people, meaning that it's possible to pull on those broad patterns but wind up with an internally contradictory specific person. I can specify it, but it takes a lot of words, and then I have to remember what

it's difficult to identify at the time I'm writing something whether it's a feature that should be recorded and set in stone, and it's difficult to identify the level of specificity I need to be able to anticipate what I'll need to know in the future—especially because \*what I'm drawing on\* and will need in the future is actually not supposed to go on the page and is still malleable!

another problem: when I postpone solving a problem to a future draft, it's because I don't know how to fix it yet, not because it's an optional problem.

1.5) Plotting and information management issues due to combo of poor memory and discovery writing—slow memory means I forget which specific parts of the pattern I'm drawing on, or accidentally forget details and cause plot holes—if I knew what would be relevant at the time I was writing it I could put it in reference material, or

trying to ensure consistency also results in scenes that satisfice—if a chunk of writing has been carefully tweaked to do five different necessary things, anything that replaces it also has to meet those needs

I do a lot of reverse outlining to try to figure out what's essential and what's not

2) Responding to feedback issues (both practical issue of how to get utility out of feedback, and the can't keep writing like this issue, and the bigger issue that agents and editors are going to raise the same concerns)

\-\- dislike of characters' neurodivergent traits framed as craft issue

\-\- lack of attention to pattern: what people advise changing or cutting would cause the coherence of the characters/plot to disintegrate

\-\- no space to put explanation in without making it clear why I'm explaining, but definitely no space to put the explanation in

\-\- no space for anything not immediately relevant to the action, making it very hard to acquaint readers with anything they don't already understand

I have to explain characters to make them comprehensible but people don't want explanations. If I don't put in the explanations, they complain that the characters don't make sense.

I don't think people who bring these up are completely wrong, but they're not able to tell me how

I want to use feedback to help me do what I want to do better.

more broadly it's just hard to engage in learning environments when "what humans/readers/characters do" is universalized

3) the difference between a rapid judgment and a very slow thorough judgment

When I try to fit this complexity into a story, I wind up with a huge information management problem. When I try to avoid putting complexity into a story, it winds up in there anyway. Either way, I can't

I have difficulty with managing exposition and backstory because my understanding of a character (or a situation) is an in-depth set of patterns or a complex web of associations, but it has to be told linearly on the page and trickled out in small, dispersed single facts—but rapidly enough and efficiently enough that

I have found that when I ask for

The need to justify my characters' decisions and actions, but without asking readers to consider that

The overwhelming focus in most critique on individual scenes without reference to the whole makes it very very hard to produce consistency
