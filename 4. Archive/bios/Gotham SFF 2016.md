I was unschooled growing up and was largely raised by books. Luckily, my family had a large speculative fiction collection. When I was thirteen, I promised myself I would become a speculative fiction writer when I grew up. Over 20 years later and after a lengthy set of career detours through research psychology, user experience design, logistics, museum education planning, project coordination, and data management, I've picked up that  dream again. 

My writing-related interests include autistic characters (I recently wrote a major review of this), disability more generally, historical magical practices in Judaism, and homeschooled characters. 

My goal for this course is to get two short stories in sufficient shape to apply to Clarion.
