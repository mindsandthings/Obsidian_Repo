# endever and ED
- check back in with endever on ED stuff
-
one of our "bottom lines" we talked about is we want to not get so low on intake that we stop absorbing antipsychotics the way we did last relapse that took us to hospital, so if you happen to see us mentioning that that's in danger that would be a point you could remind us of, like, "i remember you said this was one of your boundaries this time around, if you're having trouble with it do you want to set an emergency psychiatrist appointment to switch to a different antipsychotic?" or something would be fine. and in the meantime if we start cutting out asl feel free to remind us that ~30 minutes/day will not detract significantly from ana stuff and logically we'd rather be skinny + fluent than skinny + struggling to express ourselves *laughcryface*
 
 
### does cutting out asl mean cutting out the daily practice stuff?
### 12:10 PM
### yay ty :) you are so great about being supportive in careful yet effective ways
### yes :)

### (and weekly meetups if i start missing a bunch of those)
 
 
### awesome sounds good :) friends is good! although for 3rd person purposes pretending we're a singlet is still probably best. ahaha dw WE are bad at noticing if you are interacting with anyone other than endever* lol!
### generally endever* is almost always fronting but with other people rotating through often as cofronters
### so it's very possible you're talking to more than one of us at any moment but we might not be actively aware of it either lol
