I think cross-platform is a good move as our tools progress. There are already so many tools confined to Windows only (or Mac only, I suppose, but I don't notice those, being a Mac user), that at the very least implementation being possible on both platforms seems ideal. 

  
I'm not sure I'd call myself a "developer". I index using Cindex on Mac. On the Mac, there is already a community of indexers who use Keyboard Maestro for their macros. There's a modest mailing list of those indexers hosted on the [groups.io](http://groups.io) platform.

  
I also have used Margaret's macros in Cindex (on Windows), Macrex, and Sky. I believe there are other Cindex-Mac users who use QuickKeys but it's not supported by the Mac operating system anymore.

  

I wouldn't say the macros I've been able to dream up are quite as sophisticated and flawless as the Megabit Macros are/were. 

  

In my opinion, AHK is a good choice for Windows use. Maestro Express is very complicated to a non-tech-oriented user (aka me), whereas I am able to design my macros in Keyboard Maestro with **very**​ little expertise. I've poked around with some AHK and feel confident someone with my skill level could figure it out if they needed to.
