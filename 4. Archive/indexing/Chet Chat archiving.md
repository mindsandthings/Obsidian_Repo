**Archiving Macrex Chat Logs**

1. Make a folder on your hard drive and download the logs to it when they're emailed to you by chat hosts.

  

2. Standard naming format: Chet Chat 6-23-22 log. [Note: We call it "Chet Chat" because Chet Wehe was Gale's computer apprentice who set up the original chat years ago! He was the one who got us into her computer system after she passed away.]

  

3. Open each file with Word. I like to delete the instructions paragraph at the beginning of the log for easier reading.

If a log is in txt format, save as a docx file.

  

4. In Evernote, go to the Shared notebook "Macrex Office Hours." Find the note for the six-month period into which your log goes.

  

5. Open Windows Explorer to the folder where you've stored the logs.

  

6. Drag each log into the Evernote note in date order.

  

Thank you again so much for doing this job, Elizabeth! There's a lot of gold in these logs, and people do look at them. I appreciate having one responsibility off my shoulders!!
