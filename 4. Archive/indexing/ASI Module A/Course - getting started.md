## Welcome to Indexer Training!

Our course is offered entirely online. Please visit our website at [www.asindexing.org](http://www.asindexing.org/). Log on with your member ID and password. You will then see a tab at the top that says Training. You'll want to start with "How I Index." Then move to Module A:Â  Introducing Indexing.

You will see "[Register](https://www.classmarker.com/register/) for the quizzes or [login](https://www.classmarker.com/) to the quizzes." To do so, you'll need your ClassMarker registration code: 3N422059090MV.

For your exam, you'll need your Training Program student ID: 20220722-1.

Please make a note of this number. When you submit each exam, you will be known only by your ID to the exam markers.

Your registration includes the Module A exam, and you should wait until you complete the course materials before you download the test.

Follow the directions online as you move through the course. If you have any administrative questions, please contact ASI's Executive Director [Gwen Henson](mailto:gwenhenson@asindexing.org).
