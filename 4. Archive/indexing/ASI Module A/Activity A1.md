Activity A1

Look at as many indexes as possible, in your local library or your own collection, to

see how different forms of entry and layout are used. Pay particular attention to the

following, all of which may vary according to house style.

 Spacing. A comma and one space after a heading before locators? How many spaces

used for indenting subheadings? Are there spaces between alphabetical sections?

 Punctuation. Comma or no comma or some other punctuation between the heading

and the first locator?

 Capitalization. Are the first letters of main headings capitalized or not?

 Highlighting. Is bold type used for important headings or locators?

 Layout. Are subheadings indented or run-in?

 Cross-references. Where are see also cross-references placed?

 Locators. Are they in full or elided form — 317–319 or 317–19?
