Activity A2

Choose a subject with which you are familiar and compare the indexes of several books, paying particular attention to the features listed below. You will need to look closely at each index to try and identify its strengths and weaknesses and how well it serves its intended users.

**Jane Maher: Seeing Language in Sign**

**Van Cleve and Couch: A Place Of Their Own**

**Lentz, Mikos, and Smith: Signing Naturally**

 Introductory statement. Is there one? Is it helpful?

- None have an intro statement

 Multiple indexes. Is there more than one index? Is this helpful for the user of the particular document?

- Only one each

 Term selection. Has the indexer chosen appropriate terms for the document and its users? Have all the indexable elements been included? Is it easy to find the information you expect to be in the document or that you already know to be in the document? Do all the entries lead you to useful information?

- Maher: individual people's names have all locators listed but often without subheadings even when >6 locators. These do seem to be reasonble terms. Columns are very narrow and they seem to be trying to save space hard, these are all wraparound not separately listed 
- Van Cleve and Crouch have a much more readable index, with much more hierarchy, and terms that might otherwise be puzzling as top-level terms ("Canada") sometimes include an explanation "Canada, scheme for a Deaf community in"
- Lentz: often uses titles of exercises, which I guess is important given that they're not in teh TOC

 Main headings and subheadings. Is the index in direct or classified form? Are subheadings used to direct users to various aspects of a topic?

- Direct, all
- Maher: yes
- Van Cleve and Couch: yes, much more effectively as they're on separate lines
- Lentz: yes, but not always effectively. For example "Necklines" is a separate item but not listed under "Clothing"

 Cross-references. Are they used effectively to guide you to preferred terms and related topics?

- Maher: yes
- Van Cleve and Crouch: yes, although sometimes they differ - for example Maher has an ASL entry but they do not
- Lentz: none

This activity should be repeated regularly. As you progress through the course, you will find yourself better able to judge the qualities of published indexes. Asking questions like these will also help you to assess your own work objectively.
