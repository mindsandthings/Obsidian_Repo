Vertical heterophoria diagnosis (June 2021)

Vertical heterophoria is a binocular vision disorder where one eye sees an image slightly higher than the other. To partially compensate, the brain automatically tilts the head to the side to make the images appear level. Chronic head tilt causes headaches, neck pain, and muscle tension. These can be severe and were for me. Other common symptoms include fatigue and anxiety; many people have no visual symptoms.

The treatment is prism lenses to make the images come in at the same "height". After being diagnosed and treated, I stopped having frequent multiday incapacitating headaches. My POTS also improved enough that I was able to stop medications.

My guess is that most of the physical health symptoms I've sought treatment for were directly or indirectly caused the untreated vertical heterophoria. To my surprise, my mental health problems also seem to have been caused by itâ€”after treatment for vertical heterophoria, my sleep and mood improved so much that I was able to discontinue a sleep med, and I'm working with my psych NP to to go off lamotrigine.

I have some residual symptoms, mostly mild everyday headache, that I hope to

Vertical heterophoria can be caused by post-concussive syndrome, or can be congenital but symptoms don't show up until later in life when people stop being able to fully compensate. I asked my optometrist about it and she said it's usually caused by a nerve palsy.

My optometrist is Dr. Morioka of City Optometry in San Francisco.

I have not sought treatment due to the pandemic.

Auditory processing disorder and sound sensitivity

In early 2020, an audiologist diagnosed me with an auditory processing disorder and sound sensitivity that's worse in the same ear as my affected eye.
