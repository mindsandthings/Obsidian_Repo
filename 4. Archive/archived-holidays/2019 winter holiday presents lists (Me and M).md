Black socks
 
Flannel shirts (I like blues and greens), size small or medium
 
A short regular USB-to-USB-C charging cable (like 6 inches)
 
A long regular USB-to-USB-C charging cable (like 6 feet)
 
DVD or USB - there was a late 1990s show called VR.5 that ran for like half a season and may or may not be available anywhere
DVD or USB - some original My Little Pony episodes, from the mid-1980s series, not the recent or 1990s one
 
Headphone adapter for pixel (Michael recommends a 2-pack of these:  [https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PWF5W2M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PWF5W2M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1)  )

A metal fidget ring, size 4.5. Here are a few I've seen that I like:

Thermal insulating curtain or pair of curtains for kitchen: 47" or wider, and 26" height. Solid light color (light gray, light blue, light green, etc). The current ones are clip-on. 
A single-panel thermal insulating curtain for our living room window (i.e., one single curtain that goes all the way across, not two panels): solid-color, light gray or light pale green. 100" wide, ideal length 65-80" but you'll probably only be able to find 84" and that's fine. Attachment type doesn't matter - current one uses little clips and we can attach it to anything, and will probably need to get the curtains shortened anyway.
