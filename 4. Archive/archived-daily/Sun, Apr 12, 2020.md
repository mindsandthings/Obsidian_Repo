Head feels very tight, and neck has been achy for quite a while, including that one part on the right that happens with bass. Very achy in lots of places today, including noticeable nystagmus while laying on my back during exercises. 

Hot shower helped some, as did nerve glides and voltaren on neck. 

10:30am took 1/8th acetazolamide.
