Pain management for today? 

Tired. Head and body are achy, presumably related to yesterday's muldowney upper body, even though it was only 40 seconds on the second level. Disappointing, since on Monday I felt amazing. 

I showered today (still using the ketoconazole shampoo out of concern I may have athlete's foot on my head) and later I'll wash off the back of my head and use DMSO and magnesium oil on it. Maybe I should put a hold on going up on Muldowney uppers until I've finished that and can DMSO much more regularly. 

I do think there's probably some anatomical abnormality that's causing all this. 

I'd also like to do the training and rehabilitation site's exercises, but not until I can DMSO regularly again.
