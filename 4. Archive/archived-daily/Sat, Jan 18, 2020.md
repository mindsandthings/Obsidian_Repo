I shrugged my left shoulder inward and something in my chest went back in. I don't feel all the way great but I feel a lot better. 

Right side still hurts and is out but not as much. 

I tried some nerve flossing and it was helpful; want to try more.

Got period yesterday.

After lunch (cauliflower, pita chips, hummus) the roof of my mouth burned some (hummus?) and first my brain was fuzzy while I tried to work then I got an increasingly bad pressure from inside headache. Took another 1/8 acetazolamide at 1:15pm.
