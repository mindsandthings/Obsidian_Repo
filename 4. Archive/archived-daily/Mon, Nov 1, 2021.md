Jon May is no longer with Well Coast! I wonder what happened. Maybe I can look him up elsewhere? His LinkedIn still shows him at Well Coast. I wonder if he got fired. 

Reading glasses seem ok-ish if I push them way up on my nose and get super close to things. Still may want to contact them. 

Kinda achy today. Found I need to kinda bend over and push top back? almost like I've been leaning too far back above a certain point. 

Went Halloween trickertreating with Maya and others (Athena and Poppy, Jen and Lily and Janine and Mark). Was tired afterward but I did wear my Janet costume without getting a headache even though I itched later where the shirt touched me. 

Now got cramping in abdomen, idk why.
