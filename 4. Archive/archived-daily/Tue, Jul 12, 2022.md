That's the part that hurts: that I was told and told growing up that SFF would be my home and now I feel roundly rejected by it

It turned into normie

but it might not have been that good a fit even then

they did not understand that I did not have \*alternateÂ \*social skills

I cannot be around other unfinished people like me it is too frightening

and puts me in the position of giving, me in the position of fixing, of helping up

but I was never helped in the first place.

It was already normie in college.

I know that.

scared head will always hurt

angry this still happens

angry at teeth

probably they let the fron just stay too close in

trust trust trust fail
