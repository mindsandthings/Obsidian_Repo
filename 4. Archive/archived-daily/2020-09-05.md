Hi, Noe.

Here's a summary of that practice drill we did today.  First, we built a key and chose 4 chords from it.  Those were  D, Em, A, and Bm (a I ii V vi progression in D major).  Then, for exactly two measures each chord, you got to be creative and write a bass line the following ways:

1) "Beginner" (just root notes)

2) "Intermediate" (just root notes and maj or min thirds)

3) "Advanced" (choose a few notes from the maj or min scale)

If the intermediate and advanced ways are still tricky, you can set a metronome and continue to practice them at a slow tempo over the same chords or even just 2 chords at a time.

Let's pick up where we left off next time with "She's Your Cocaine."  This is the live version we were working with: https://open.spotify.com/track/1mTioruEDnKy3mNmfn49pc and here are the chords (though, the live version is 1/2 step lower than this): https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tori-amos/shes-your-cocaine-chords-...

So far, we've just got the Bb and Eb lick.  Remember, it's the root note, then the "pop" picking technique to hammer on to the root note an octave higher.

Thanks, and have a great week.
