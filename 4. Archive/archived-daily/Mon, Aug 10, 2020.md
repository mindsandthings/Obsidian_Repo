Acetazolamide? y, 1/4 at 5:54pm

Clonazepam? n
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? y

Pain management for today? DMSO

DMSO again last night. It does seem to make me able to fall asleep well.

I've been feeling increasingly stuffy-headed yesterday and this morning, despite the DMSO. Head position doesn't seem to make much of a difference. It surprises me that the last time I took acetazolamide was Friday; it feels like it should last longer. (I suppose the last 1/4 was Wednesday, but 1/8 used to work better, I think.)

Also, it's either really hot in here or my temperature sensitivity is messed up again.
