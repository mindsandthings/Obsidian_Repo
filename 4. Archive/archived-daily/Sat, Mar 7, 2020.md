felt very sick yesterday night and i n morning. Last night something cracked upward in hip, I felt much better. MUCH better. As in go to sleep feeling good better. But this morning I felt icky and awful a lot, my neck had gone out. I put it back in but now my right middle finger tip is numb so I must have damaged something.
