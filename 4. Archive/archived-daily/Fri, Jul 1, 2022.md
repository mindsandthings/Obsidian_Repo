Okay, testing this today. My note today. I don't know about tagging. I've been using Bear and I hate the fact that it forces me to see every note's text and not just the title. Super distracting. I think I'm going to count it out based on that.

This might be better than OneNote, even though the tagging is more challenging, since OneNote can't really do tagging flexibly.

At any rate I will try this. It at least has a simple editor. Although OneNote might still be better for most thigns.

Put together porch swing. A slat broke. Didn't see it when I got it out. Am guessing I broke it while putting it together.

Panicked over the person asking about the potassium meter. I don't know if I can lie and say saliva potassium or blood. Don't know what to do. Panicked. Lie and say gardening?

Probably just straight up tell truth? Can they report me to eBay? probably not. Maybe I will just not worry about that too much for now.
