Acetazolamide? y, 1/8th

Clonazepam? n
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? y

Pain management for today?

Tired, brain fuzzy, had dairy yesterday and some stomach cramping now

Took acetazolamide 1:45pm, after a round of DMSO did not help head-tight feeling. May have been brought on by facial muscle Muldowney exercises this morning, or may just have been that it's been 10 days since my last acetazolamide.
