Super anxious all day yesterday. Did research and realized was probably atenolol withdrawal. Apparently 12.5 mg to 0 was too much of a drop for me, even though I didn't notice any differences from 25 to 12.5. Anyway, I'm trying 1/3 of a pill (8.3) for a week instead, and then will try dropping to 1/4 for a week, and then try 0 again. 

Set an upper rib(?) back in this morning and it's wonderful. Still some discomfort in lower back but it's diminished. Lay in bed for half an hour enjoying relaxing, then relaxed on couch, then got breakfast and relaxed with Maya, then started late.
