Pain management for today? 

so tired. Feet started getting dry and itchy last night but mainly dry and painful. They seem fine today. I need to put lotion on them though. 

I still feel headachy and ill and depressed. 

...after listening to 2 frequencies of pink noise in my left ear for ~half an hour, my right thumb has gone numb.
