Went to farm yesterday, met up with Anton and Saumya.

Last night I just wrote stuff up and kind of perseverated I guess. I was very tired and decided not to make myself do anything.

I was going to cut my hair today but I extra-gelled it and proteined it and conditioned it and now it's curled up enough to be short again. 

Yesterday met up with Anton and Saumya and Saumya's family (parents, who will visit again in a month; Anton and Saumya, who live in Melbourne, Florida; and Saumya's brother and wife and their kid Solani?). Saumya has some kind of autoimmune nerve disorder I think? Affecting nerves all over her body. They've got her on immunosuppressants that are working now though, and some kind of treatment that makes her able to walk (she loses feeling in her feet and can't tell where she's walking so she had a walker, but she's supposed to e up and around and wlaking). She's developed an auditory processing disorder in one ear so I told her I'd send her my audiologist info. She asked me about ASL and seemd really interested in it. Has a newfound passion for accessibility for Deaf people too apparently. 

I'm sort of feeling overwhelmed a little but if I can cloister myself in my room and keep going I think I'll get my stuff done.

I'm Elizabeth and I'm going to front today. I'm the one who grew up. I can be graceful and fluid and fluent.
