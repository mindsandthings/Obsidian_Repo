Mid-left-back is out again. Not sure how to put back in. 
Did cat-camel stretches this morning and think it helped though not with that specifically. 

Yesterday evening very stressful because of Erabrand. Am wondering if they did that because when they criticized AutChatMod earlier, I thought they had a good point and changed the language, so now they see me as vulnerable. I know they've written about not experiencing much empathy.
