Tired and achy. Nerve issues(?) across left lower ribcage and beneath it. 

One of my knuckles (middle finger left hand) got bruised yesterday. It doesn't hurt and I don't remember hitting it. It was bruised over the left half. Today it's about 50% better.

Writers workshop yesterday left me very triggered, of the "I'll give you unclear instructions and attribute your inability to follow them to your 'thinking there has to be a right way to do it' psychological issues". I was very blank-expression and trying to lie but not convincingly. I was also trying to be polite and follow rules of politeness while also giving feedback. 

Today in Discord someone was very "meds and psychiatrists are bad and counselors (like me) are good and a threat to their profession!" And it felt super threatening. In that way where someone is just absolutely going to invalidate your trauma.

The world is, of course, falling apart. New estimates for 30%(?) unlivability in 50 years, when I would be 90. Presented as though the people who live there will just stay there, which is the bad part. 

I guess Sunnabeth can actually write, huh.
