Acetazolamide? n

Clonazepam? n
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? y

Pain management for today? nerve glides, de q's

Head already starting to feel stuffy despite feeling opposite yesterday. Was stuffy when I woke up. Disappointing.

Wrists/thumbs especially bad last night after working on shelves. Right hand felt bruised.

Going to try sitting up a lot and see if it helps. 

Thrusting my jaw forward and letting it hang loosely seems to help with drainage
as did a slight massage maybe? putting voltaren gel on the back of my neck.
