I had a really rough day writing-feedback-wise and I think I'm going to have to write an email to some people saying "here are the reasons why I am writing the autistic character the way I am writing her and why I have not implemented the specific solutions you think I should implement, I welcome suggestions for doing that don't involve turning her into someone neurotypical with a more neurotypical backstory and more neurotypical motivations" (but more diplomatic) and they're likely to respond not-awfully but I just really don't want to have to put myself in "here's where I explain myself to non-autistic people and try to explain the magnitude and complexity of what's going on while also keeping the email super-brief" mode

I know Elsa and maybe C.L. are new to the channel since I talked about this: there are a small number of audiologists who do low-gain hearing aids for auditory processing issues. (This gets more relevant in a minute) A friend of mine heard about one who does a free trial for people with auditory processing issues. My auditory fatigue and pain were bad enough that I tried it in hopes it could help.
She also does adjustments that help with sound sensitivity. Afterward, sounds that hurt were the same amount of loudness but somehow didn't hurt. It has been massively helpful, both in terms of pain in response to sounds and in terms of auditory processing. Before I was wearing noise-cancelling headphones even at home, and now I hardly ever wear them.

Since you already have hearing aids you might consider looking into that. I know she has clients with hearing impairment too. It only works with some kinds of hearing aids because of the kind of programming needed.
