Wow, whatever thing inside my neck/top of spine was really, really painfully bad last night. I finally got it to hold still by lying on right side and pressing in/up on neck. Until then no position was comfortable. Moving helped, but then when my muscles relaxed it hurt again. 

I slept badly. Wound up staying in bed until 8:30.
