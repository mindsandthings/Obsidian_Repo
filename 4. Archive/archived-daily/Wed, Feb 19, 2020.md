Very achy; something had gone out in my left mid-low-back. It went back in when I rolled on a ball on it. Now my left trap is achy but when I stretch my chest out and down it helps.

No clonazepam the last couple nights. Had nightmares both nights. 

Slightly panicked over too much to do, hav taken on too much.
