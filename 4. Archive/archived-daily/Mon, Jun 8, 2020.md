Yesterday: drank very little water; salty dinner(?); lay down at night while very tired and then began slowly panicking and being in pain. Got up after midnight, found painful area in underarm, but still felt pretty out of it. Went back to bed. Weird altered state in early morning, lots of daydreaming and weirdness. Eventually took 1/8 acetazolamide and it helped a little. Got very hungry, made food while still feeling extremely bizarrely out of it. Took another 1/8th acetazolamide and after a while began feeling normal instead of dissociated. 

At 4:50pm was feeling squished agin so took a whole 1/4 acetazolamide. may have been salt from pizza
