Pain management for today? head drain position, de quervain's, nerve glides

Woke up feeling circadian rhythm right and feeling pretty good. Head a little swollen on left side but seem  to be able to drain it effectively sitting up straight with jaw relaxed and tongue pressing against entire roof of mouth. 

Are transverse sinuses supposed to drain into back of throat? because I definitely get thick mucus when doing this.
