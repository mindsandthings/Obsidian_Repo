last night julie said our mom's friend texted her and was very worried about mom being at home, sick, no food, hw had trashed the house and not done dishes for a week

julie's upset, I'm depressed. I hat ethis shit, mostly the thing where I can't trust anythign mom says to be a complete picture of the truth and the actual truth is usually worse

sick = contagious? nobody knows but she's definitely sick from asthma from living there

she told her friend apparently that she'd move gram's stuff into storage and then leave hw but I seriously doubt she will, I thinik she was probably just suggesting attending to her life to avoid conflict with her friend

like. she just ignores her life to punish other people
