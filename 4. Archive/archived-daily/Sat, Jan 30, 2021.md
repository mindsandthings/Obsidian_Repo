Went to bed on time? n

Pain management for today? 

Woken up by Michael and kept awake by allergy to sheets, probably to detergent.

Achy and tired and weak. might be a mid back thing? I know I've had it before. Might be mid-lower-left. I've relaxed on the ball which helps and I'm still very tired and drained. 

Should do DMSO again.
