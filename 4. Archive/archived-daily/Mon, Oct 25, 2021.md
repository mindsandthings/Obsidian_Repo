Period again yesterday? Very small. Back and brain feeling better. Back still hurts some though as does neck. If I shut my left eyeing evens out. I hope I'm going to adapt more to my new glasses and that this is temporary because it is the most impairing thing right now, the not comfort bending over. 

A bit worried problem is my eyelashes. Maybe glasses need to be pushed very close? If so, maybe I need to trim my eyelashes?

Feeling guilty and kind of bad and mild triggers. 

Babysat Maya for 3 hours yesterday. Should have just been none but she woke up instead of sleeping and Eric and Allie spent a very long time at the car dealership. 

Major rain yesterday. 

Being on 1/2 atenolol seems to be going 100% fine. I might even feel better and more present, though that may also be less period. 

Elizabeth was wanting us to stay singleted yesterday and I had her stop because I or others were getting uncomfortable. Today she says she does not want to front, not after yesterday. 

Chant may front to help with schoolwork. Ivvy says "too much baby".
