Pain management for today? 

Forgot to take meds last night till 10:30 but was fine. 

This morning right back ribs went up and into place and my back feels much better. Last night the right back side of my head ached and it turned out to be largely due to my right pec; trigger point work helped a lot.

At night I forgot nasalcrom. Was very thick mucus-y in middle of night. Kind of achy/swollen this morning, not awful but right back still feels bluh. Trying trigger points again.
