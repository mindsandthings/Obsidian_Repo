Pain management for today? 

ok today I am doing ok? I woke up yesterday feeling pretty not great, especially top of head. today I have had upper back out and set it back in a couple times. it was doing well for a while, don't know if that was base of skull thing or if what is happening now is from base of skull thing. 

I did a ton of trigger point stuff yesterday though and it does seem to have helped. really need to make time for full trigger point rounds.
