Acetazolamide? y, 1/8th

Clonazepam? y, just needed sleep and forgot meds
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? y

Pain management for today?

achy lower body. bad last night too. maybe from forgetting beer bread? or just lower body exercises new.

back of neck and head feels very tight, but sinceI just had acetazolamide 1/8 2 days ago I want it to last longer. I guess it might not be though.
