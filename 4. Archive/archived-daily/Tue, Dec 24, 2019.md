Worked so late last night. Yesterday had a chiro appointment, chiro is recovering from surgery so his own chiro filled in. He did this hand-vibrating thing for my neck and I think it had some new and different effects. Made the left upper side feel stiff. And good and solid, but that evening it started hurting very badly. 

Worked and worked and worked and finished
don't remember if I took clonazepam. Maybe not?
