Acetazolamide? n

Clonazepam? n
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today? 

Going to start tracking for athletes foot again, sigh. When symptoms disappear, start tracking 2 months.

I've been feeling floppy and inflamed for a couple days now. Assuming it's due to period. Skipping my exercises yesterday and today. 

Going to rehydrate, and if my head itches I'll start applying it there agin. 

In future maybe wear corset and neck brace when start getting floppy?
