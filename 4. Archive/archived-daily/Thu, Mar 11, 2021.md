Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today? 


Went to bed late. Was fine and then started being in more and more pain. Right leg started falling asleep. May have been related to putting neck back in place wrong. It was a pushing in thing. it sucked.

I had to use clonazepam and also like the last 3 nights even though I didn['t put it down. not sure what is up.

today starting very very very slow.
