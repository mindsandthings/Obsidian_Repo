Acetazolamide? n
DMSO? n
Clonazepam? n
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today? 

After two days of being mostly nonfunctional a thing in my lower back clunked while I was lying on my front on the floor and the sense that the right side of my spine was shortened went away along with feeling space and bad physically and mentally. 

Unfortunately my face and back of neck feels like inflammation/tightness again after that and taking Karl on a walk. 

Will try taking DMSO before bed.
