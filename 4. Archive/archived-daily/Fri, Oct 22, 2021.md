Today was exceptionally bad mental zoning out and pain this morning. It seems to have subsided. I got my period earlier this week so it was odd that it was like what happens the 2 days before my period.

What am I doing at night that's causing this? Is it just a long break from wearing glasses? 

Allie asked if I could sit a couple hours for Maya but I also have to get the car with Eric. I don't fucking want to. I didn't know he wanted me to pick it up too; I thought when he said "drop off" he just meant drop off. Now I'm angry at myself for not having thought of it. 

Was mentally yelling at myself I want to die I want to die a lot of yesterday. Very distressed but didn't feel it up front. Wound up taking off writing because tired. But nothing seemed refreshing. Managed to read a book.

But woke up 3 times last night - midnight, 3am, and a little early this morning. Yesterday I felt very much like I do when I get very bad sleep. But I've been at 1/2 on the lyric for over a week now - why would it just start being a problem now? 

Used clonazepam last night because couldn't sleep.
