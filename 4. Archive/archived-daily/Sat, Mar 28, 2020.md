I think bleaching and coloring my hair strand yesterday left me feeling headachy / drainy / hungover. Or possibly that was the bass lesson. Either way, the base of my skull feels achy and congested, and both my hips popped when I knelt and leaned over on the heating pad this morning. 

I've also felt like my ears were congested for a few days.
