Pain management for today? 


woke up briefly at 5am for 3rd day in a row. thought I had felt my watch go off but there lis no alarm set for that time. 

head is itchy/dry and back of neck is scaly and itchy after being almost healed so I think I need to skip DMSO again for a while. (might do nasal rinse again though)
