Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today? 

Wow I woke up feeling floppy and in pain and bad. Back just wrong, too relaxed, out of place all over. I've been going pretty fast at stuff today but maybe I should not relax my back that much? I really need to try changing my sleeping arrangements. 

Turning over seems to make it worse.
