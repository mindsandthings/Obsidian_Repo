Right side of head still achy but not quite as stabby. Sure feel wiped though. Have had to use clonazepam both nights, a full 0.125 the first night  and a half the second. I doubt the half is doing anything but changing my expectations but if I could do it without I would. 

I wish I could figure out what's making that one part of my chest out and put it back in. 

Took 1/8 pill acetazolamide, which helped some though not extremely.
