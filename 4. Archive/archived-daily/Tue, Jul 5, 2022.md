I'm ok. Pushed shoulder a bit and it went in and fixed the awful feeling thing. 

Need to be careful chasing Karl; the stop/start is very hard on the knees. 

Tired and feeling lonely.

Ana used my chicken bits in her burritos and threw out the pasta sauce I made Sat without asking or checking. I'm very disappointed and frustrated. I asked Allie to ask her to stop doing refrigerator management and tell Michael when she uses up ingredients. 

I'm kinda low-key enraged though

\-\-\-\-

Michael got super uncomfortable at the thought of ordering more than one meat dish, or really ordering any dish at all

I don't like it when you override your boundaries and posit it as being reasonable

I feel absolutely exhausted at having dealt with this

In the future, I will order for me. If you want to order a separate order for you, we can pick it up at the same time.
