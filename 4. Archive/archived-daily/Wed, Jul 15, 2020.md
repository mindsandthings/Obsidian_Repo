Acetazolamide? n

Clonazepam? n
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? y

Pain management for today? nerve glides

Realized that I'd only been taking 0.5g of melatonin instead of 1. Took 1 last night. It seems to help even though I went through the same almost-asleep-then-wake-up cycle before falling asleep. 

Huge amounts of physical activity yesterday with cutting and sanding boards. I'm in pain and my back is out somehow again but it's way less than it could have been. 

I am feeling fuzzy-headed and don't want it to be the acetazolamide. 

Could there be something about physical motion causing CSF overproduction? Nothing I can find seems to cover that.
