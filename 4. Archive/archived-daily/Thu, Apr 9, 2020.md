Had clonazepam the last couple nights. Couldn't sleep last night for a long time due to burning shoulder pain under right shoulder blade. Could be passover related, could be the new Muldowney exercises (started uppers level 1 a couple days ago). Woke up feeling pretty crappy, not surprisingly given that I drank a bunch of wine and was also very dehydrated yesterday. The left side of my head feels stuffy today.
