Went to bed on time? y

Clonazepam last night? n

Acetazolamide? n

Pain management for today? nerve glides; attending to hands

Lower right back going back in when I roll from left side onto back is key, but it only works when I'm extremely relaxed.

Last night I found an angle to move my left shoulder at to get that one part that's messed up and it was great. Has relaxed left side of neck some too. Haven't figured out equivalent move for right shoulder, but a little bit, and that helped with the pain after lying down thing.
