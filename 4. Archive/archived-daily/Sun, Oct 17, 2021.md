Eyesight actually seems more blurred than before. I got really tired the last couple days! Hope it clears up soon.

Back feels more better though. 

Had a clear fronting experience last night after thinking about how I don't need to base my decisions of what to do on health so much, about how it's better now to switch between different kinds of tasks instead of just going to ground and zoning out on games.

Dragon in neighborhood (halloween decoration). Maya loves it. I do too.

I saw her shake her head no for the first time today. She also more reliably does yes now. I think she was trying to say pumpkin today. 

We seem to be drifting back to not having meetings / doing system work again, after earlier successes. 

Elizabeth: wants to do everything.
Chant: wants to organize Marvin
Ivvy: wants a break
