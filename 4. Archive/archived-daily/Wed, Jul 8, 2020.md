Acetazolamide? n

Went to bed on time? y

Clonazepam last night? n

Pain management for today? nerve glides


Woke up not feeling as awful as before. Last night I realized that because my right ear is lower my glasses were settling lower on the right side and it was preventing me from being able to hold my head level comfortably. Pushing them upward on the right side seems to have helped.

Managed to get into shower at 7:30, largely because I knew maintenance guys were coming at 9. 

Having a very difficulty time with some exercises again - TYI and also the band exercises where I seem to be permanently stuck on yellow despite being technically 3 layers up. Wrist ones are almost all fine. 

I think I need to drop *way* back, I just don't want to. Or maybe I need to go up further and see if strength at a higher level enables endurance at a lower one.
