Yesterday went to Maya vaccination party then was tired all day. Stomach hurt. I think lowering my famotidine is bad, actually. I took it back up to 10mg and I took ibuprofen and am finaly feeling a little better.

feel exhausted though, and eyes are not working right. especially in the distance but also everything feels/looks unreal unless i tilt my head back and look down.

Sat decided no Isaac till Sep 18.

1\. EBT: 5 (back). I'm really upset.

Head is off, eyes are off, went for a walk and was fine but back inside stomach hurt. Changed to new aligner yesterday. Want someone to be compassionate and notice the eye-jaw-head-neck problems.

Ultra atired. NEed to go to be actually early tonight.

3:45pm: I think I'm having CSF pressure from the allergy thing on Saturday and from the changed aligner, or possibly from my period being over. Having some dandelion leaf tea shortyly. Maybe that is behind all the Isaac stuff and reading and getting stuck? Feels like my right ear is draining/leaking but not enough. letting the tea cool now.

Yesterday had some tea and it helped. This morning the part of my head that had slid out finally went back in, after lying in bed and relaxing. I spent an extra hour and a half in bed and do not regret it.

I reread The Goblin Emperor, and it is just so stunningly good, with character development. It felt like wish fulfillment, a bit, when I read it first, kind of imposing modernity onto other cultures, but it really is well done.

I do still feel that my head is tight, at the very back. Swelling up again. Should I try the tea? I will.

I think my vision is returning to what it was before, though my headaches are not as bad. he issue now is just more and more, I am not seeing things outside my head.
