Acetazolamide? n

Clonazepam? n
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? y, but awake very late

Pain management for today?

Could not sleep last night due to head pain. Left sinus. Did not feel tight in rest of head, felt fine when I lay down but when I lay my head back all of a sudden sinus, like I popped something and it drained into the wrong place. It's still a bit painful this morning.

I put some DMSO on the back of my neck and temples and my head doesn't feel full but it does feel kind of burned/ouchy and I'm very tired. 

Wonder if there's something I keep poking that then starts stuff draining wrong.
