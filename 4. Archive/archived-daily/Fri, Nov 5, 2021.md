5:45pm at dentist last night heart was pounding, though I was also dehydrated. 

Last night Celeste said to Allie: "nobody takes me seriously, but Maya never cries with me" (as in: she believes that she can put Maya to bed and change her diaper without Maya crying, even when Maya cries with other people). Allie didn't say anything to precipitate this, Maya was just crying in her bedroom while Eric and Anna tried to put her to sleep. Allie asked if she was saying she wanted to be responsible for Maya more often, and said that nothing was stopping her. (I had actually assumed Celeste wasn't being left alone with Maya because she's having memory problems and because she's grieving.) It was passive-aggressive of Celeste, and in line with how I've seen her communicate in some other situations. I didn't like it and I think Allie responded pretty well, although I do think there was an implicit assumption that Celeste wouldn't/shouldn't be left responsible for Maya. 

Doing pretty well today. Got aligner changed. Drove with prisms for first time yesterday and they were great. Orthodonist says tooth is not coming down and we will need to do refinement but she also sped up the schedule, which is great. 

Bass looks like it's going to get more complicated which will make it interesting and easier.

Had to reschedule Dr. Rae because of mowers.
