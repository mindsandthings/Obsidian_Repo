Feeling a little better. Took 10 mg famotidine in case stomach cramping is worsening things. Used voltearen gel on lower back last night and this morning. I sure do wish it would go back into place, if that's the problem. 

Being more on track than usual with Marvin time blocking. It seems to help. 

My visual focus seems a little better too.
