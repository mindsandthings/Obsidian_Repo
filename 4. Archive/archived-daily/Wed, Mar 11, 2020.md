Took 1/8 tablet diamox last night due to severe head pain/pressure. Was awake/jittery most of night it felt like. 

Today feels like reverse pressure, though only after it felt like my head drained into my sinus. I still feel painful and fuzzyheaded so I'm not sure what's going on. I'm not going to try more though. 

Think I also got very dehydrated yesterday, not good.
