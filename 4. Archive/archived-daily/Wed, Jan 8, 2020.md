Last night hard time sleeping, had to finally take 0.125 clon and still hard time. Think it was very high upper back that got painful. Going to try propping up pillow to see if helps, and also stretch arms differently.

Katie goes home today; her last night was here; thank goodness things are regular again. I'm still doing a lot of to-do's but I'm going to write too.
