Went to bed on time? y

Clonazepam last night? n

Pain management for today? nerve glides

This morning pushed upward on my left ribs and they felt much better than they have in a long time. I've still been fatigued and super-wiped this morning, though. I might have gotten dehydrated yesterday. It's been 5 days since I had 1/4 acetazolamide and I'm not sure if I should try having some again but maybe? I think it took me a while to fall asleep and I woke up in the middle of the night. 

Definitely my left sinus feels bulgy and achy. 

going to try taking an acetazolamide 1/8 and see if it helps with this blank staring at wall cannot do anything thing. 

11:55am: sure did help. feeling much clearer-headed and have a ton more initiative.
