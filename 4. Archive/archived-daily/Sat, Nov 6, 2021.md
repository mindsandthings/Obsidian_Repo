Right top rib feels out again, though in general I'm doing well.

Feeling a little overcharged.

Considering / making a daemon/tulpa aka splitting my conscious into two parts, one that does and one the provides feedback and that I respect and listen to. 

This is probably a good idea. 

Sky posted stuff re the server-wide incident with Nightshades and wow they are fucking narcissistic. 

I think my vision has finally adjusted to my close-up glasses!!
