Nose ran and sneezed a bunch this morning, then felt very lightheaded when standing (and continue to feel that way) and had chest pain and heart thumping after going up stairs. Suspect this is due to starting the Muldowney prep exercises for uppers yesterday. May also be dehydration. Going to try and see.
