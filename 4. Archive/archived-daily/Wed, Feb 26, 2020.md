Had a serious problem in lower mid-back that fuzzed up my head. Did not realize till this morning when it went in.

Took a full .125 clonazepam last night because I thought it was due to sleeping poorly. DOn't know if it was or not. Did sleep poorly due to being up late playing games. past red light.
