New glasses here! The distance ones. It is SO MUCH EASIER to see the computer screen - so much less shadowing. It makes me think something is wrong with the other ones. 

Babysat Maya today. Crashed after...but then with new glasses suddenly I'm mentally coordinated and full of energy. 

I do think I had an allergic response to the food last night. Felt sick standing up an hour and a half after dinner, dry feet and hands.
