Went to bed on time? y

Pain management for today? 

Hip hurts very badly. Right hip, around the top of the leg. Feels like a tendon thing; a deep burning. Worsened when I move. I took 3 ibuprofen and put some voltaren gel on it and I can still feel it. 

Right back of neck very painful yesterday, related to something in low mid-back (ribs esp right side). The rib went back in briefly this morning and was fine and then went out again. 

Holding my craniofacial muscles up does seem to help some. 

Found "meralgia paresthetica"  and that seems to be the hip issue.
