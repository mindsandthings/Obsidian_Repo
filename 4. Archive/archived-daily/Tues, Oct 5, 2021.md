Just another Tuesday
Slept well; breathing in helps ribcage + trps on face and neck last night means yesterday and today are pretty good healthwise. 

I did play too much Slay the Spire yesterday, but the day also went well (partly because of canceled class - instructor stuck near death valley). In the evening I was tired and also didn't ahve enough stuff to do / that I wanted to do, and I was also having dopamine cravings I guess? But I waited and it passed. 

I realized I can just ask Celeste how I can support her.
