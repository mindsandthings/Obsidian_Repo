Acetazolamide? n

Went to bed on time? y but did not sleep

Clonazepam last night? y

Pain management for today? nerve glides

Really hard time falling asleep due to upper-chest-area spine pain, even though I'd fixed the thing on the left side and thought that would take care of it (and even after I took clonazepam). Something about the angle of the pillow and head, maybe? I wish I could figure it out. Maybe I will try lying on my back tonight.
