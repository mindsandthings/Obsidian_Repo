Have recently been relaxing in bed in the mornings/nights, and then expanding rib cage by breathing in deeply, which pops ribs back into place. I guess they were popped in, maybe from my trying to set them (and the rotating was to get them to pop back out on that side). Am hoping that will heal/go out less after glasses.
Neck and head feeling tight, probably from chewies for aligners.
Hot in here. Hoping today is the last really hot day. A bit worried Allie will buy a non-AC house; I just don't think I can handle that with the number of nights it would be above 74.
