Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today? 


Super thirsty last night. Have been dehydrated a whole lot. Feet ouchy today (the stepping on feeling like bruised thing, not the itchy)

Also today feet started doing the cold / dry / painful thing they were doing just before and for a couple days after I began treatment this time. Socks did feel a little wet when I was done showering this morning. Maybe it could have caused an outbreak? idk why it even happens at all.
