Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today? 


Woke up middle of night, feet and hands dry and hot. Assuming it's an athletes foot thing. It didn't happen last night; maybe from shower bottom? I'll need to find my shower shoes and figure out how to clean it out. 

Although that one part of my neck was in for a few days, it went out again after I was bent over for a bit on the couch. It may have been gradually going out but it was definitely out after that. 

I did get it a little bit fixed later on. And I admit that having it slightly out seems to allow it to drain better. 

I think it might be that my spine needs to slide forward under my skull to prop it up? But I could be wrong.
