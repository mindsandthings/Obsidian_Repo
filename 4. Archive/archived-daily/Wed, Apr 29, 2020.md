Had 1/2 clonazepam last night. Seemed like melatonin hit too early, and I was sleepy around 10 but not by 10:45. 

I think it hits faster on an empty stomach, but I'm not sure. 

Started new level of upper body today. 2 exercises - the Y of TYI and the external rotations with yellow band - are just not possible for me to do all the way through. I may have overdone it.

Also my head/neck feels kind of achy.
