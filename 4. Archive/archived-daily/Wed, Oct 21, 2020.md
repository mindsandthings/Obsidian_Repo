Acetazolamide? took another 1/8 at 6:09pm

Clonazepam? n
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? y

Pain management for today?


I took minimal acetazolamide since Sep. I think maybe that's when I let up on exercising? I did need it a couple times but only 1/8th. So it seems likely that something inflammatory is causing the back of my neck to swell up and block CSF and maybe venous outflow. Or maybe it's related to the TOS stuff (I bought the book on Sep 25, and needed some acetazolamide on the 28th and 29th, but then no again until Oct 9 and it didn't help then). 


By 12pm, despite DMSO, head very tight esp behind eyes.
