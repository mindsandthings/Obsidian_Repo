Acetazolamide? n

Clonazepam? y
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today?

last night was almost unbelievably painful after a while while trying to sleep. I set some stuff back into place and there was one moment where it was ok, but then I moved and it stopped being ok. 

I think it may have been related to doing the Muldowney matrix exercise for the first time yesterday. Am also wondering if some of the ongoing issues were related to the standing superman one. I've stopped doing those.
I"m going to try to start the upper body ones again in conjunction with the TOS exercises, since I think I am losing strength there.
