(prev night)

Went to bed on time? y

Pain management for today? 

Last night after got into bed started feeling allergies. Wash sheets again without the bleach stuff? 

Want to make a pillow for upper arm but not sure about space in bed. Or if have pillows, or allergy sheets. (Probably have an allergy pillowcase in my travel stuff.)

A bit achy today. Stretching still seems helpful.
