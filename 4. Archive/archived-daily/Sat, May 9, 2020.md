Played games most of day. Have now vowed not to play (any) games again until June unless it is a non-addictive game with Michael. 

Very uncomfortable after lying at computer a long time. Some nerve stuff helped. Also this morning did extra new exercise with weights and I think that worsened it. 

Refill meds
Eggs honey etc
Sheet pan dinner
Update Arsenic chat times in calendar
Clean kitchen / wash dishes
Freeze flax gel
20 min bass practice

Check IUD strings
Wash stockings
Shower
