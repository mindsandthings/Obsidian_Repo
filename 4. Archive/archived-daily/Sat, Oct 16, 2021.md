Lyrica still at 1/2. Going to do for a few more day and then cut to 1/4. I'll retain the other remaining ones for a bit. 

Did some trigger points last night and helped. Ongoing relaxation may have slowed down thought it's still going. I want to keep working so it doesn't level off. Part of that is Muldowney protocol uppers once I've reached full benefits (planning to start next week though I remember full benefits take several weeks so may want to wait). Part of that is trigger points. Part of that is stretches. Part of that is work ergonomics. 

Anniversary was a bit stressful early on due to fight over whether Bronco Billy's pizza slices were the same as small pizzas. We were both right about parts of it and wrong about parts of it but it was still upsetting. Vegan cake was ok but too sweet. 

**Clonazepam** last night. Was too hot in bed at 74 degrees; should have opened window earlier. Also suspect I should not have gone for that extra hour of sleep yesterday morning despite waking up early. 

Feeling a little stressed about discussion question + studying today but I think they will be fine. Mostly worried I'll put it off and then not do it. 


Elizabeth (Sunnabeth, Unicorn): I'm here. Will watch out for where I can join in, and join.

Chant: I'm here for studying.

Ivvy: not today
