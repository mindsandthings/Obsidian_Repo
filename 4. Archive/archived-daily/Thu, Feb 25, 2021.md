Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today? 


Went for walks several times the last couple days and lowest back is now in a lot of pain.

Feet have been feeling dry/itchy at night. Might have white streaks on them. Not ready to start the stuff again yet though. 

Took some ibuprofen 9:25am. May be period cramps. 

Offered purple (amethyst) hair dye to Ana. She did not want it.But she wasnâ€™t like Aimee. Ad hoc improvisation worked for Aimee, who could spontaneously rush into danger and defeat it with nothing but daggers and enthusiasm, but not for her. She needed to go in with supplies and a plan.
