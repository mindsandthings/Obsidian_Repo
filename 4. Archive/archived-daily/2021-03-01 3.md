An important thing I am learning is to remember to ask myself **“Is there a better target for my anger?”**
* Anger is a valid emotion; we have the right to feel angry. The world is unjust, there are many reasons to be angry
* But so much of media & culture (especial online) is about **manipulating our anger**, and **re-directing it at the wrong targets**
* Our anger is treated as a commodity, to be controlled & exploited by the powers that be
* So they have built a culture where **we are not taught to examine** **our anger or****where we direct it**
* On a mass scale, this allows leaders to start false **wars** & **manipulate elections**
* On a more personal level, progressive spaces are torn apart by in-fighting, by the double-edged sword **purity and harassment culture**
* If anger is a sword, we were not taught to handle it safely, without cutting off our own fingers.
* Our enemies divided us, handed us weapons, pointed us at each other, and stood back to enjoy the carnage.
Be angry. But be*wise*. Pay attention to where you are pointing your sword. **Pay attention to who ends up bleeding–and whether they are****actually****your enemy.**
