Acetazolamide? 1/6 at night

Clonazepam?
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today?

Wound up with a lot of pain in afternoon and evening left side of head. (Mid-back had shifted down and left, set it back into place early Tues am.) Took acetazolamide for that an dit helped some. Also took ibuprofen before going to bed and in the morning, and DMSO twice during the day.
