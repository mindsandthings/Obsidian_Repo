Feeling pretty stressed. Last night Eric said the neighbors were out of town and their bins had been out all week and we could put our excess recycling in their bin. He was wrong. They threw it all over our lawn this morning. They were frightening and inappropriate, and I am angry at him, and angry at myself for having lost touch with my initial skepticism that it was okay to do that, back when he advocated for it at our house.

I wrote an apology and he will hand write it out and put it on their bin.

Tried to read Jung's Red Book. Am utterly baffled that anyone could derive meaning from this, or even follow it. Checked out a later work of his that I hoped would be clearer and it's about the same. Constantly uses words in unfamiliar ways; never clarifies, which means the actual meaning of the words is constantly interfering with whatever he's using them to mean. Also, genderedness, urgh.
