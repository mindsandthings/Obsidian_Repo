Worried about various things, including my weird lack of energy this week—maybe it was due to too much CSF and then too little, but it was still weird. And just in general worried about feeling confused and disoriented on job plans.

I have more Nasalcrom again and should take care not to run out.

I may have had butter in Ana's food last night. Took extra famotidine and ibuprofen before bed.

Stayed up too late again and am frustrated with it, since I think poor sleep is heavily contributing.

1\. EBT: 3; did a tool

2\. EBT: 4; no tool

3\. EBT: 3; no tool

4\. EBT: 5; no tool

I want to make sure we do EBT but back says no.

I did feel pretty normal this morning for the first tiem in a while, maybe from doing nasal crom 2x/day. Or maybe from chatting with millie and sky last night. Or maybe just from gradual recovery from whatever awful thing I did to my vision early in the week. Also help sprobably that it was a good political news week, for once: talk of treason with Trump, and the Inflation Reduction Act passing (even though it had some of the essential parts taken out).

extremely angry about dentist

# Tue, Aug 16, 2022

dentist, whatever

need to get help with glasses, brain not working right I don't thin.

Something definitely happened last week, and it disrupted everything. Maybe the damaging of that part of my right eye, getting the nerve caught? would very much like someone to pay attention to what is physicaly going on with the bones and fluid in my head

S went on a twitter rant: 

https://twitter.com/sqiouyilu/status/1560229177915166720?s=20&t=uooZFWPWwKwzix8tlHGK9g 

I posted this to the PubQ S channel:

A big chunk of S's thread follows the topics and structure of my (much more positive) 2016 blog post on Clarion West and accessibility, but reframing everything I covered in the most negative and personal way possible.[10:59](https://pubq.slack.com/archives/C3MHNDR6U/p1661018388743179)SL Huang linked to that post in a twitter thread the day before and I'm guessing S reread it and live tweeted a rant.[11:02](https://pubq.slack.com/archives/C3MHNDR6U/p1661018530974079)It's an older post and does not cover the new location or new workshop structure, but I'm going to repost it here since my focus was on accurately portraying accessibility-relevant features of CW at the time it was written (edit: and I think S's thread mixes stuff that happened and stuff that didn't in a very misleading way): https://elizabethbartmess.com/deciding-whether-to-attend-clarion-west-for-disabled-writers/ (edited) [11:02](https://pubq.slack.com/archives/C3MHNDR6U/p1661018547910839)(Admittedly, the part about our class not having much drama didn't age as well as I wish it had)[11:02](https://pubq.slack.com/archives/C3MHNDR6U/p1661018561917969)I need to update the link to the CW faq in that post. Here's the updated link: https://www.clarionwest.org/programs/summerworkshop/faq/

thing is, in the latter part of S's thread they correctly identified that the diversity committee focused exclusively on BIPOC issues. they got that from the actual committee's blog post. 

also in SL Huang's tweet thread they noted that they had to cut accessibility stuff. here's their private pubq post to the businessy_tw-publishing channel mentioning that: [SL Huang is only sometimes here](https://app.slack.com/team/U1L7X412Q) [3 days ago](https://pubq.slack.com/archives/CP70CDG68/p1660755013423689?thread_ts=1660754409.365039&cid=CP70CDG68)
I want to add in particular bc of the trend of the conversation here -- I had to cut SO MUCH, so if there's something you're disappointed not to see, I'm sorry! (the first draft I turned in was twice this length) I wanted to make mention of that bc much of the in-channel conversation here was about accessibility, which initially I did a whole page on but my editor and I agreed that since it wasn't the article's focus I wasn't doing it justice in the "this really needs its own article" sense ![:disappointed:](../../_resources/e576527373e598afb7fb6bb6a9d72fe7) ![:sweat:](../../_resources/c2551ab4de993767099eabb4f3469a3d) It's such an important issue and I wish I had been able to do it justice and I'm sorry I wasn't, and I deeply appreciate everything people shared with me on that.

\-\-\-

It's simultaneously validating and distressing to see that actually confirmed. I have avoided mentioning that part of the thread at all. but if I did my comment would be "S isn't making a real challenge or trying to get broader engagement; if they were, they wouldn't have said 'CW is doing just fine with race but fucking up disability', because no one cares about disability. 

I'm thinking about what to say if someone asks me about it but the thing is...I doubt anyone will ask me about it, or even think it's worthy of mention that S is right. So thanks, S; you've ensure that people are now even less likely to bring that up. 

I hope it will all come out someday and people will be sympathetic but I can't imagine that happening any time soon. and people will hate me for it. 

Wish I could bring up the Clarion West slack channels on identity getting deleted except for the alumni and the BIPOC ones. Wish I could mention my theory that the Suzanna Palumbo/Dave Ring-driven horrible PubQ policy idea happened around the same time and that there must have been some actual fucking coordination in some other fucking slack. 

Like, there must have been even more stuff going on other places that I didn't hear about. And I just really hope some of it will come out someday.
