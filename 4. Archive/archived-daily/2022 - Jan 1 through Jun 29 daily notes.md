This is our daily check-in. The purpose is to try to keep channels open in preparation for working out future concerns. We're not going to go in-depth right now, we're just going to say hi.

How we are doing physically and emotionally: head tight, lower back achy, some abdominal cramping. We did get up early, but we don't recommend full tilt ahead because of not wanting to make things worse. Currently we're wearing an eyepatch for half an hour to see if it has lasting effects. Moving my arms is also doing the thing. Probably because of the aligner. May be because of PMS; will take some ibuprofen. Getting chills every time we move our arms.

Took 3 ibuprofen 8:30.

Consciousness: ugh, I'm tired.

Fronter(s)?: we're worried we may not actually exist

‚Ä¢ üß•Megynn (she/her) - check-in and talk to me. I'm doing good. I'm tired.

‚Ä¢ üå≥ Gaia (she/her)- ask later if I want to be called to front - I'm all right.

‚Ä¢ üß∂Jamie (they/them) - check-in, talk to me, call me to front

‚Ä¢ Penswer - \[fronted for lunch today\]

‚Ä¢ üë©üèª‚ÄçüîßIvvy (she/they) - check-ins, talk with, evoke self- I'm good

‚Ä¢ The Fear / Frightened - scared of permanently breaking reality / going crazy and being unable to return, everything devolves into terrifying chaos - \[sees self in mirror, that's me\] \[what would you want to do to give up your job?\] I don‚Äôt' know what I'd want to do. \[do you want to check in?\] no, maybe later.

‚Ä¢ Invite any new parts; offer to add them to the queue with the stipulation that is is long

Remember that the others are doing a trial run standing up for the one in front and the one in front is doing a trial run not singleting

Yesterday messaged Zelle (person looking for accountability buddy) and we are going to try Wed-Thu-Fri morning pomodoros.

Talked with Eric and Allie re our moving out. We discussed various potential things that could happen that might influence our staying here.

Ana is back today. Loud this morning but quiet during Maya's nap.

Mid- and low back feel like they're burning. Going to take 3 ibuprofen. 4 is more effective but am worried it was screwing up my stomach last time. 7 days till p\[eriod.

Have first signonconnect (Deaf ambassador) chat today at 1:20. \[they did not show\]

Reddit folks gave us some unhelpful advice including suggesting our chronic illness was somatized. We overresponded to the person suggesting autism was dissociated emotions. Attempted to stand up for the one in front including diplomatic responses although it took a lot of time and we have reservations about that.

How we are doing physically and emotionally: physical pain mid and low back, back of head feeling tight and airless. Emotionally I can infer how I'm doing from circumstances but I'm not sure I'm feeling anything. \[crossing legs for a while helped, as did pressing a spot on neck Megynn found\]

Consciousness: hurt (we took some ibuprofen and we're hoping that makes it better) thank you

Fronter(s)?: not really here right now

‚Ä¢ üß•Megynn (she/her) - check-in and talk to me: (we can often hear your tone of voice but we can't hear the words. If you want, we can talk to you anyway.) yeah that's fine. \[we chat\] (Is there anything you want?) yes I'd like you to pay attention to me

‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢ Penswer: nothing today

‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢ üë©üèª‚ÄçüîßIvvy (she/they) - check-ins, talk with, evoke self: I'm fine. Talk to me. (we ask if the person that comes to front that feels like her is her. She says no. We ask if the back people are the same ones as the ones that front. She says kind of.) \[A part interferes and we start perseverating on talking to the doctor. We think it's to block us from talking to Ivvy because we're scared of hurting her. Someone says that won't happen. \[speculation that our chronic fear of hurting other people is displaced from having to worry about hurting our mom? And/or her being unhappy that we weren't taking others' needs into account more. Someone says "yeah, that's it." \] (We're not going to let others blame us for having our own needs. We will stand up for our own needs. Ivvy can stand up for her own needs.) Yess!! I would like the desk.

Woke up with increasingly bad headache left upper neck. After a lot of work discovered it seems to need nerve glides right lower below ribs, although I don't know if all the stuff I did prior to that was necessary or not. Took ibuprofen again last night, thought not more than minor discomfort today yet.

Starting with Zelle tomorrow.

Gradual headache yesterday slowly got worse, despite improving a several times in response to adjustment. May have been triggered by exercise and/or reading glasses. Will stop doing exercise. Worried adjustments aren't hitting the root problem and are just htiting the compensatory reaction and causing it to be worse.

Started pomodoros with Zelle but she disappeared after the first one and it sounds like she will not be reliable after all.

Outlined yesterday but could not bring self to write.

How we are doing physically and emotionally: physically pretty bad; headache more severe than in a while, and although it's not at peak pain, something is stuck that's not letting up. Very unpleasantly painful. And very frustrating. I feel like everything is burning. Emotinoally I' not doing much, just kind of absent and getting through.

Headache mostly going away after pressing on right side (actual side) of ehad while lying on right side and a thing in the center middle of neck clunked. Yesterday really just read tumblr / played games.

Today trying to get back into gear. Zelle msgd me to get day started (kinda late) which is good.

Check-in

This is our daily check-in. The purpose is to try to keep channels open in preparation for working out future concerns. We're not going in-depth right now, just saying hi.

How we are doing physically and emotionally: absolutely raging over the idea that identifying a negative pattern of behavior as narcissistic is ableist. I'm just. Furious. It's a server with a high proportion of abuse victims, ffs. It's like watching ugly dangerous inroads made into safe spaces. That result in suppressing verbalization of negative things about abusers. And mean I have to be super careful describing anything and constantly test the waters. And wait for the backlash. I don't think I‚Äôm protecting myself at all. Protecting is not getting into the situation. Because once in the situation it's unethical not to speak out. But also. Passive aggressive speaking out because not willing to argue it.

It's like everything spun around. It went through a brief period of being okay to talk about abuse (accepting abuse victims) to not being okay to talk about abuse (accepting everybody). I think I'm going to bail on plural servers and I'm going to have to bail on neurodiversity since the sociopaths are infiltrating neurodiversity.

Physically: still having a headache, not 100% out of the woods yet, but much better. Tired and want to sleep.

I've re-tilted our glasses, which seems to enable our head to be straight even though we'd way rather not have them tilted

Mentally: feeling depressed over therapy. I really need some attention to the emotional reactivity thing, and some acknowledgment that it's genuinely a primary problem that has a great deal to do with why social spaces are unsafe for me.

We are having a shit ton of problems with parts work pressuring us into unsafety

And we are just intensely triggered, and the problem with being triggered is that it creates serious safety issues on its own. It spirals. It's not something I can stop by deciding I'm being unrealistic.

We're really trapped by therapy aproaches to things that rely on our Just Doing It, without acknowledgment of the side effects of Just Doing It

o Consciousness: better now that you wrote that

o

o Fronter(s)?: I feel like shit

o

o üß•Megynn (she/her) - check-in and talk to me: go away

o

o üå≥ Gaia (she/her)- checkin and front: go away

o

o üß∂Jamie (she/her) - check-in, talk to me, call me to front: talk to me. \[advises us we're okay as we are. Says we made her to be helpful, but she likes it\]

o

o Penswer: I want you to relax. \[I don't know how to relax - this is the part of us that clamps down very hard when therapy tries to force us into unsafety and when we continually put ourselves into triggering situations instead of abandoning them.\] well just do it. \[yes, but it isn't a thing we know how to do.\] \[we've persistently had to reorient others to the importance of outcomes over compassion for reasons, and it makes sense we'd have to do it with ourselves - having people focus on our immediate emotions rather than the things the emotions are signaling is super dangerous. External problems don't disappear with self-compassion, and self-compassion removes the friction we need to actually exit those situations, \*because we're not allowed to exit the situations early on.\*\] \[We discuss and decide to leave the server.\]

o \[we bail. General consensus is that was a good decision and that we stood up to protect ourselves. We're conflicted on our goodbye message, since it exposes us, but we didn't want to just leave without calling out the insanity for any onlookers. When we focus on the onlookers' relief, it seems a little easier. We commit to ignoring any friend requests or DMs from folks in that server. We do have a part that is really frightened over it and feels very exposed and in danger but we'll remind it that this is our alt account, and if it gets triggered we will take over and protect it if it will hand us the reins.\]

o

o üë©üèª‚ÄçüîßIvvy (she/they) - check-ins, talk with, evoke self: I don't like you. (voice doesn't sound like Ivvy but we confirm)

o \[maybe we should abandon the "past self" model of our plurality\] \[conflict on that\]

o \[I really resent having spaces that I could be a fairly good person in (liberal tolerant spaces) turn into ones that are actively hostile\]

o \[internal arguing over whether they're hostile or whether I'm blowing them out of proprotion\]

o \[I realy, rally hate people who brush that stuff off like it doesn't have meaning\]

Right eye/head/side bothering me. Eyes always seem to feel tight after close-up work. I will try the distance glasses plus the reading glasses again.

Going to look at 4221 San Juan Avenue today.

Played Slay the Spire yesterday and regret it a little.

Last night Michael and I discussed acknowleding (basically) that w don't have a romantic or sexual relationship right now. I suggested calling ourselves life collaborators. This feels like a huge relief to me, and headmates seemed relieved and more open too.

I patched right eye for a while and that seemed to help a lot.

Yesterday talked with Eric and Allie about idea that we move with them but dcide to move out later, or that we get a 1 bedroom in the area but rent a bedroom as an office. We wound up brainstorming and deciding that Allie would approach Celeste about Bob moving into her condo and some of the condo being used as office space.

Gentle massages ovre skin where the trigger points are seemed to help.

Headache today. Right side. May be trigered by tension from jaw plus forearms from phone plus eyes from phone. Phone bad. Hurts head. Try stopping. But, possibly also doing craniofacial exercises from Muldowney.

Went to see house to possibly buy yesterdya. But, no AC. Not like that.

Later, lying on right side hand on head, a bit on my skull by my right ear separated slightly and I feel much better. Right eye still feels bad though.

‚Ä¢ Physically: headache. Not so bad we can't work but it is definitely impacting us and we need to keep an eye on it. It might be going away, but it might not be.

‚Ä¢ Emotionally: Feeling a little better than yesterday. I think I've been kind of depressed and understimulated. Maybe getting out of the house helped. Even though it may have contributed to the headache.

Smoke alarm in Maya's room went off last night - low battery, but changing it didn't seem to fix it for long. Will try blowing out dust. Want to write up description for slack.

Right lower rib went back in last night after I'd done trigger points on upper ribs and then was working on the lower one at the end where it hurt - I poked it and it did a tiny pop and shift and then everything on that side and some things on the other side loosened up. I thought that maybe it was where the front and back bones close together but it's not far enough to the front. It might be one of the floating ribs.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth\_rib\_syndrome

That seems pretty plausible. Or maybe multiple ribs since it also looks like thos emight go together sometimes.

After putting it back up (it went out against this morning but I pushed it upward and it helped) I'm experiencing more pain on the left side.

The right base of my skull has calmed down some; unclear if that was related to this. My head feels tilted to the left.

Yesterday realized it was our right lower rib getting out of place. We've set it back in at least a bit and it's comfier. Jaw is still clenched though. Probably need to start TMJ exercises, especially because it's giving us a persistent right side headache.

Journal

Yesterday head/neck finally began feeling ok again. Last night started getting abdominal cramps; think I'm about to get my period (a bit later than expected). Makes me wonder if the last few days of head pain/neck pain was actually period-related.

Housecleaners coming today.

Took Maya out to watch garbage trucks this morning. Wrapped my robe around her so she wouldn‚Äôt' be cold.

Major difficulty sleeping last night. Took clonazepam but it didn't help much. Also took ibuprofen 4, not sure when. Need to go back to reading before bed. Got some books.

Floating(?) ribs continuing to bother me.

Check-in

This is our daily check-in. The purpose is to try to keep channels open in preparation for working out future concerns. We're not going in-depth right now, just saying hi.

Remember the others are doing a trial run standing up for the one in front and the one in front is doing a trial run not singleting

How we are doing physically and emotionally:

o Physically: took ibuprofen and used voltaren gel on sides and back. It really seems to help. Plus our right side of head headache left, although the left seems to be starting. \[Did some TOS trigger points for left side; seems to help some.\] Had some caffine, making me feel high energy.

o Emotionally: Feel excited but that may be the diet coke? Feel a little guilty that I may have been hard on the therapist yesterday. Glad we're more in touch again now that novel is finished.

o Consciousness: tired.

o The body: hungry, ouchy. \[break for snack\]

o

o Fronter(s)?: just kinda absent

o

o üß•Megynn (she/her) - check-in and talk to me: I'm excited, I'm enthusiastic, I'm ready to go!

o

o üå≥ Gaia (she/her)- checkin and front: I think you should rest more. You're not resting enough. (rest and do what?) read. Explore. Tarot, of course. Setting intentions and making plans and invoking. Use crystals and invoke other states of being.

o

o üß∂Jamie (she/her) - check-in, talk to me, call me to front:

o In my cottage by the sea. I can hear the waves crash against the cliff. It's a white cottage. Grey sky. (Is Irish)

o Idea that Jamie is a selkie. She likes that. The sealskin goes by the door, or maybe a chest.

o (Do you want to work on the inside?) Later.

o

o Penswer - check-in, call to front:

o Stressed

o (Would it be okay if we got to know you some?) No. Just relax.

o

o Noemi√© \[The Fear / Frightened\] - scared of permanently breaking reality / going crazy and being unable to return, everything devolves into terrifying chaos

o Doesn't know where she is \[the library we were trying to do\]

o (Would it help if you had a body?) Yes.

o A gangly kid, sandy brown hair

o Wants a kids' library

o The West Knoxville Branch library

o

o Invite any new parts; offer to add them to the queue with the stipulation that is is long:

o The Dark. Male voice, comforting. I help you relax.

o

o Talk with Megynn, Jamie, Jackson:

o Jamie: wants to do up cabin modern. Now it's modern, high glass front, wood, back peak to high glass wood, kitchen. Fridge.

o Jackson: \[visits her there, with permission\]

o Make a plan to invoke Jamie, the me when we let go, Fire (to draw), Penswer (ask if now or to schedule), Gaia:

o Megynn: (do you want to front?) no, later.

o Jamie: no

o Fire: \[worked on a half-sphere of blue fire\] Wanted to use open brush not tiltbrush

o Penswer: no

o Gaia: does tarot reading. Exhaustion, Projection, Guidance. Pretty obvious, right? Right.

Woke up and went in hallway and sinuses feel burning/allergic. Bad air quality but I'm not sure how it was so bad in house, especially since my air purifier doesn't always seem to detect it? But it's also been unreliable lately, over-showing red.

Ibuprofen last night and again today, and voltaren gel on the side rib, sternum, and back. Hoping it helps. A little worried that that's something I damaged and that it may not return to normal or may heal out of place.

Megynn did a lot of stuff this morning. Set her up with a channel in a tulpa discord.

How we are doing physically and emotionally:

o Physically: Took more ibuprofen. Seem to be pretty okay at the moment. Behind right shoulderblade is bothering me a bit. Traps tense.

o Emotionally: Better now that we did trigger points on collarbone. But in general not feeling anything. (M: I guess you're dissociated, huh.) yeah.

o Consciousness: "not here"

o The body: ow

o

o Fronter(s)?: who's fronting? idk

o üß•Megynn (she/her) - check-in and talk to me: I'm here! I'm happy. I like counting. \[as an exercise for parallel processing\]

o

o üå≥ Gaia (she/her)- check-in and front: I'm good. No fronting today.

o

o üß∂Jamie (she/her) - check-in, talk to me, call me to front: I'd like to write. \[set note to call Jamie to write\]

o

o Penswer - check-in, call to front: you're doing good

o

o Noemi√© \[The Fear / Frightened\] - scared of permanently breaking reality / going crazy and being unable to return, everything devolves into terrifying chaos \[West Knoxville branch library\] I'm good, thanks

o

o Invite any new parts; offer to add them to the queue with the stipulation that it is long:

o Talk to the part that's getting stressed about handlign new parts. (M: you okay? We'll handle it.) okay. \[part lets go\]

o Long-straight-haired woman standing on the sand by a beach, sound of ocean and seagulls overhead. Name Sande. (like signa?) no, I just like it. (Is there anything you want?) No, I just want to be here. (you can be here then)

o

o Talk with Megynn, Jamie, Jackson:

o Megynn: I'm good! We've been talking to me all day

o Jamie: when we write

o Jackson: I want to sleep. (you want to go dormant?) no, just sleep. \[we let him sleep. Says he doesn't need a bed or anything\]

Going to replace emergency water today. Skipped ASL meet-up because it was so PSE and also Jake showed up last time.

Woke up not feeling great, though I still managed to do morning chores. Running quite late. Continuing to put voltaren gel on rib etc. I think it may be getting a little better. Hope it's just some temporary thing that will go away if I'm gentle on it enough.

Left shoulder did start raising up / tensing and I pressed right shoulder down while lifting it up and that helped.

The right rib thing seems to be helped by kind of moving that part of my back forward.

Yesterday found Ana used my saffron up without telling/asking or requesting it be replaced, I burned the split pea soup, and I could not drain the emergency water automatically so it has to wait for Allie to order a spare part. I was sad basically all day and dealt with it by playing Slay the Spire until I was actively trapped and hearing myself ask to stop.

Running quite late today, probably because of pain.

Last night got right back of head/neck relaxed and straightened out!! Did nerve massages on upper back of earhole plus worked on holding head at an angle that felt good and caused the opposite side shoulder to relax. Spot in ear felt cold afterward. Helped with right side ribcage too. Left side was still bothering me, though. Also, pulled down/out on ear.

The trick is to find a position where it feels it's not touching internally or is touching less.

Had gone back out some this morning; I am doing it again.

Running out of active to-do items due to buddying with Zelle. Adding some Oculus stuff for fun.

Top of ear hole seems to help too.

Left side appears to be front of ear between ear and face.

We also were pulling up sinuses using internal muscles.

Trying tensing up right muscles to feel a space and wiggling head around a little. Made that spot in right ear feel cold.

Apprehension about answering emails \[someone volunteers to do it\], guilt and uncertainty about making friends with Tele.

Attempted to cut our hair evenly and it's just too short by our ears, or at least it was on one side so I cut the other side to match. It used to be longer and more ringlety and I feel we've lost that, possibly by cutting the back and sides too short.

Sinuses and upper right back of head (more upper than usual) feel dull and achy; probably need to do DMSO and magnesium. Am doing some nerve exercises above right ear and that seems to help though.

Still have not heard from dentist re Monday's aligner change.

Neck kind of achy, left rib issue, possibly from reading phone for a long time. Need to plug in phone \[done\].

Played Slay the Spire for several hours(?) last night. Was too tired to do anything else. Often crarsh in the evenings, I guess because no adderall anymore?

This morning I overheard Ana tell Maya to say help and then tell her twice that "Help" was easy to say, although it's clearly not easy for Maya, since she's never done it, rarely speaks in general, and has a very small vocabulary. It was disturbing and upsetting. Similar to when Maya was saying "no" to having her diaper changed and Ana was saying "you say no, I say s√≠! S√≠ s√≠ s√≠!" In general the pressure people have been putting on her to talk for months is upsetting, as well as stuff like grabbing her hands and trying to force her to sign, although I think they've stopped doing that. I hope they'll get a speech therapist who can reinforce this. I could talk to Allie about it, but I'm reluctant to "tell on" Ana, even though I feel like I ought to since Maya is small and helpless. The thought to talk to my therapist also occurs to me, but I can't imagine her giving me helpful advice rather than just seeing an "easy" solution.

We're going to talk about therapist after check-in, since some upsetting things have been happening.

Going to text dentist too although the thought I have when I do that is "I want to die".

Ana is here being loud. Hope she's just dropping Celeste off.

Yesterday Michael brought up in therapy twice the idea that breaking up was always a possibility but that it was also theoretical, then when we were talking about Eric and Allie it came up that if he didn't like Fremont post-pandemic he would want to move. Mario got him to drop mentioning the breaking up idea (although it didn't actually bother me that much) and called him on the moving thing (the moving thing was upsetting, a lot).

I had no idea where the moving thing came from; it just came out of nowhere and was totally different to what I'd been assuming (that living with Eric and Allie was our best option for a compromise and that Michael was okay with Fremont‚Äîbecause he told me that!).

I'm approaching wanting to tell him to just move out. I did tell him in session that I was pretty rattled by it, and we had a whole discussion where I said that I didn't want that to come up every two or three years if it was to make him feel comfortable about staying - that I wanted some sense of stability.

I was especially rattled that he brought it up without apparently realizing it would be a big issue for me, especially after all the talks we've had with each other and with Eric and Allie. I didn't mention that specifically in session.

We're going to discuss what he would need from a place to stay there indefinitely, and what I would need minimum to be comfortable living in a place.

I kind of want to just tell him that if he wants to move on he can do it without me. I'm not thrilled by this but I could get ASL-related work (maybe not) or look at developmental editing. I might be able to do part-time work and live off some of what I would get in a divorce, at least for a while, and move somewhere cheaper more permanently if necessary, although I'd much rather stay here. saf

Part of back between shoulders loosened after work on it last night and it popping in this morning. Now lower back (especially left side) is painful even when not putting weight on it. (May have improved after a minor pop of that specific part)

Supposed to go out to Dry Creek today with M and don't want to. Probalby air quality will prevent us.

Pain making me want to sleep I think. At least I put back the thing in my neck that was making me light headed after standing.

Good morning

Classes start today

I have been lightheaded for the past coupel days when standing, possibly related to thing in lower back. Did just get left shoulder to lower a little bit via head pulling

Went to dry creek yesterday with M. I dreaded it slightly but the ride there and back was fine although I got seriously winded walking up hills

Last night in cabs chat had discussion of talking/thinking stick idea, afterward more internal chatter and Megynn and Gaia fronted and I think we are getting better at fronter lending bits of braincell

Today helping Eric take car to mechanic at 11am

Writing this afternoon

Streamed slay the spire to CABS last night and it was fun

Ok! Head feels stuffy but back feels much better. Hips still burning a little but far less, and I feel upright. Right eye is seeing stuff a bit blurred/shadowed again, despite seeing very clearly at some more recent times.

Did a lot of stuff yesterday but failed to meet request to go for a walk. Maybe that needs to happen earlier? I could do it right after journaling if I reliably skim my inboxes to handle any urgent items before leaving.

Learning in toward computer physically seems to make things noticeably worse so scoot up and pull monitor toward me

o Catch M to talk about ADU

o Go for a walk

o Don't overdo it

How we are doing physically and emotionally:

o Physically: fairly good despite stuffy head and slightly burning lower back

o Emotionally: Guess we're feeling kind of enthusiastic? Not being in pain helps, and getting bass practice done helps, and making progress on stuff helps, and having the class helps

o Consciousness: good (are you the one feeling enthusiastic?) yes!

o The body: urgh (stomach achy)

o

o Fronter(s)?: \[you know, the fronter seems to disappear when we ask this and the thoughts become ones that are overheard by front rather than being front's thoughts\]

o

o üß•Megynn (she/her) - check-in and talk to me: good! Let's go for a walk!

o

o üå≥ Gaia (she/her)- check-in and front: I'm good (anythign you want to do?) no

o

o üß∂Jamie (she/her) - check-in, talk to me, call me to front: (what do you want to do?) be here (on the cliff?) yes. \[has a table and plate/utensils and is appreciating being alone and having space to feel things\]

o

o Invite any new parts; offer to add them to the queue with the stipulation that it is long:

o Angry part comes back: (we got rid of the therapist Saturday) that was good (anything else you want?) no

o Another part says: relax, relax, relax

o Talk with Megynn, Jamie, Jackson:

o They all say "go out"

I'm just not sure journaling and being in touch is doing anything. I'm just not sure we have enough influence over our life to meet anybody's needs. \[Relax\]

Yesterday wrote a lot, restarted exercise. Woke up at 5:30am and in pain. Feeling defeated about that.

Class today.

Did some Feldenkrais and it tentatively seems to have helped. We'll see if there's backlash, though.

How we are doing physically and emotionally:

o Physically: ok-ish, low back pain, some left side headache, eyes having trouble seeing unless very close

o Emotionally: still feeling bad from waking up in pain and starting to think about how therapy hasn't helped

o Idea to stop journaling for a while and focus on relaxing since I journal a lot but it's not convincing and I don't do anythign with it

o Consciousness: I think you should do that

I want to do some post-therapy and post-class-yesterday processing but I haven't got a clue what to do about it or any faith that it will go anywhere. I don't know how to have a safe place for reconstruing things; it all results in my taking on someone else's perspective or triggering the obsessive person. I don't feel like I can reinforce myself by saying over and over that my perspective was right - I've done that a lot and it hasn't done anything!

I just don't have any idea how to make progress. I don't know how to build safety other than managing my environments so they're not overwhelming. I don't have safe environments of the kind people think and I don't want to wind up obsessively mentally arguing with my therapist. All therapy seems to eventually come down to "relax, no one will hurt you" but that just doesn't help‚ÄîI come back again and again to the fact that I have to have some plausible belief that environments will somehow be different this time than they were before, as in better.

I am braced for judgementalness because when it hits me out of nowhere, I don't get validation or support from others. I don't get coregulation to help me calm down. It really doesn't help!

I don't know how to do this! I don't. A lot of the problem is that I'm hinting at myself that I'm going to leave a relatively non-overwhelming immediate environment (home) for one where I'm an outsider and will constantly be questioning my right to participate, in an environment that justifies others questioning that right too‚Äîand in an environment where I see so many similar issues that I'll want to connect.

It is the wanting to connect that keeps me from masking effectively.

Needing to explain makes things more and more distressing, especially when I'm constantly questioning why I'm explaining. I would like it to be because they're trying to understand things about me that they aren't understanding - the roadblacks in their own understanding - but it's sometimes about looking for points of vulnerability to use to get me to believe different things, or about believing that they're helping me "process" things.

What helps me process is two things that must accompany each other to work:

1\. Reinforcement that disability and the absence of support resulted in my experiences

2\. Support for disconnecting that awareness from my daily life OR support for arranging to actually mitigate disability and get that support

I have so much experience with being blown off. It doesn't help when therapists reinforce that. I'm just so tired.

I don't want to be trying to find your murky goals hidden behind your sympathy.

Sympathy does not substitute for action

Sympathy does not make things better

When you simultaneously understand why I do things and why others do things and provide a framework in which I can understand both of those things and see myself as a good person and not stand up for myself or have help dealing with the consequences

Word policing, thought policing, and looking for flaws in my thinking that will allow you to skip having to work with my constraints do not make a safe environment to process in.

A safe environment to process in is one in which:

\-\- Processing will take place in a framework that explains both my actions and others' reactions to me, in a way that makes it safe for me to think of me as a good person

\-\- One in which "can't" is real

Masking and suppression harm me, but the harm doesn't undo the necessity of doing so

Some means of reconciling the framework I've received from other people (and usually also receive in therapy) with a framework in which I'm

A need to believe I'm a worthy or valuable person without falling for the trap of advocating for it

A need to suppress a desire to reach out and say "this is hurting me, we have common goals, how can I get what I need to meet your goals".

A need for my past experiences to inform my present strategy. A need for both my average past experiences and my outliers to inform my social attempts; there is a risk/benefit tradeoff, and it matters that the risks of socially engaging are higher and the benefits lower than they would be for someone else‚Äîusually greatly so.

I don't know how to do this and I'm just exhausted.

In short:

\-\- reaching out and approaching people does not result in relationships

\-\- reaching out and approaching people does result in people who would otherwise tolerate me backing away

\-\- reaching out and approaching people occasionally results in someone actively targeting me to drive me out

\-\- establishing supportive friendships is neither a realistic nor a helpful goal, and my saying this isn't an attempt to convey some kind of hidden message; I mean, very literally, that the realistic goal is one in which I can exist on the fringes without attracting too much negative attention, as an alternative to not being in settings at all

\-\- I'm not sure why this is a thing I can't have

It is dependent on my navigating a series of (typically but not always) small challenges, not just dominance-style challenges (to see what I will actively accept) but passive-aggressive style challenges to see what I won't object to‚Äîoften accompanied by intense pushback if I do object

Some of that is inevitable‚Äîbut inevitable doesn't mean I have the skills to deal with it. The skills that have helped me deal with it are 1) awareness that I cannot actually address or alter it and 2) skills for ducking some of the consequences.

A need for not having a harmed emotional response

A need to not say "this is hurting me, stop" - a need to not betray the impact on me

Ongoing, persistent subtle attempts to alter my perception of risk and harm don't affect that risk and harm.

Woke up with neck very tight on mid right side; felt worse after lying down to eat breakfast; moved and low back popped (may have gone out again); eye patching now, and doing nerve massages and some Feldenkrais. Hope I'm not in some continuous downward spiral due to doing things to relieve pain.

Did some nerve massages on right lower side and it seemed to help with neck. Chest is achy; tried a feldenkrais-style lift-andhold-andrelax. May have helped? Who knows?

May have been due to Quest stuff (did a lot of it to try to fix streaming). Who knows?

Right side of head dull and achy and sparkly. Just feeling exhausted. If still feeling bad in March, see if I can make an optometrist appointment.

I did go to bed feeling unusually relaxed last night.

Put some voltarn gel on lower back

How we are doing physically and emotionally:

o Physically:

o Emotionally:

Hey all, whatever we're doing isn't working. We can't see a way to make things better - we feel fundamentally stuck and like we're getting abandond and abandoning ourselves. "Stop doing this" doesn‚Äôt help; I can't tell what you mean by it and I don't have enough info to guess and no, I don't know how to relax more without triggering even more distress, and I think you're aiming everything at front but we're not all the same. I am at a loss as to what to do and I'm not sure anyone else knows how either.

We stopped the therapist because she was on the verge of making us worse and nothing she was doing seemed ot result in us having to explain less. I know we're going through depression as a result of that break and as a result of the Ana-Celeste situation and as a result of the CABS server appearing to collapse again after a brief flurry of commitment, and after Wednesday's class that triggered us in the same way therapy would have - but no one is going to help us get out of this. I know it's awful. But we have to be the ones that help. No one is going to help us.

We can tell Michael that we're not going to get an ASL job. We can look into other career paths, or just tell him we can't do it at all. There are options.

I know we're in an absolutely stunning amount of distress but no one is going to remove it from us. It's up to us. That isn't just and isn't right, but it's the only thing we have a choice in dealing with. We don't have the option to have someone understanding support us, because our therapists do not know how to help us without trying to package in their beliefs about relational connection to external people solving all.

I know we don't have the ability to set up an internal structure that will help us, but we have to do that. We don't have other options. This is the option. We deal or we wander in misery.

We have to stop bouncing back and forth between things being okay and things not being okay. It is ruining our system and fucking up front.

I know you don't like this, but we can't get talking working. We had a system collapse last year basically or maybe a year and a half ago! We have to do this because if we don't somebody is gonna singlet hard and drop everything we've done. If we're not a resource we're going to get shoved aside.

You used to solicit advice from everyone.

I know, and the amount of time we had to spend on system thigns took fucking forever and that's why we weren't able to sustain it! I don't know if we merge down or what, but we have to have some way of sustaining ourselves in a reasonable amount of time so that we will actually continue doing checkins. I don't know if someone needs to take over as host! That would actually work fine but someone has to do it.

We have to get back into place. We were doing an expansive median thing but now we're not, because of the Ana and Celeste thing, and I know we want to go live by ourselves but we have no chance of doing that unless we can get a job!

Someone needs to do something! We need to rebel against the host and put someone else in place so that we can't force ourselves into bad situations anymore!

We have to be strong enough to not reach out. We need someone who can cut us off from our past in situations where sharing our past is infringing on someone else's experiences. OR we need someone who just does not give a shit. But we need someone who will get us through this. We need someone who will move things forward. We cannot just go murky and stuck.

We need to go back to having clear people who are voluntarily working together. I know things are awful! I know things collapsed! But no one is going to save us but ourselves. No one is going to acknowledge the way we work or our needs or limitations or come up with help for it but ourselves. No one. You cannot keep waiting and hoping. You don't get to give up! There are more people in here than just you! I know you're all terrified of getting exposed but we can't keep letting them singlet in front!

If we have to cut ourselves off from the past, we have to cut ourselves off from the past. We have to try things. If that is literally the only message the therapist will give us and if the conclusion we've come to is that we can't function in the way she wants then we can't function in the way she wants.

We need to band together to MAKE CHANGE HAPPEN.

The only message from therapists is that we are doing this to ourselves over and over and over and they want to force us into the situation and we do not want to be in there and if we're going to function we have to take ourselves seriously. I know, I know, I know it's horrible but we've gotten people in front! We've cut bad parts off before! We can reevaluate our past in the light of selective frames of mind that allow us to view ourselves positively. We can! Dissociate! From the bad shit! We can pull in more cautious headmates in social situations! But we have to act! We have to help ourselves!

We have to draw on our resources to be functional I don't care if you don't want to

We are not functioning right

Being no one isn't working! Bweing no one doesn't hide us! Being no one doesn't keep us safe!

We have to find a way to think of ourselves as good despite what everyone is telling us

We can accept that we are trapped and that double binds are horrific; we do not have to solve them for a therapist.

If th eproblem really is that we have to be immoral to survive, then we will do that and not try to kid ourselves into believing that it is prosocial

In a minute I am going to do a roll call and ask everyone whether they are on board for a hostile takeover of the host and then we will do it

We will set up boundaries to prevent past experiences from interfering

We will design combinations of traits and self perceptions to get us through whatever immediate situation it is. We will not fuck ourselves up over and over. Other pe\]

See, that was a good job. It got us through an interaction raising positive feelings! We felt the feelings! That is what we need to project in social situations and if we hit a bump we reevaluate at home and decide if someone else needs to handle that social situation! We do not generalize! We do not do abusers' work for them! We do not police in different situations! If we get harmed, someone else deals with it.

Dissociation is necessary for us and it is healthy for us and we do not have to listen to people who tell us it is not.

I am going to fucking wake everybody up and we will get onboard.

Yesterday went to park with Maya and Allie and Michael. Swung her in the swing. Took tricycle. Saw the 1500-square-foot house. Also went to a 1k-sq-ft house. It was small and depressing and cramped but Allie seemed very serious about it, I guess because it was 1.2mil instead of 1.7 or more. It has three bedrooms and she wants to add on but I don't think I would be able to live there.

Michael said last night qwhat he needs to live in a place in definitely is community. I think it's clear he'd like to move to Berkeley or Austin. I'm almost willing to say ok let's move to Berkeley but if I move I won't have Maya and I will go back to not getting any physical touch again. It feels like it would be fine but I'm basing that on how I feel now with those things.

Back of head feels swollen and not letting blood through. Working on it.

Felling dizzy and sick though.

Did livestream CABS and feel bad about it because practically requiring others to show up.

How we are doing physically and emotionally:

‚Ä¢ Physically: kinda fuzzy headed and mucusy; maybe been having an allergic reaction? Lifting up chest seems to super help

‚Ä¢ Emotionally: eh. Mostly dissatisfied from head achy. Would like to feel clear and light. (yes, I know we should stop doing VR)

‚Ä¢ Consciousness: I'm all right.

‚Ä¢ The body: not great

‚Ä¢ Bending over to clean ponies so we could stand without getting dizzy was also not great

‚Ä¢ Doing more of the sternum loosening seems to really help a lot though. Just generally want to feel better.

‚Ä¢ Depressed from spending all my time in my room

‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢ Experience of beign in front: body does not feel good. Feeling bluh from that, down from conversation swith Michael about moving (resentful, depressed), and a little stressed about spending 2 hours signing today will

‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢ üß•Megynn (she/her) - check-in and talk to me: better now, thanks. That chest thing was really helpful.

‚Ä¢ Daye: (you feeling down?) No, I'm just quiet.

‚Ä¢ Elizabeth: I'm all right. I'm ready to go.

‚Ä¢ üß∂Jamie (she/her) - check-in, talk to me, call me to front: Im all right. \[visualize her in her clifftop house\] I like it here.

‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢ Talk with Megynn, Jamie, Jackson:

‚Ä¢ Jamie: no I'm good

‚Ä¢ Megynn: front later when doing stuff downstairs/outside (not cooking)

‚Ä¢ Jackson: I would like you to go for a wlak, but you don't have to right now.

‚Ä¢ Make a plan to invoke Jamie, the me when we let go, Fire (to draw):

‚Ä¢ Jamie: no, not today. (do you want us to stop asking you?) no, not yet.

‚Ä¢ Right now I feel kind of armored against the house and Michael instead of relaxed.

Critical issues (admin meeting)

You got any issues?

‚Ä¢ Megynn: nope, I'm good

‚Ä¢ Daye: I'd like to be here for a minute. I switched in to calm us down.

‚Ä¢ Elizabeth: I think we should talka bout ourselves.

‚Ä¢ The three of us?

‚Ä¢ Yes.

‚Ä¢ What about us?

‚Ä¢ E: how do we get along? What are we like?

‚Ä¢ To set up boundaries?

‚Ä¢ Yes, that.

Daye: Well, I'm very calm, and I'm a writer. I do need to be alone, but when there's no one actively present who can see/talk to us I can invoke a sense of aloneness. I do feel kind of trapped in the apartment sometimes, but I like being here. Unlike Elizabeth, I provide more space; I'm less active, in a way. I'm calmer than Megynn, too.

Elizabeth: I'm the newest. I grew up. I'm busy and energetic and doing things, but I'm also integrative, I guess like Terre, yeah - handling a lot of things, keeping on top of stuff, drawing in more resources to deal with people complexly. Unlike Daye, I'm involved in motion and action; unlike Megynn, I'm less chill and less social.

Megynn: Weird inhabiting right after you all, huh. I'm the social one. I don't censor like Elizabeth does and I'm not busy like she is. I'm younger and more enthusiastic and I want to try new things. Unlike Daye, I'm approaching others. I'm also more likely to ask consciousness to do stuff for us.

Should we talk about division of responsibilities? Do people want to claim their own?

‚Ä¢ Daye: I calm us down. I help ensure psychological boundaries so that we don't invite other people into our alone space. I'm not as good at setting boundaries in public; I'll leave that up to Elizabeth. But I keep other people from coming into our head. Oh, and I can write.

‚Ä¢ Megynn: I make sure we go out and do stuff and have fun and don't stay here all the time. I make sure we're not doing stuff all the time although I help with doing stuff! We gotta remember to have fun and see people.

‚Ä¢ Elizabeth: I guess I have to be responsible for setting boundaries, huh? I'm not thrilled with that, and I might wind up turning it over to the more offensive people. (Like Rain?) Like Rain. But I can provide input when we're back here. I can also make sure that we do complex stuff integrating across categories - taking in information from a variety of sources, being what we think of as an "adult" - but I don't think I should be here all the time; it'll wipe us out.

‚Ä¢ Rain: yeah sure I'll do it.

‚Ä¢ Thank you!

Should we discuss holes in our coverage?

‚Ä¢ Megynn: maybe later

‚Ä¢ Daye: I'd like to discuss them now

‚Ä¢ Elizabeth: we could discuss them now

Holes:

‚Ä¢ Elizabeth: We've been studying, but we don't have a study-er. I can do that, but I'm not sure I should. Also, I'm not sure who we're letting interface with Michael. (I think we're just trying to keep ourselves away from him.) Yes, I think we probably are.

‚Ä¢ At some point, we'll need to discuss what we'll do without Michael. (Yes, I think we probalbywill.)

‚Ä¢ Daye: we have people who surface to do things, but who we may not have identified as people, like the person when writing or like Elizabeth said, with Michael. We still don't know who interfaces with Maya. Could it be me? I suppose it could, but I don't think it is. Either way, we should decide if we should try to see these as people, or task states, or what.

‚Ä¢ Elizabeth: I think they're task states.

‚Ä¢ Megynn: yes, I think they're task states

‚Ä¢ Are we okay with viewing them as not one of us, but also not a named person?

‚Ä¢ I'm not super cool with it.

‚Ä¢ Daye: I don't know if I am either. We don't want to force them to be a person or a state.

‚Ä¢ Could they be temporary fusions?

‚Ä¢ Daye: I suppose they could be, but I'm not sure they are.

‚Ä¢ Maybe just collectives?

‚Ä¢ Daye: Yes, I guess they could be collectives, and we just don‚Äôt know who makes them up.

‚Ä¢ Elizabeth: I think they're collectives.

‚Ä¢ Megynn: yeah, collectives.

‚Ä¢ Do we need to address them? No, we'll just let people come in and out.

‚Ä¢ Agree

‚Ä¢ Agree

‚Ä¢ And it's okay if it's just a kind of collective. (Yes.)

‚Ä¢ So who do we need focused people for?

‚Ä¢ Daye: We need focused people for breaks. We have to unbind.

‚Ä¢ Megynn: we need focused people to do things, like socialize (like provide impetus?) yeah. (so to shift states?) exactly!!

‚Ä¢ Elizabeth: we need focused people to not be on autopilot.

‚Ä¢ So we're like components of executive function?

‚Ä¢ Mmm maybe?

‚Ä¢ I don't know, I'm not sure I like thinking of us like that.

Potential list of holes

‚Ä¢ Study-er (a signer's going to have to be a collective though)

‚Ä¢ Daye: I could do it, I suppose

‚Ä¢ Backed by a collective

‚Ä¢ Do we want to let it be a collective for dealing with Michael?

‚Ä¢ Yes, one person isn't enough

‚Ä¢ Agree

‚Ä¢ Agree

‚Ä¢ Megynn: I'm taking exercise

‚Ä¢ Daye: I can do pain management as well

‚Ä¢ Elizabeth: I should do desk stuff, but you (Daye) can handle downstairs stuff

‚Ä¢ Daye: and I'll call in Rain when needed. But Elizabeth needs to handle the more complex stuff. (Agreed.)

‚Ä¢ Call Harvest in for gardening?

‚Ä¢ Socializing is tricky, and maybe we should postpone it for later (agreed x 2)

‚Ä¢ Daye: I don't want to do morning stuff

‚Ä¢ Elizabeth: I can do some morning stuff (can we get you together?) we can try

‚Ä¢ Megynn: I'll do it sometimes but not all the time

Downstairs routine stuff: Daye (enjoy the house), calling Rain in as needed

Early morning getting going: Elizabeth and Megynn trade off every other day (Megynn: odd days; Elizabeth: even days)

Pain management: Daye

Bass: Megynn

Dailies: Megynn

Elizabeth: Desk stuff

ASL: Daye (backed by collective)

Exercise: Megynn

Elizabeth: Food prep

Michael: collective

Evening stuff: Daye (calling others in as necessary) to help us downramp

Ana out sick. I hope not Covid.

Woke up at 5, eventually fell back asleep, got up on time. Megynn asked consciousness to get us moving a couple times and we moved. It's Megynn's day for early morning but we forgot for a bit and Elizabeth did it but that's okay.

When I woke up my left nostril was totally clear although it feels achy/blocked again. Am guessing that's related to the eye nerve thiung.

Yesterday actually ran out of to-do's to do (not completely but mostly). I did some work on the garden. Worried the roses might die; going to order mite killer after I research it.

Did 10 calla hips yesterday and seem to be ok so far with the new Feldenkrais. Am doing chest lifts, left shoulder lifts, and jaw clench-relax.

Note that vision seems sharper both in general and when looking slightly down at screen (i.e. sitting up very tall).

Last atenolol was 3 days ago. Am trying stopping it this week. We'll see how it goes tonight - in the past when we lower it, it's 3-4 days after that it hits.

Check-in

This is our daily check-in. The purpose is to try to keep channels open in preparation for working out future concerns. We're not going in-depth right now, just saying hi.

Remember the others are doing a trial run standing up for the one in front and the one in front is doing a trial run not singleting

What is an action I can take to improve things for myself today, in terms of increasing my firmness against others?

o Can call Rain in for the class if we're stressed

How we are doing physically and emotionally:

o Physically: Pretty good shape. Discomfort esp lower left back but chest and head are pretty good. (Lower back relaxes when we put chest up enough)

o Emotionally: Better than usual.

o Consciousness: okay (anything you need?) no

o The body: achy but all right

o

o Experience of being in front: back of head and neck continue to feel swollen, low-key but persistent and don't remember last time we didn't feel like this

o

o üß•Megynn (she/her) - check-in and talk to me: I'm doing good! I'm happy to be here.

o Daye: I'm all right. I'm kind of tired. (Anything we can do for that? Get out more) No.

o Elizabeth: Closest to front, I guess. I'm all right. A little sad about possibly having to move out at some point and leave the baby. Just in general grieving, I guess? For what we had and lost. (CABS server, I think, and also having a house that was partly our own)

o üß∂Jamie (she/her) - check-in, talk to me, call me to front: (do you want to front today?) No. (Anything you need?) No.

o

o Talk with Megynn, Jamie, Jackson:

o Megynn: no need. If I'm here you could talk to me though! I like when people talk to me.

o Jamie: no

o Jackson: no

o Make a plan to invoke Jamie, the me when we let go, Fire (to draw):

o Jamie (not today)

o Hard letting go today I guess

o Fire going to draw now

Business

M: ok everybody we need to discuss system meeting tom

M: I think we should do it. Wake everybody up

D: I don't think so. We just decided it should be the three of us for a while.

M: but shouldn't we announce it

D: No.

E: I don't think we should. We nearly had a system collapse; that overrides our promises to others.

I don't think it does.

M: okay but I don't like it

E: I think we need to go slowly and make space for others. As in, just function now. Focus on outer life. Later we can bring people in.

It won't bother them?

No, it won't.

We will reassess in two weeks.

Abdominal cramps. After gardening; maybe related, maybe not. Took 4 ibuprofen without food as they were getting disabling.

Need to pull back on commitments to others disrupting dailies etc.

Yesterday full of Maya board stuff. It felt a little manic and in fact it turns out endever* is probably having a hypomanic episode (which they are calling mania, idk, seems like part of their tendency to overdescribe disability that they have shifted it, but it's possible their dx changed or something).

Today trying out Zelle's idea of having minimum and ideal versions of the same task. I'm doing one round with the most basic version and returning if there's time later.

An action I can take to improve things for myself today: we did it, we did the min and ideal versions of tasks and stuck to min

Got period yesterday - was not expecting for another week, but now it makes sense why the last week was kinda bad. I do feel better all over even if face is kind of tight. It feels like period just makes me both floppy and tense and I think it's hormones making my joints floppier.

Asked in MMOV last night about un-singleting after enjoyable events and got a surprising number of responses but none were particularly helpful. Decided to mute the server since we don't see a compatible way (any way) for us into the social scene there and we feel we've gotten a lukewarm-to-cold response every time we've posted; there doesn't seem to be any sense of empathy. Muted other servers too since we don't spend much regular time on Discord these days.

How we are doing physically and emotionally:

o Physically: Better, but still not at our best, even now

o Emotionally: Low-level irritation and tiredness even though we feel like we're doing a good job getting things done. Still feeling lots of stress from having to cut things off early; it just makes us feel like we never actually accomplish \*anything\*.

o Consciousness: I'm okay (anything we can do for you?) love me. \[we send love\]

o The body: ow. (still not recovered yet?) no.

o

o Experience of being in front: feels like a muddy soup of emotions, many contrasting

o

o Megynn: I am excited to be here. \[we want other people to provide emotiosn for us I guess? Someone thinks pretty derogatorily about that. But we do, and that seems to be what cofronting does - blocks out muddy background emotion with clear present emotion\] yes! I think that's it.

o Jackson: thank you, consciousness \[got ibuprofen and robe\] okay, let's go. (anytying else you'd like?) no, I'm done.

o Elizabeth:

o "you don't let me front" - kid's voice

o We turn people into imagined people to solve problems and then they can't be themselves

o Ok, the issue is that we don't know how else to get people to front other than calling our felt/imputed sense of them to front. We don't know of other ways to invoke them.

o Ivvy: too much. (playing with Maya?) yes.

I'm worried that now that I've ended the atenolol I'm having POTS symptoms again. Also, my eyes seem permanently tired.

I'm not sure I've been sleeping well the last few days. Last night I couldn't sleep - I think if I take melatonin on an empty stomach it kicks in fast enough that I miss my window. I should try to have a regular snack.

My TMJ with using the chewies seemed to reduce greatly after I got my period.

Super tired last night, just kind of crashed. Installed Twitter on my phone because I couldn't get myself up to use the computer. Michael and I went for a walk and I was very tired. Have been easily disoriented by having to change gaze direction/height. He saved me by making me a shake.

I went to the post office and asked who wanted to front on the way back and I think it was Noe? It was relaxing and freeing and I felt great. I think it was being away from everyone else. I felt connected.

We are wavering a lot in how much we want other people there, like do we really want it or just because others have it.

Did work to relax head and shoulders some and now abdominal cramping.

More picture boards for Maya last night. Allie thought endever* was an SLP and I said no an autistic adult and now I'm worried about her rejecting it. Or Eric rejecting it. Stressed and strain-y/singlet-y over fear of being seen as deceptive/icky unless I come up with official sources. Want to ask Endever but I know they won't know that any more than I know good official sources for autistic kids beyond TPGA.

Hoping cramping will go away with more chest stretching upward. Wishing this bullshit would stop.

Bluh. Just‚Ä¶good but tired? Good but headachy? In a continuous mild headache daze for months? I love that my teeth are improving, and yet. I wonder how many months of refinements I'll have. She said 8 months but. I'm guessing more.

Don't remember when I started. Maybe it was july? I think it was later because that was just fillings. But it wasn't November because that was when I went in around aligner 10. At 2 weeks each that's 20 weeks which is 5 months which seems like too much.

I am annoyed Eric and Allie did not respond to my request to arrange to go out so I could check the smoke detectors.

They are trying to buy a house. I hope they get the house. I do not think it has cooling which is too bad.

Feeling profoundly exhausted. Just by everything.I'm coping but it feels like all new stuff is stressful. May have to do with atenolol reduction who knows. Don't want it to be because don't want to have to ask GP about it. Or psych. Because they'll want me to see an autonomic doctor.

Doing eye patch to see if it helps.

I want this to be from orthodontia, I really do, but I'm worried it's not.

An action I can take to improve things for myself today: some relaxing

How we are doing physically and emotionally:

o Physically: very head tight, body aching - woke up feeling bad especially left mid-low back and haven't made much progress

o Emotionally: way stressed from writing doc thing and just feeling stressed in general. Also, cold.

Singleted from the Maya thing. Those projects are bad for us they're bad they're bad

Also asking for help on MMOV and getting met with "that doesn't happen" was bad

It sure was

That's the general problem, that we have to allocate journal time to listening and an't do parts work and then don't do journal time

And then we spiral and spiral and spiral and yell at ourselves

Go for walks by self to think to talk

Do it

Got to get out of here

Eat then go

O it

Back pretty loose today except for right side neck pulling top of body over to left. But otherwise working on chin yesterday helped.

Hair on right side underneath has gone straight again. This will be a big problem when I'm out in the world again.

Vday date last night with M. Played Tick Tock: A Game for Two. Was mostly pretty fun though didn't quite finish. Characters and story didn't grab me but the mechanic was relaxed fun.

Offered to Allie and Eric a low- or no-cost loan to cover the relevant part of the mortgage for up to year if one of them loses their job. If we're living with them.

They're turning in an offer on the house today. Apparently that agent likes to take multiple rounds ugh. Buying a house sounds insanely stressful.

Tuesday I played games in the morning with Julie and then Wednesday and Thursday I was not able to stick to schedule. Today I'm trying to get it back on track.

I've been doing a lot of work on my body to try to keep it manageable. Currently using an eyepatch to see if it helps. My left lower back has been bothering me since I exercised despite being very good prior to then. Feels like something out place but don't know if it is or how to set it back.

It feels like there are just too many things going on. I feel grumpy and bad because of Celeste who just inspires this godawful kneejerk reaction in me. Just. So much. I want to fly into a rage every time she speaks.

Finished writing class today (immersion class). Signed up for Fab 30. Need to make sure I don't mov to Colorado and do Margie's dishes.

Back of neck esp right side feels very tight/swollen/achy, although I was able to keep it in check well enough to participate fully in the writers workshop. I've been tryign to put it back into shape but it doesn't seem to want to go, or maybe it has gone but the nerve's still stuck.

Sure feels like there's a bone out of place.

Very very tired.

Today had dental cleaning. If she'd replied to me a week and a half ago I could have gotten my scan for the aligners done today and not had to come in next week and I'm irrirated about that, about how difficult it's been to clearly understand what's going on.

I paid on the wrong card today because I didn't think I could figure out what other card to use and I'm not happy with that and anxious. M won't like that if he notices and it's part of a larger trend where I just go along in the moment. Like getting off the bus at the wrong stop because I said I wanted to get off at BART and I guess he thought I meant BART way not the bart station?

Feeling suddenly depressed. Maybe because I overheard Allie talking to Celeste about how Celeste says things to Ana when angry and it terrifies Ana that she won't have a place to live, and then Allie asked her mom if she could remember not to say things when angry, and it just depresses me to see that dynamic again - where someone is completely unable to change and yet everyone around them thinks that asking them will be enough to get them to change. I just don't see evidence that Celeste can change anything, or that Ana can change anything. And I'm so tired of changing myself. And I can't believe

I guess I'm in shock and desperation at the depth to which people optimistically and wishfully think that others will change in the face of their past experiences.

Today I tried putting my distance glasses on with my reading clip ons and doing some close up phone work and my neck started relaxing immediately. I do not think I should use the progressive ones anymore; I'm increasingly sure they're just the wrong prescription.

I also did straighten out my distance glasses some and I think my progressives are still crooked but that doesn't help that much.

I'm just wiped and worn down. Too much writing.

CABS stuff: Yesterday Helio posted a long accusatory rant with some internal contradictions. It included a lot of resentment for our not approaching inactive server members to find out why they weren't there anymore, as well as saying a new server wouldn't work unless we all figured out what we did wrong and how to fix it‚Äîincluding expressing frustration that people kept bringing up the past. They also expressed frustration that members talked and tried to come to consensus instead of letting the modding team handle things‚Äîeven though the modding team's failure to handle things promptly was behind a lot of the conflict.

I feel that they're taking their frustrations with BC out on us because we were able to actually successfully get folks to a consensus. I didn't like being yelled at by Helio like that. Even if it wasn't explicitly directed at us it was explicitly directed at the current initiative to start a new server.

It was very hard to write a calm response to that that didn't get sucked into trying to manage their emotions for me.

I am sad tele left. I very nearly left. Helio's angerpost was uncalled for, and completely unconstructive, and basically wanted us to all atone and fix ourselves before trying anything new. I'm not happy about that.

Comfy Sleepy's feedback included anger about the google doc's length (while making a massive long series of posts).

They are both very much asking me to fix their emotions/triggers for them while objecting to other people doing that and I'm just not doing it.

I'm dejected that we won't have Helio on board since they were a major route to our getting potential members, and since they suggested all of the potential invitations we have from invite-recs.

I've seen this dynamic a number of times, where someone withholds feedback and participation until a decision is made, then unloads on everyone because they didn't feel included. How dare we move on without you? But that's exactly what we're doing: moving forward with people who expressed an interest in moving forward.

She's more in touch with people than I am and I'm sad.

But I don't want to be in touch with them. I miss Shiv but I also very much do not want to be in touch with him.

It was a good visit. But I'm sad.

Friday new headmate Amy/Amalthea (Amaryllis). Posts from not-cabs for reference:

1\. Telluric ‚Äî 03/11/2022

last night brain gifted us with a round of immersive daydreaming, which has not happened in a long time. it was enjoyable and we got some needed characterization work done for one of our characters who was underdeveloped.

2\. \[9:29 PM\]

as a bonus good thing even though it was late in the evening we were then able to fall asleep with no problems which did not use to happen

Megynn \[Telluric System\]BOT ‚Äî 03/11/2022

I'm getting a new headmate out of it!

3\. \[9:30 PM\]

we all are but this one is my friend

4\. Telluric ‚Äî 03/11/2022

We commented on immersive daydreaming in good things and thought we'd talk a bit about it here because it's something we're thinking about

5\. \[10:12 PM\]

We don't do it much at all now, mainly because when we did more of it (up through our 20s) it was closer to maladaptive daydreaming, although the term didn't exist until after we stopped afaik

6\. \[10:14 PM\]

More of either an escape for real life that made things more unpleasant after a session, or as a kind of repetition thing that was less about daydreaming content and more about trying to evoke and sustain a specific brain state

7\. \[10:16 PM\]

It helped with some things while also making self-regulation (doing things at regular times and falling asleep) harder

8\. \[10:17 PM\]

The more moderate version (like the kind that happened last night) is useful in writing because it helps us develop characters, plan out scenes, and look forward to doing the actual writing of the thing we imagined

9\. \[10:19 PM\]

We had already stopped doing the maladaptive stuff a fair bit by the time we realized we were plural a couple years ago, and then we stopped pretty much completely because we were worried we were annoying headmates by doing a lot of repetitive stuff

Followup thoughts to our Friday posts re immersive daydreaming in heavy https://discord.com/channels/951184256409931786/951199760566587404/952086241556447322 We had a discussion at one point in the other server about whether the repeating phrases/conversation replay loops we have sometimes could be consciousness or a particular headmate trying to get and/or keep that headmate in front. Since we tend to switch in response to situations, any kind of repeated thinking was basically creating an internal "situation" for the purposes of preventing switching, although we weren't aware of being plural at the time. It occurred to us that when we were younger, maladaptive daydreaming might have been doing the same thing, since we did it narrowly and repetitively. Friday's experience was different because it was about imagining and exploring, rather than trying to lock in specific mental states to maintain control. And I think that's why it was a better experience and also we got (are getting?) a new headmate out of it. It was working with our plurality instead of trying to suppress it.

Feeling a little panicky about schedule disruption. Having cramps and fuzzy head, about to get period probably and it's not helping, plus Vyvanse am using the older stuff that's not working well in the same quantity. Maybe I better try whole pills. At least for tomorrow.

Wanting a lot of reassurance.

Thought: maybe it is pressure inside my head that causes my top bit to go out of place, rather than vice verasa

Today I discovered cranial facial stuff!! I mobilized my facial bones and it feels so much better - it really touches that internal pain areas on my inside of my head.

Today is a catch-up day where I try to get stuff done in preparation for moving stuff.

Took more of a vyvanse today - I'm on the old ones because I ran out of new ones but I think the old ones have lost effectiveness, on top of my menstrual cramping last week.

Yesterday did a bunch of cranial sacral stuff. This morning after lying down with hand to right side of head, my left ear filled up. I think the eustachian tube is blocked. I have been working on it. Stroking eustachian tube and pushing back of neck to left seems to help most so far. A little worried but Ill deal. I do feel much better physically.

Pushed Allie last night to just do moving stuff without Eric. I don't want to do that again. Was it worth it? Maybe, but I don't think it's worth risking making me The Problem. Or bringing up that last time I did it further.

I should stay out of her relationship.

I should do it by suggesting positive things, not saying negative things about Eric.

Just wiped. Probably from moving boxes yesterday. Head feels swollen. Probably craniosacral stuff contributed. At least left ear is mostly normal.

Lower back hurts.

Got feedback from Robin Olson on my first scene that she loved it but it would cause all agents and publishers to reject it and not tell me why, or to tell me to reduce it to a paragraph. I'm feeling very despondent about this because of the number of hours of effort I put in on that scene, and because of the difficulty I had getting all the necessary backstory in - and then doing it, and feeling good about it, and getting good feedback from Margie. Plus the fact that no one else has revised mine except for my partners. Did I offend someone? It's impossible to tell.

This move is stressing me out and I'm unable to enjoy it because I'm unable to coordinate or get any promises of cooperation, largely because Eric and Allie are unwilling to admit they don't have time or energy to do it, and my pushing them to acknowledge that triggers anxiety and resistance.

I have a lot of anxiety about arranging shelves because people will ignore the signs as soon as they are up.

It's a large household, and I regret that we can't do it cooperatively because of Ana.

God, I wish she would leave.

I'm feeling exhausted and depressed. The extra l-theanine? The attempt to skip Vyvanse? I can't tell.

Took Vyvanse at 9:34.

The lack of Vyvanse seems tohav made playing games less interesting but also to make it very hard to overcome my dejection at my inability to arrnage the move to not be disorienting and require constant coordination.

Super painful lying down last night, frontal face felt smashed and crowded. Today tried wiggling sphenoid bone and pressing up on back of upper palate, which has made a huge difference.

Am attempting to skip vyvanse. Moving slow but doesn't seem terrible.

Not sure if I'm depressed or just in pain / no vyvanse.

Have been pushing up against upper back of hard palate with tongue, and sometimes with fingers. It seems to fix important things. I really did feel like it was sagging; I guess it never occurred to me that it might be something I could reach that way.

Eric stress rent he miscalculated or typo'd but he thinks it's not important and wants to brush it off irritatedly and irresponsibly. I am angry at him.

After that, went out with M for walk. Stressed over Eric rent and then we were a kid with Michael and then obsessive and afraid on walk while le talking about it and then came back and remembered the mdterie password when pulling up our password manager.

We decided after look at Eric's calculations that $2k was reasonable because it's their property tax plus their proportion of mortgage that goes toward interest plus something else, I forget what. By my calculations it

Here it is:

rent based on: interest plus property taxes plus property insurance

$5751

$2.30/foot

This is assumign the dining troom will be Mayaland and the living room will be public space and 1/3 of the sunken room will be proivate space for offices.

I think we have a few people around:

\-\- main person/adult

\-\- kid with the nonstandard sentences

\-\- rage loop

ask new splits if they want to join old? what if they a new member fronts, then joins someone else?

Sudden headache. Exercised a bit ago. Extra headaches may have onset with beginning lower body Muldowney. Probably need to stop.

Been playing Adventure Capitalist, Probably need to stop that too.

Feeling kinda uninterested in everything. And have for a while. Hoping it's not the lamictal. A little worried.

Maybe if I just knew what to move forward on and weren't waiting for Eric and Allie.

And weren't so muddled on my novel. And had goals and deadlines and progress meters.

I did raise my loratidine back up in hopes it would help.

Afraid of getting in trouble for staining the bathroom marble. Ashamed of it.

Sinuses esp left upper sinus giving me problems. Lower back achy. Generally don't feel wonderful.

I did meet with Allie yesterday re house and it helped. Talked about a bunch of stuff including lease. I floated the corral idea past her, and then later past Eric along with the other stuff.

\-\-\-\-

Thinking about how I told Susan Carter (therapist) I was suicidal when I was 16 and she utterly blew it off. I finally opened up to her about something very serious I was ashamed about and she flunked it horribly. It was a phenomenal betrayal. I feel even writing about this that I must be exaggerating (not exaggerating what she did or said, but uncharitably casting it as negative).

Michael met Kris in Berkeley on Sunday. Last night he found out Kris had a covid exposure Sat pm at a dance party. Less than 16 hours before meeting with M, so almost certainly fine even if he was exposed.

On our walk, I kept asking M for more information and he kept giving one detail at a time and then said he didn't know any more. I tried to get him to tell me what Kris told him, and he evaded that too. It was incredibly frustrating and I got angry. I think he might understand why, but I also feel like he still thought it was wrong of me to keep pushing and then get angry.

As a result of getting angry, I finally got the info I needed:

\-\- it was a masked exposure at a dance party (I had to drag this out of Michael, who insisted he'd told me everything in chat, but hadn't mentioned this)

\-\- Kris does not know who it was or whether he was close to them (Michael also did not clarify this, and I could not tell from what he put in chat that Kris did not know)

\-\- Michael and Kris met outside, I think unmasked

\-\- The incubation period for delta would have made contagion in under a day impossible. It is very unlikely it could have happened with omicron, but we don't 100% know for sure.

"Kris was just informed that he was exposed to someone with COVID on Saturday night, less than 16 hours after the end of the time I was with him.

That makes it very unlikely that he could have been contagious at the time, but we can't be 100% sure until he gets tested a couple of days from now"

I also got a promise that he'd put details on slack when he got back. He did not do that.

Up. Doing a new accountability buddy thing with Nikita (DreadNautilus) and Nikhi on Discord. Going well so far - I'm up and doing stuff earlier than normal. Maybe extra social pressure (and reliability) will help.

Still putting off going to the bathroom which suggests to me I am urgently trying to do things but I will be ok. I'm going to do that right after this, at any rate.

Sleepign in the den last night and the night before and tonight. On the air mattress. I think it's better for my back tbh. Also I can sleep on my back with my arms up which is nice.

Going to try to do some garage organization (gardening and kitchen implement shelves). I will also hopefully finish or mostly finish the Dear Parent letter and work a little on the Dear Legislator letter. I'm taking a break from writing becauseI just crashed repeatedly trying to figure out the gateway scene.

Reorganized spices yesterday. Resenting Ana for buying large amounts of spice and using us as a storage space.

May have put top of neck in.

Lilisystem joined Timezone and now there are a lot of discussions! I'm relieved and a little intimidated I guess.

Need to check in with Melissa of the Group today about the Group.

Doing a lot of moving stuff this weekend. Taking stuff to garage, putting stuff in garage. Need to clear off shelves for the taking.

And various other things.

Made optometrist appt yesterday finally.

Think I have a lot of mental noise in back. Arguing.

Talked with M on Thurs about the communication failure. Had to really point out it was a trust issue since I kept trying to get info and then he promised and then he didn't do it. Still not sure he understands it. He finally worked through to the fact that he was being avoidant because he was worried people would be angry. He knows he has a tendency to take care of something and then not communicate.

Still not sure he really gets it.

\-\-\-\-

After tonight's talk with Melissa of the Group: Melissa's message was "You are here with us. You are us. You remember us. I'm you, but you're not me. They're you, and you're them." And now she says she's done and not to contact her again.

I‚Äôm pretty angry. None of this makes any sense. I wanted to get some insight or some new understanding, and it's just confusing bullshit that makes me think either my subconscious is just putting out random crap or they're all being phenomenally unhelpful. Some of the other responses I've gotten from talking to myself/in-system people has genuinely been helpful, but this just was‚Ä¶not.

Reading more and listening to stuff on boundaries and on emotional neglect. A lot of the emotional neglect badly confuses clear emotional abuse with emotional neglect. It's very frustrating.

We might not be dysfunctional as a system, we might just be hiding and/or more integrated, but I just do not know what to do

And it really does not help to hear "stop doing this"

I guess we're in distress but they can't necessarily verbalize how or why

And trying to help them is making things worse maybe? Makes it harder to contact

Brain was protecting us maybe

\-\-\-\-\-\-

What suggestions do you have for books on boundaries that don't require you to dissociate from your sense of empathy? Or any advice on handling situations where setting your boundaries means being avoidant and nonresponsive in ways that were traumatizing when they happened to you?

The person I'm having trouble coping with is a housemate's relative who moved in with us last year. She's polite, laid-back, and easy-going. She's elderly, grieving, extroverted but socially isolated, and has had health problems that have left her with memory issues that seem to also heavily impact her judgment and ability to learn, and to make her frequently rely on others to orient her about small things.

When she sees me around the house, she tries to start a social interaction, usually with an indirect ask for help (like "I'm looking for my phone. I just can't find it anywhere") or a statement of fact about a task of hers ("I did my paperwork") or sometimes a direct question about something my roommate might be able to answer, but I can't.

If I'm polite but hold back from an extended conversation or from solving her problem, she tries to interact with me more often. If I withdraw, she tries harder, then gives me presents. The only thing that seems to decrease her interactions with me is to literally not respond when she says things or to be borderline rude and patronizing ("I don't know whose stuff it is that you want moved. If I were in your situation, I would need to go around asking my roommates until I found whose it was. That's what I recommend you do. You can also text them if you don't want to go downstairs").

I feel terrible for her. I have a lot of experience being disoriented and disabled, needing help and support, and having other people ignore it, and it was traumatizing, and I hate being in a situation where I'm doing that to someone else. But my interactions with her leave me feeling pressured to parentify myself again and I'm spending an increasing amount of time coping with my emotional response.

Resources on boundaries often taken an approach of "it's totally okay for you to set whatever boundary you want no matter what!" But I can't turn off empathy like that, and it's also very difficult to follow advice from sources that don't recognize that circumstances matter enormously‚Äîfor example, I suspect some of the neglect I went through as a child was from my mother attempting to follow advice to set boundaries, and as an adult I've had bad experiences with "setting boundaries" translating into "not having to be around anyone who even mildly inconveniences you, plus you can abandon them in ways that make them targets for abuse".

So I'm struggling with feeling like resources for boundary-setting support, or at best ignore, the kinds of mistreatment that traumatized me. I don't want to be that kind of person, but I'm having trouble finding resources that thoughtfully engage with

can you do some exposure therapy? deliberately walk into being shamed in class? either way, we gotta do something to keep us from responding to being shamed, or from trying to preemptively address it, because the shaming will be picked based on what we didn't do.

Today I put forth some suggestions in Timezone designed to address cabs issues, on things to consider when evaluating new people. Other people there seem like me, so I thought they were reasonable, but everyone wants to do things in a Normal Way I guess. It felt like getting sucker-punched, and from a direction I didn't expect.

Yesterday I was super out of it due to mid cycle cramping, and today my head continues to feel all swollen. I took some robitussin-type nasal decongestants which helped a little, but all this stuff feels degenerative. It hugely helped my lower right hip issues‚Ä¶but honestly I think the problem is that I don't have enough space inside my skull to hold what I need. And it's just not going to get better until someone is willing to recognize and treat that.

I'm grieving a lot, and unmotivated, and decompensated by the move and not sure I'm actually able to pull myself out of it. I feel depressed and awful. I'm worried it's the lamotrigine reduction, or the craniofacial stuff, or starting Muldowney lowers. I'm really wanting a doctor I can trust to tell about this.

I'm seriously worried about the impending complete lack of privacy with the move. I shouldn't have tried to ask Michael to go in the closet, I should go in there instead so I can be by myself.

Thought about Mom: that weird sense of self consciously suspending playing a game when she had to set an actual boundary, and the total lack of self consciousness when she sided with other adults against us

Flipped out yesterday during our therapy time due to the rationalist medical research contracting thing with the rationalist I-won't-give-you-my-time-or-attention thing coming from that Elizabeth. I did find a way to politely tell her I was backing out, and told Michael my frustrations which salvaged some of my self-esteem. But I'm still super upset by it and it just feels phenomenally unfair that something that's supposed to be my culture has such an intense cultural norm of alienating people. I can say lots of words to prove that I'm being sympathetic and understanding toward her but I'm not going to bother.

Right side of head achy, in general sinuses continue to feel a little burning and inflamed.

Passover today.

She wants to know what she owes me and I don't want anything to do with the money.

Pain and burning appears to have been at least partly due to my shoulders

none of this is going to spread back to you. there may be distinct similarities with the same underlying causes in homeschooled children' experiences as in deaf children's experiences, but there is no common cause. that is not the point.

There are no venues for mutual understanding that include you. There are only venues specific to named, culturally validated marginalizations.

Friday was Passover. Went well, although I didn't feel as emotionally into it as I usually do. It felt very rote. But I also wasn't exhausted afterward.

9:50 AM

Yesterday I went to the new house and Allie and I organized the garage, partly at my insistence. I feel so much better. It's very important for me to be able to actively influence my physical environment, and to do so regularly, especially when the alternative is encroaching chaos. For obvious reasons (Mom trying to prevent me cleaning out the house / functioning; Michael trying to prevent me from organizing / cleaning / being able to function).

Today I am doing some stuff, some more packing,

I also got my head put back in. Feels like very top of vertebrae, push from back right to front left (diagonally) while lying down. Also, leaning back on ball and letting head hang.

Thinking about this I found on Reddit:

"as for spotting people, if you're a freeze/fawn, you're likely to repeat patterns, so you can use yourself as a quick way to gauge things. If you find yourself really wanting to please someone really quickly, or get close to them too fast, or you feel pressured around them, that's probably not a good sign. Anyone who makes you react the way you did to people who mistreated you in the past is suspect. Freeze/fawn is a response to danger, which is something that is being constantly scanned for and can be detected quicker than you're able to consciously realize, and your body will automatically protect you by using what worked in the past: freezing/fawning. So pay attention and be suspect of anyone who strongly triggers this reaction in you."

The carpet pad is delayed. "A week," Eric doesn't know if that means till Monday (i.e. a delay of a couple days) or if it means a week from when it was supposed to get there, which would require us to stay somewhere in between this house and the next, if the landlord won't let us stay a couple extra days.

I'm upset because I had finally locked into having a plan of action and now yet again another delay, and because it's going make moving in very disorganized. Having a couple days to move around stuff at the new house would have been hugely helpful.

Celeste tripped over clothes on the floor yesterday and hurt her knee. It swelled up badly enough they had to call an ambulance because she couldn't fit in the car. She can't remember that she can't get up from the couch on her own so she just assumes she can, so Allie slept downstairs on the floor next to her.

Michael commented to me that Allie just seamlessly shifts back and forth between caretaking one person and caretaking another.

She handles a million details while Eric just sits at the table and rebuffs attempts to get him to help her. Because he has work to do, and he just can't seem to process that maybe Allie has work to do too?? Maybe she also works a full-time job?? Maybe she has other things she might want to do than making up for his failure to contribute? Like, what the fuck.

He could at least actively help entertain the dog, but no, he's just kind of globally refusing responsibility while the women around him have to do everything.

It's really upsetting. I wish Allie would set more boundaries with her mom. I wish she would refuse to do some of this. I don't think it should be her responsibility to refuse but I still wish she would. But even more I wish that Eric would be, y'know, a father, a husband, and a son-in-law. And do his job instead of wanting everyone else to stop doing theirs.

I'm having a lot of trouble coping. I see Allie do this and think "oh, so that's why people think it's reasonable for me to things that are beyond my capacity as a matter of course - it's because other people can just do this."

I‚Äôm so angry. I would never mention this to a therapist because I'd get talk about boundaries and acceptance that would completely miss the fucking point.

At any rate, I'm going to keep working on packing my stuff and hope that it contributes to a feeling of control rather than a feeling of stagnation that everything is in boxes instead of going where it's supposed to.

Also, they're both ignoring the goddamn fucking dog and they were for months before the house search or Celeste moving in, despite having a 60-hours-a-week nanny. Now that he's taken a sharp downturn they're still not taking it seriously. I thought when he bit Lorena it would finally be a wakeup call, but no one is taking care of him.

I bet Eric sees him as Allie's dog therefore Allie's responsibility. Even though he did briefly manage to feel guilty (and want me to reassure him I think?) about having let Karl down.

Wonder if Allie's going to wind up caring for his mother, too.

Just overheard her talking to someone on the phone asking them to come out and help (I think a doctor's office). She was telling them that Celeste wasn‚Äôt' safe here on her own and she was worried Celeste would fall again and that things here were "a hot mess". I don't know the outcome but it sounded like they were saying the doctor couldn't see her till tomorrow, so Allie asked if she could see another doctor. Couldn't hear the outcome but I hope they set an appointment.

I am doing a good job not taking over Karl's care.

11:03am: overhearing that they didn't give her a wheelchair or a walker: she had to go to the pharmacy, buy one, and then help them put it together because they didn't know how to put one together.

I don't understand my head.

Being asked not to share things? But

Apparently we're trying to hide stuff from ourselves?

Yesterday I reorganized the garage and re-established staging areas.

I feel generally disappointed and bad and dull and unexcited. Low energy. Probably headache reemerging.

Ugh

Also carpet pad and Celeste falling and Allie having to shoulder the entire goddamn burden

Also. Just never moving forward. And when I do I don't feel it.

Paper was depressing too. There's just no evidential support for deaf schools. There's a chain of reasoning but it's not made explicit, and I don't trust anyone to not be lying to me.

I am abandoning hard of hearing people who are hurt by the deaf community by supporting something that works for "typical" deaf people without attention to those on the margins. Something that does not relaly

You know what? I just object to this whole goddamn assignment.

Last night: eyes were leaking when I lay down

Slept in room last night due to too hot in bedroom.

This morning: yes stuffy head. Took a phenylephrine/acetaminophen combo at 8:45am.

Feeling dumb and head swollen. Thick heavy mucus, pressure in left sinus.

9:39: I think I may have set neck back in. Also decongestant may be helping.

Feeling better now. Moving around uprigh tseems to help, and I had a big glass of green tea.

Salty Ana food yesterday and today.

Celeste had a panic attack last night. Sounded more like she was laughing, but not quite. She was in the bathroom. Allie spent a long time talking her through it. I went down and got Maya. Nobody thanked me later. Not thrilled with that.

Just feeling under overwhelming pressure to play into it, be nice to everyone, be supportive to Celeste, act toward her as though she wouldn't ramp up approaching me all the time. She's not doing it deliberately, probably; I also feel pressure to attribute everything to incapability on her part, even though the only excuses I have to not interact pretty much assume either someone's aggressing deliberately or it doesn't matter. I'm very, very tired of it.

I got super stressed today. Might be premenstrual stuff, might be from last night. Either way I feel like if I go downstairs everybody will be able to get ahold of me.

Finished the fucking paper. I think Michael is right; it's a bad assignment that reinforces students' existing beliefs. I resent it.

I simultaneously want to do a great job and learn a lot, and just be done.

Worried about the pantry shelves and getting in trouble, and also worried about clearin gthem out

Don't know best thing to do.

Overgaming less, but still playing.

Tilted head back and did craniofacial stuff to encourage draining. Seems to be helping. Ordered dandelion leaf tea which should come tomorrow.

Feel guilty and like crap

Tired of head feeling overstuffed and stuffy, wish I could talk to someone about it who would take responsibility

Feeling disconnected and stagnant and bored and abandoned.

Gamed some yesterday. Was very tired.

Tried my computer/reading glasses yesterday and was very surprised to discover that they were way way more comfortable and stable than ydistance ones - that my head is actually going upright with these instead of staying slightly tilted despite it increasing eye mismatch, like the others.

Put my headphones on because hearing Ana and others outside was constantly triggering

Julie was mad last night because someone did an academically better application essay and let her see it and she wanted me to tell her it was showboating and jargony. But I didn't. And then she wanted me to either reinforce her in in believeing she was a perfect fit or that she should give up.

Set head back into place on neck this morning. It sounded seriously awful. Right hip continues to sting but isn't horrifically cramping the same way.

Optometrist appointment today, which I think marks the last of the "can't settle into a routine yet" feeling for me. So glad to be here in this space. I set it up yesterday to have a privacy screen and it feels pretty comfy though needs some more decluttering.

My laptop is still losing battery very quickly, but I think it's at least not randomly shutting down anymore. That trick seems to have worked.

Still feeling kind of traumatized from yesterday Ana brought me coffee plant and I do not want. Can't talk to her she just interrupts. Hate her voice.

Celeste is going to be getting home health care help to try to train her into using the walker since she can't choose to do things or remember to do things.

Michael came back from his trip and is sleeping in the closet with the airpurifiers on at night and working outside in a tent during the day.

Feeling good this is me Fay

I like this I like it here

I will go to the garage and do thing sin the garage

On wed optometrist said that my eyes want to go in even more and she put 2 steps more in but htat if she gave them all they wantedI'd be cross-eyed and she wants my muscles to work at lesat some. I've been looking for exercise for convergence excess but they alo seem to be the other way around. I hope they figure out what is wrong with us. She gave me I think 1 or 2 steps more rotation.

Michael is clearly getting sick (sniffles/runny nose to the extreme) and yet he was happy and super unconcerned until I called him on it. I'm very frustrated because his hypochondria kicks in for when he's having symptoms other people can't see but as soon as he's having obvious symptoms he goes into denial??? I'm just so angry.

He tested negative for covid an hour ago so it's probably just a cold.

Went to Glenna nd Basia's last night. Did not ask Glenn questions about his job because of how Michael's friend sin the past just wanted to showboat. Also I am jealous. I wanted to have subject area knowledge of something smart. But then I had health problems. I may not have been a very good guest. Michael took up most of the slack but it was ok.

Basia is an artist. Their hoem is gorgeous. Michael noted that it was all Basia and none Glenn. I just think they will probably have problems because they moved in so fast. Basia already refused to put food away because Glenn would get annoyed if she did it wrong.

Headache on upper left base of skull.

Yesterday felt super sick headachy worsened by heat and refilling the emergency water. Got much better when I lay on my back and pressed upward against my side back sull bones. Tons of popping and movement and then everything felt less trapped. Hasn't gone away entirely but feels much better

Refilled eemrgency water yesterday.

Celeste is going to move into the assisted living facility ASAP apparently. Where she will presumably stop wearing a mask and using her walker which she is defaulting to doing all the time anyways.

Read The Guardian, news just makes me crash. Need to unsubscribe.

Can't take more trauma. Can barely take this good life and feel weak for that? Like such an emphasis on everybody has trauma but then I know other people's lives are not mostly like mine. They're just not. It is a lie when people say they are. They have some similarities in experiences but they are not the same in context, and context matters.

Disability spaces seem triggering to me now

Too much "yay" type stuff going on

Allie has moved Celeste to the nursing home. Like everything else, this has been a clusterfuck. Repeated failures of responsibility on the part of nearly every provider she talks to. She is in the place again and again of having to be the coordinator of her mother's care, as well as the provider of her mother's care, and it is a nightmare. I cannot imagine doing it. Someone needs to jump in and help her but some of what she is doing is just too voluntary?? She will nto let go or say no.

I want her to leave Celeste alone. I want her to give up and let go. I want her to ask Celeste what Celeste wants. And then proceed like that. Not to exert control over everything. The only up side is that assisted living almost has to be more freeing for Celeste and maybe she won't want to move back here.

Everyone falling down on her feels very collapse of civilization but also very NT, everyone ascribing NT-ness to Celeste and assumign she can/will do things. Even Allie does not adjust enough to know that Celeste cannot and will not refrain from doing antyhing.

Why did she not know. Does she not know this is what other people are like. So much advice premised on being able to pre-control others, premised on others being willing to notice and respond and desire to support your needs, but they are not. And I am angry at the absolute persistent refusal of people to recognize this and refusal to set absolute boundaries. Just an endless series of wheedles and compromises.

Why does nobody understand powerlessness? Especially in the context of ultimate responsibility.

I feel nauseated and dizzy and stmach cramping and before these glasses I was mostly just in pain and cramping not the dizzy

Or was I

Either way I feel xhausted, like I've used up the supply of not feeling dizzy in my life and now it won't come back

Yesterday had a cramped part right sideo f head had to massage it cilck it backinto place nad then I felt stable

Nauseated dizzy

From using eyes maybe? Up close? Hard to tell

So sleepy so tired

Missed melotonin last night I thhnk, found it on bedroomn floor

So tired

Horribly dizzy and nauseated. Turned out to be jaw and neck muscles clenching up. They needed a LOT of work.

Wrote:

People who cannot and do not realize how horrible it is for someone to persistently override my boundaries.

People who do not listen when I say the same thing over and over again: my mother deprived me of critical interactions needed for early childhood development, then tried to verbally wishful-think me into being the person I would have been without those interactions by telling me I already was. It was desperately important to her that I be successful and have lots of friends - but she did not provide the normal kinds of support that a normal upbringing would have given for that, and then

It's the not listening that prevents me from moving forward. This was a serious issue! But it gets entirely blown off, including by therapists whose job it is to listen. And it has been blown off that way for literal decades, by people who truly do not understand that it was actually a crime against a small child. They don't provide the sympathy they should: "It was horrible of her to do that to you. You did not deserve that and did not choose it. No one should have allowed that to happen. It was horrible that she ensured that she would have such control over your life, and that she used a system that has resulted in you being continually punished for her mistakes over and over and over and over for decades and \*everyone blaming you for her mistakes\*. It was horrible that she set it up in such a way that all the apparent escape routes were just making everything worse. It was horrible that she set it up so that the only actual escape consisted of robbing you of all agency. It's horrible that she set it up so that \*taking agency, the thing you would be constantly advised to do as an adult,\* made things worse. She literally created a situation where \*being prosocial would result in constant punishment\* and then she made you value being prosocial. She got what she wanted and let you take the punishment in her place.

It is a crime against a small child to ensure they do not have access to the outside. She committed a crime against you, and committed crimes through you by failing to provide the complex ability to respond to others that you needed. She set up a mental maze where when you tried to do the right thing over and over it was actually the wrong thing.

She hurt those people. You were doing your best. She fucked them up. You don't have to bear that legacy anymore. You can blame your mother when fucked up shit happens. She programmed you to act like her and gave you no access to other ways of being, and programmed in a worldview that made all the bad stuff seem like the obviously right thing to do. It was \*her responsibility\* to make sure you could tell when things were overwhelming and that you had options and could stand up for yourself in any way other than being angry.

The absolute failure of psychotherapists to recognize that what she did was not a light cute thing doesn't help. Homeschooling should ALWAYS be a red flag.

Now you have to reinforce boundaries that you shouldn't need to have. If she'd helped you recognize boundaries when you were a kid you wouldn't have sacrificed yourself over and over. If she had made it about your needs instead of about whether you were a good person or not then you wouldn't have RSD.

If she hadn't focused so fuckign much on other people's feelings then you might actually be able to value your goals and to navigate calmly with other people. If she'd taught you to focus on yourself and on outcomes instead of being hypersensitive to what other people thought of you then you wouldn't have this problem.

She absolutely failed to focus on on your wellbeing and to help you focus on it. She ensured you would be unable to protect yourself. She made you look terrible. You did not do those things. She did.

She made a little avatar of herself who would be both less able to be effective than she was and more harmed by being ineffective and she perpetuated those things on the world.

She did it. She hurt you. She made you attach. Not you. She makes you spill too much to other people, she made you unable to call a halt or stop wandering in mental circles. She made sure you were out of touch.

And she could have eliminated a shocking amount of that by \*putting you in school\*. And she could have eliminated an enormous amount more by supporting you while you were in school! She could have done that! She had the ability to do it, she just didn't want to!

And it is \*even worse\* that none of the psychotherapists you have seen have instantly recognized this as child neglect, including when you \*told them\*. Their good sense goes out the fucking window when they get a chance to sympathize with a parent doing a Good Liberal Parent Thing and protecting her children from the Evils of School!

Can you start again without the legacy of her?

Stuff like:

\- say no faster and without guilt

\- ignore when people are marked as "special" - note that they may be hostile and take that as info and as reason to not try to befriend them. Do not attempt to befriend "special" people. Acknowledge that most people won't want to talk to you.

\- acknowledge that most people will try to give you bad advice, and that getting good advice would require giving them so much detail it enforces an inappropriately close relationship. I don't have a good answer for what to do when you have to follow their advice, but I do want you to stop approaching people.

\- this Deaf thing is not working out. It hits too many of your boundaries.

\- I don't know if you'll ever be able to work. I'm sorry. I know that's really disappointing. She did fuck you up, quite badly.

\- Most people are not Ana. Even most people you've worked with are nowhere near that horrible, with rare exceptions.

\- They could have fired her and gotten another nanny. At any point.

\- They will not set boundaries for you.

1\. You need to see that you will protect yourself.

2\. When you protect yourself, you do not need to yell at yourself.

3\. Withdrawing is a valid form of protecting yourself.

I need a name for this specific tendency ("all bad things are in the past! anything else is just a misunderstanding!").

While the \*schema\* of DNMS seems accurate, the approach seems toxic as fuck.

Protection is about \*action\*. It is about not forcing yourself into pain to prove a point.

Nurturing is about \*action\*. It is about doing things that will make you feel better. It is about glasses and healthcare and pain reduction. It is not about talking. It is not about using someone else's distress to reinforce a connective bond with them. It is about advocating for them \*to other people\*.

Lack of empathy is about \*action\*. It is about refusing a bid to care for someone else. It is about telling them yes, I have the resources, and I will not give them. It is about asserting power.

Sometimes standing up for yourself means \*choosing to disregard others as unimportant\*.

Headache yesterday and mild headache still today. Probably from doing the head press against pillow too hard and putting it out of place. Need to be super careful with that.

More ongoing dull headache probably from trying pressing head into pillow I don't know wtf I was thinking

I'm pretty tired and achy and slugghish and I also feel pretty nauseated.

Yesterday was mid cycle day.

Still headache but not as bad

Uggggh

Something clearly out of place

Seemed to be at base of neck though?

Nauseated

Up side down on ball with head dangling seemed to help a little

Feeling a little better but still very head stuffy. Like swollen hot won't drain. Could it be an actual infection? Not a new one, something chronic. Going to see if caffeine helps.

Tried DMSO + magnesium which I hope will continue helping.

Left back sinus is oozing I guess. Head feels somewhat better, maybe not back in palce but less bad. Magnesium and DMSO was probably a good idea.

Going to attempt a day of doing many things

Walked a long way yesterday (over 10k steps total) and 2 miles this morning.

Feeling better. Hard time sleeping last night though. Heard buzzing notification 3x and woke Michael up but then he didn't have his watch on (it was in the office) and it apparently wasn't his phone. My phone and ipad were both on do not disturb. So I don't know what it was.

Head hurt more lying down last night after a while, body hurt. Something out of place. Don't know what causes it. Would like to find out. Is it moving head around? Could be, because I seem to feel best when I don't have to move or bend my head for a long time, like out on a walk.

Anyway, no more Muldowney exercises for me - I think I'm going to give them up.

Felt awful. Awful awful

Michael did not support he wanted to take sides validate me

Horrible all day. Tried EBT. Then lay down and apparently right shoulder was out??

\-\-\-\-

The situation is that I'm immensely distressed about writing. I tried to write, was stuck endlessly, then talked to Michael about it and he wanted to reinforce my self-esteem instead of acknowledging that I was having skill issues. I also saw a reply to Robbin this morning in my inbox from the class that indicated that someone else has problems with her, and it made me flash back on her comment. I'm tired, hot, and physically uncomfortable; the right side of my head feels swollen.

What I am most stressed about is that my head hurts, I'm not doing anything, and I want to cry.

I feel angry that I have tried \*so hard\* to work out these problems, and it has resulted in not only a lack of help but other people creating more problems for me.

I can't stand it that this keeps happening to me, I keep feeling awful and hot and sick.

I HATE it that Margie didn't just notice and tell her to stop. I hate it that I'm being made responsible AND BLAMED BY MARGIE for having been affected by feedback in a class that is literally all about feedback.

I feel sad that I can't just do this. That I am still struggling with the same issues over and over and that the advice I get does not help. I am sad that I tried to write and my characters were like strangers to me. I am sad that it hurts so much. I am sad that my jaw hurts. I am angry that I cannot get help for it.

I feel afraid that it will never end. That people are going to keep hurting me and never stop and that the goal really is to get rid of me, not to have me become a better writer. I am afraid that I will be purposefully traumatized and pushed out of everywhere in an effort to keep me maximally nonfunctional.

I feel guilty that... \[Kind of uncomfortable that this comes around to self-blame at the end, like every single goddamn thing. Especially when I feel guilty about things that \*aren't under my control or are things I do for very good reasons\*.\]

I feel guilty that I can't just do it all anyway and ignore my feelings.

OF COURSE I would try to do it anyway, because I was taught that if I didn't I wouldn't deserve anything. OF COURSE I would try to ignore my feelings, because everyone else does! Why wouldn't I? I get my protection from \*being able to ignore my feelings\*, because my feelings are dangerous to other people.

I cannot get my protection from ignoring my feelings. I cannot get my protection from ignoring my feelings. I cannot get my protection from ignoring my feelings.

I can get my protection from NOT ENGAGING IN CRITIQUE GROUPS WITH PEOPLE I DON'T TRUST. I am upset about this because it's the primary kind to socialization I have access to! I'm upset because I let

I DON'T KNOW WHERE I CAN GET PROTECTION FROM. IT'S A GENUINE PROBLEM NOT ONE I FUCKING MAD EUP

Yesterday went quite well. Today may too. Looks like I'll skip jury duty. Fingers crossed.

EBT seems good? And I read some books.

I put my skull back into place this morning. It was horribly loud and grindy but I felt so much better afterward. (Pressing on right back of skull in early morning, pressing forward)

Let myself stay in bed a couple hours because felt bluh. But did ultimately gte a lot done.

Went for a walk and Megynn and ? Others we all worked on the novel, Aimee's first scene with Madison and her scene at the welcoming ceremony. Decided she should meet the performance guy and impress him.

Thought: therapists won't allow me the ability to withhold myself or make choices. They won't give me the option to withdraw because they want to force a relationship.

Feeling a little overwhelmed and disorganized. Slept better at least. Good solid dream, relaxing.

Took more ibuprofen yesterday and today. Might be going to get period? Hope so.

Working on taking more walks and having enough food, especially in afternoons.

Summary of morning walk: Rain is quite angry that we undo her work and that's why she doesn't stand up for us. Someone also suggested that we maybe don't have the singlet or single headmate who can just set boundaries and be the strong one, and that perhaps we can all come together to do that. Outcome is that we will try to put selves first, prioritize inside children (and not elevate outsiders to the status of inside children), and that we will also refuse to take blame when we cannot do that, because blaming ourselves for thigns we can't do or don't know we can't do is abusive. Rain approves.

Headachy today and stomachachy but took an ibuprofen and just kind of slid in to doing things. Amazing.

Walk yesterday was helpful. Imagined out 3 scenes.

Tummy ouchy. Maybe guacamole? It did burn my mouth.

Yesterday = walked outside, worked on emotions around fanfic and clenching up, Megynn led an opening of water channels to let flow. People bobbed around in the water.

I wonder if the last coulpe days could have been a reaction to the guacamole.

Took some famotidine and also some ibuprofen
