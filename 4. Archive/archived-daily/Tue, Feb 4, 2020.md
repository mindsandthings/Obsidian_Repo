Achy today. (I mean, I'm still doing only 30mg 2x/day of mestinon because I'm running low, so that almost certainly contributes.) Back of head/base of neck ache too. 

I had to do a whole 0.125 clonazepam last night, probably because my kindle wouldn't charge and I read my phone instead, which was not the best thing to do for my sleep.
