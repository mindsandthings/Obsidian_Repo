GLASSES YESTERDAY. 

They weren't as difficult at first as I'd expected. I am getting some warping for reading with further away, and stuff past the focus range feels unusually blurry. 

The one tight thing at the back right of my head is not gone but it is greatly reduced. 

I was slow getting started but it hasn't been a huge deal. I feel pretty calm about it. 

I am a little achy and last night I did feel a little bit of pain but I also feel unusually relaxed. 

Meeting with Marvin person today for her user interview. 

Yesterday Larissa Pasut had to reschedule so my appointment is today instead. 

Maya has a unicorn outfit. It's so cute.
