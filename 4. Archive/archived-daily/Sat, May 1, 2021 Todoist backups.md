* 
Remember not to make suggestions or have opinions about how groups operate, especially when there are people from marginalized groups involved. Do not volunteer to do things; do not contribute more than the minimum; do not step in; do not be visible. If someone in power invites you to, distrust them, especially if it seems like they have the power to grant it. Your goal is to be one of the faceless masses. Your fawn response actively endangers you. Your cooperation response actively endangers you. Your instinct to connect actively endangers you.

maybe I don't have to do anything about self-esteem. maybe that really doesn't matter, because these people aren't worth my maintaining a relationship with them. they're not worth my respect. maybe they're just where I am right now before I move on to something else.

* 
Stop sharing personal distress stuff about autism. Stop doing in Slack and stop doing it in the novel and in the footnotes. It suggests that you are competing for status as a marginalized person and trying to use trauma to get out of punishment. It also makes the whole place less comfortable to be.

M is a bully whom you have seen bully people before; you are not obligated to take her in good faith. When she agresses, say: "I'm not sure that sits completely right with me. I'll think about it and get back to you." PQ generally: Remember, hon, they're kind of intolerant, and they receive points for weaponizing the framework against you in order to appear more victimized. There are good people in there, but the framework has set up being a good person in a way that can harm you.
