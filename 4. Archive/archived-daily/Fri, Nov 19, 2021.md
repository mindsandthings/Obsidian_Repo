Yesterday was in pain but also super sleepy and also just out of it, unable to imagine doing things. Assume must have been period? 

Today Achy lower body but not as out of it but still rested all morning not great idk I feel a mess. 

TBH, this was a hell of a week. I wound up doing everything to address my increasing headache - ibuprofen 3x/day for a week, glasses, wearing hearing aids on pink noise to help straighten head, everything - and eventually it went out. Possibly because the problem was all something else? I don't know if it was. Who knows. I'm inevitably drained when the pain management doesn't successfully let me keep my routine.
