Chiropractor yesterday. Helpful. PM I lay on front and I think some of the neck adjustment went away? But also I didn't get a huge headache that night. 

Today I'm kind of achy around the middle again. feeling clenched up on the right.

Also he found a knot on my upper right side ribcage that helped a lot. I think that was what was creating the problem that felt like it was inside my uppermost chest.
