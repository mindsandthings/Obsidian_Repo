Part of the thing making me feel bad is flopping forward tummy while sticking butt out and chest forward. Curving both butt and chest feels better. I think this is an abdominal weakness issue. I have started doing callanetics stomach exercises today. 

Eventful day - talked to Sandra my teacher ASL teacher about possible jobs. She seemed to think research support would be a good job; was cautious about making videos. Research support will have an issue of me having kind of burned bridges a while ago. I may talk with Michael about it. 

Had to go back on like 1/16th of atenolol every other day. Will do that for another week and then stop.
