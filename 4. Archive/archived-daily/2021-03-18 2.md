Wow.
I mean, I expected the block, but… I will never understand this thing where anti racist activists decide white people are the only people or the worst people who misuse our privilege, as though those sorts of failure modes aren’t really common when power dynamics are lopsided in any way.
It’s just… weird to me. No one is saying that POC don’t have it extremely bad. We’re just saying so do other groups (and that POC who are multiply marginalized therefore might well have it worse than able bodied cis straight NT-passing men of color.)
Why is it taboo to say this about POC, but EXPECTED to acknowledge it about disabled people, gay people, trans people, nonChristians, etc?
Is it just that the white fragility school of thought is the one currently raking in the $$$?
(Also, I STILL can’t shake the feeling that the image these people have in their heads of “white women” is not a gnc person like me, but rather a “Karen”—someone who weaponizes her white NT middle class probably straight FEMININITY in a particular way, that those of us not deemed feminine or only sometimes deemed feminine *may* be able to access, or may only be able to access some of the time. Can we talk about that part?)
Why is it that as soon as a white person, regardless of how marginalized they are or how violent it is/was, says “it’s complicated” and takes issue with words like “only,” that itself is taken as derailing? 
I feel like it’s 2005 again. Guess I’ll go outside?

It sounds like op has been hella traumatized by white people especially women and (with their tumblr saying they’re 20) i’m not sure they’ve really had the space to work on processing all those feelings and issues or even access to all those resources.
