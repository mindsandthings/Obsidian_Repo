Acetazolamide? y, 1/8 at 9:22am

Went to bed on time? y

Clonazepam last night? y

Pain management for today? nerve glides

Lower back is painful, though mid back is okay. Head and back top of neck feel swollen. I really want this to not be an acetazolamide issue but it may be. I also did not drink enough water over the whole day yesterday.
