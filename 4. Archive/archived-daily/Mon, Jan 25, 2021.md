DMSO? n
Clonazepam? n
(prev night)

Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today? 


Have raised melatonin back up to 1.5 mg - I had been breaking 3's in half for a long time and I think at some point I just sort of forgot. So I should try to keep doing that. 

Have been stretching out chest on ball and it seems to do a huge amount to open up and make neck etc hurt less. I don't think it worked as well before doing all the TOS trigger points but it does now.
