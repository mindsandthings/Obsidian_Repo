A bit achy especially after ASL chat. My brain hurt then because too many delays and filling in the blanks. 


Discord guy stuff=
1. Snack, rest, meds
4. ***Arsenic chat schedule - review, TJ changed
Cincy chili? ask M where TVP is. or cowboy caviar
2. Refill meds
3. stretches, Muldowney protocol
4. WHY WON'T THIS SAVE MY WINDOW CONFIGURATION

### ~~Pay credit card~~
### ~~Ask E if needs me to handle chat~~
