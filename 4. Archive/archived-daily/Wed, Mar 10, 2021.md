Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today? 

Did Muldowney lowers for the first time in a week(?) and I didn't feel pain over it. Only did 2 minutes but still. I think sometimes 2 days is not enough to recover.

Trying new "medium" hearing aid domes but I think they are a little too large for my left ear unfortunately. And might be making things feel underwater-is.
