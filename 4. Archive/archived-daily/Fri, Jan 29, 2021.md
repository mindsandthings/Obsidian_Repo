(prev night)

Went to bed on time? 

Pain management for today? 

Raised melatonin up to 1.5mg from 1mg and that seems to put me to sleep effectively. 

Last night first some discomfort and then clicked the base of my skull back into place (the left side this time: around to the back) and then my upper left sinus just produced a ton of sticky mucus. I DMSO'd it last night before bed, no obvious immediate changes and it only clear it out for breathing for about 20 minutes, but this morning I feel mostly okay sinus wise.

Have laid on ball and stretching mid and mid-lower back seems to help with stuckness of mid-right-back and sternum. 

Driopped mestonon to 30x 1/day on Sun and seems to be ok so far.
