Period today. Stomach cramping. Didn't notice it the last couple days - maybe that means the glasses have reduced my premenstrual cramping!!

Carrying Maya is fun but gives me backaches now. 

ASL 102 exam coming up. More nervous about it than I was earlier. Reminding self to relax and let signer come through.
