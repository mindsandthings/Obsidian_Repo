Had serious headache and mucus/stuffy head last night after looking up at crossword puzzle Michael was broadcasting to the TV. Took caffeine and dandelion leaf tea this morning and felt vastly better and more able to do things.

S went on a twitter rant:

https://twitter.com/sqiouyilu/status/1560229177915166720?s=20&t=uooZFWPWwKwzix8tlHGK9g

I posted this to the PubQ S channel:

A big chunk of S's thread follows the topics and structure of my (much more positive) 2016 blog post on Clarion West and accessibility, but reframing everything I covered in the most negative and personal way possible.[10:59](https://pubq.slack.com/archives/C3MHNDR6U/p1661018388743179)SL Huang linked to that post in a twitter thread the day before and I'm guessing S reread it and live tweeted a rant.[11:02](https://pubq.slack.com/archives/C3MHNDR6U/p1661018530974079)It's an older post and does not cover the new location or new workshop structure, but I'm going to repost it here since my focus was on accurately portraying accessibility-relevant features of CW at the time it was written (edit: and I think S's thread mixes stuff that happened and stuff that didn't in a very misleading way): https://elizabethbartmess.com/deciding-whether-to-attend-clarion-west-for-disabled-writers/ (edited) [11:02](https://pubq.slack.com/archives/C3MHNDR6U/p1661018547910839)(Admittedly, the part about our class not having much drama didn't age as well as I wish it had)[11:02](https://pubq.slack.com/archives/C3MHNDR6U/p1661018561917969)I need to update the link to the CW faq in that post. Here's the updated link: https://www.clarionwest.org/programs/summerworkshop/faq/

thing is, in the latter part of S's thread they correctly identified that the diversity committee focused exclusively on BIPOC issues. they got that from the actual committee's blog post.

also in SL Huang's tweet thread they noted that they had to cut accessibility stuff. here's their private pubq post to the businessy_tw-publishing channel mentioning that: [SL Huang is only sometimes here](https://app.slack.com/team/U1L7X412Q) [3 days ago](https://pubq.slack.com/archives/CP70CDG68/p1660755013423689?thread_ts=1660754409.365039&cid=CP70CDG68)
I want to add in particular bc of the trend of the conversation here -- I had to cut SO MUCH, so if there's something you're disappointed not to see, I'm sorry! (the first draft I turned in was twice this length) I wanted to make mention of that bc much of the in-channel conversation here was about accessibility, which initially I did a whole page on but my editor and I agreed that since it wasn't the article's focus I wasn't doing it justice in the "this really needs its own article" sense ![:disappointed:](../../_resources/e576527373e598afb7fb6bb6a9d72fe7) ![:sweat:](../../_resources/c2551ab4de993767099eabb4f3469a3d) It's such an important issue and I wish I had been able to do it justice and I'm sorry I wasn't, and I deeply appreciate everything people shared with me on that.

\-\-\-

It's simultaneously validating and distressing to see that actually confirmed. I have avoided mentioning that part of the thread at all. but if I did my comment would be "S isn't making a real challenge or trying to get broader engagement; if they were, they wouldn't have said 'CW is doing just fine with race but fucking up disability', because no one cares about disability.

I'm thinking about what to say if someone asks me about it but the thing is...I doubt anyone will ask me about it, or even think it's worthy of mention that S is right. So thanks, S; you've ensure that people are now even less likely to bring that up.

I hope it will all come out someday and people will be sympathetic but I can't imagine that happening any time soon. and people will hate me for it.

Wish I could bring up the Clarion West slack channels on identity getting deleted except for the alumni and the BIPOC ones. Wish I could mention my theory that the Suzanna Palumbo/Dave Ring-driven horrible PubQ policy idea happened around the same time and that there must have been some actual fucking coordination in some other fucking slack.

Like, there must have been even more stuff going on other places that I didn't hear about. And I just really hope some of it will come out someday.

got mad at eric boaut not doing  ountertop cleaning today maybe shouldn't have feel bad about it

also lots of cramping, feel sick and slow

got indexing results back though, did great

Identification of strengths:

1\. Input: grabbed a bunch of kindle samples on mystery writing plotting books

2\. Strategic: plotting for mystery book;

3\. Learner: wanting to take another indexing class even though I don't think it's a viable career option for me

4\. Intellection:

5\. Responsibility: guilt guilt guilt beat self up

7:28pm: on phone, looked down then up and now I have an oval blind spot in my vision, with a lot of little cracked geometric straight interior lines. It's not quite in the center - maybe left eye center? If I look at the "R" in center the left edge shows up over the "r" in "cracked". If I look at the "U" in "up" on the line above it starts about at the "u" in"up" on tne line below.

7:36pm: It's been getting much bigger. 

7:39pm: it's almost as tall as my monitor now. 

wonder if it's related to having drunk yesterday

7:49pm: it's all the way at the edges and the lights are fading

I took some ibuprofen

earlier today I was just very sluggish and felt awful

had 2 ounches of coffee about 7 hours earlier

changed aligner that morning

7:53: the scintillating is gone and my vision is mostly normal

7:59pm: vision still feels slightly off

8:09 I'm reasonable sure I'm back to normal by now

neck started being slightly stiff around 8

Went for a walk. Now I can feel my sinuses draining. 

Left eye feels a little achy and maybe a little blank, though it was much mor epresent last night after the scotoma. 

Today have so much more energy. Woke up feeling well rested and normal.
