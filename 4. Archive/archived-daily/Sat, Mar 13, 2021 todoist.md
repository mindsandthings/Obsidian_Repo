which is: I take notes each chapter as I'm reading, for a long piece, and then I write up a few paragraphs each of a report, starting with "What it's about / what happened" (useful 'cause if I got that wrong, that tells you something about how to take the feedback bit), "What worked well", "What didn't quite work", "Suggestions" (if wanted, and sectioned out so they can be discarded if needed), and then a summary of my overall response.

Remember not to make suggestions or have opinions about how groups operate, especially when there are people from marginalized groups involved. Do not volunteer to do things; do not contribute more than the minimum; do not step in; do not be visible. If someone in power invites you to, distrust them, especially if it seems like they have the power to grant it. Your goal is to be one of the faceless masses. Your fawn response actively endangers you. Your cooperation response actively endangers you. Your instinct to connect actively endangers you.

Tomorrow




	* 

never EVER EVER do that again. NEVER. do not try to suggest anything restricting anyone from a minority group

Thursday




	* 

DO NOT BLOG. DO NOT WRITE ON TUMBLR. DO NOT TALK ABOUT IT.

Tomorrow




	* 

STOP WINNING THINGS. STOP COMPETING. STOP SHOWING OFF. STOP STANDING OUT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THOSE THINGS. THEY WILL ALIENATE OTHER PEOPLE AND YOU WILL BE A BAD PERSON.

Tomorrow




	* 

I need a policy of ZERO responses to critique. The only response is to say "thanks, that's very helpful." I can follow up later by email if I have to, but I don't owe them an explanation. they're nothing to me.

Tomorrow

	* 

STOP SUGGESTING STUFF

Tomorrow

	* 

I am *only* in this group for what I can get for it for the novel. Not for the people.

Tomorrow

	* 

maybe I don't have to do anything about self-esteem. maybe that really doesn't matter, because these people aren't worth my maintaining a relationship with them. they're not worth my respect. maybe they're just where I am right now before I move on to something else.

Tomorrow

	* 

Stop sharing personal distress stuff about autism. Stop doing in Slack and stop doing it in the novel and in the footnotes. It suggests that you are competing for status as a marginalized person and trying to use trauma to get out of punishment. It also makes the whole place less comfortable to be.

Tomorrow

	* 

Send chapters to beta-readers and sensitivity readers

Each time you start a new venture: lay out conditions under which it is acceptable to contribute. Then, stick to those. If they work badly, adjust later, but don't adjust on the fly.

Tomorrow

	* 

You are extremely overcommitted, and you cannot afford to spend extra time on something with a hint of a reward. You must focus on your chapters, the stuff for Ada, physical pain, and keeping the house clean.

Tomorrow

	* 

we need a genuine process of thinking over things before we send them out, and of alerting to our sense that we're being helpful, because being helpful results in us widening the discrepancy between ourselves and other people.

Tomorrow

	* 

Also, remember that people who want you to do things on hard copy are *obsessed* with it. It's a religious point for them. Don't go digital.

Tomorrow

	* 

Don't post suggestions that are helpful to teachers. DOn't be helpful. KNOW. YOUR. PLACE.

Tomorrow

	* 

Seriously, tune it down. You could have a friend but you'll scare her off and make her feel bad about herself.

Tomorrow

	* 

I set a challenge for you: don't show off. At all. You are *not supposed to be the best*. You are *not supposed to be visibly good*. You are supposed to be stable, independent, and happy.

Tomorrow

	* 

The best way to think about this is: you need to match other people's indifference.

Tomorrow

	* 

Other people need to have a perception that they are in CONTROL. Ask yourself: will this make someone feel like they are losing control of the situation? Like their expectations aren't accurate or reliable? You don't want to do that to people.

Tomorrow

	* 

if you feel like you are showing off, that is the point at which to stop. you have no need to show off.

	* 

M is a bully whom you have seen bully people before; you are not obligated to take her in good faith. When she agresses, say: "I'm not sure that sits completely right with me. I'll think about it and get back to you." PQ generally: Remember, hon, they're kind of intolerant, and they receive points for weaponizing the framework against you in order to appear more victimized. There are good people in there, but the framework has set up being a good person in a way that can harm you.

May 10

My favorite way to make Brussels sprouts...marinated overnight! In a gallon size zip bag combine juice of 1 lemon, 1 T olive oil, pepper, paprika and garlic salt. Add in Brussels (cut in half or quartered), seal bag and toss around until well coated. Refrigerate overnight. When ready to roast, preheat oven to 400, place Brussels on baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes. Feel free to eat the entire pan, they are that good!
