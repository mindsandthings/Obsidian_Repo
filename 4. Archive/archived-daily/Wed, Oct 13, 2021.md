Hoping the Amazon package is my glasses.

Woke up at 4:45am for no apparent reason. Read about Default Mode Network and task-positive network(?). Definitely my problem. Default Mode Network is either overactive or super uncomfortable and activating task network balances it. Not 100% sure I understand the relationship between the two though. 

Played with Maya a bit when she woke up. Was adorable. Did worry about Eric possibly feeling I was intruding / too much a focus of attention. 

Elizabeth: not today
Chant: yes
Ivvy: for baby
