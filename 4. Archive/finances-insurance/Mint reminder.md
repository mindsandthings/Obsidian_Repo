# Mint reminder

Mint tasks for both of us:  
* Amazon store card payments need to be renamed and categorized as "credit card payment" -- this one is major; the other tasks are less critical.  

* Make sure cash expenses are being faithfully recorded.  

* Categorize Amazon purchases as they come in. Anything under $20 we can let slide.  

* For presents, use "gift". For donations, use "charity". Never use "gifts and donations".  

* Periodically check income and make sure venmo / paypal is categorized with the expense it's paying us back for.  

* Figure out how Mint is handling ATM withdrawals.  


Also: Going forward, please edit donations so that the name of the recipient is in the title (they're not all "Facebook donation" and "ppgf gfm ppgf"). Then I can go back and check which ones are tax deductible. I did that for this year and saved ~$100.
