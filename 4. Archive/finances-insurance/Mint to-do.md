# Mint to-do

Mint tasks for both of us:  
* Amazon store card payments need to be renamed and categorized as "credit card payment" -- this one is major; the other tasks are less critical.  

* Make sure cash expenses are being faithfully recorded.  

* Categorize Amazon purchases as they come in. Anything under $20 we can let slide.  

* For presents, use "gift". For donations, use "charity". Never use "gifts and donations".  

* Periodically check income and make sure venmo / paypal is categorized with the expense it's paying us back for.  

* Figure out how Mint is handling ATM withdrawals.
