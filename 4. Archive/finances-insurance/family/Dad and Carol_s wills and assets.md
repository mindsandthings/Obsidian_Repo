### to me, julie


Liz, Julia,

We've now got our wills etc complete, and the documents are attached as two big (10+14MB) files, one for me, one for Carol.

The original legal hard copies for all this are stored in a fire/water proof lockbox under the roll-top desk in our house. There's a smal key (square black plastic handle) in the paperclip section of the white plastic drawer organizer in the center drawer of the roll-top desk, and one hung about a foot lower than the usual backup house key place in the garage. This will have only the paperwork in it, and nothing of real value, but needs to be locked for fire-proofness.

There is a copy of all this paperwork in my office at the Chem department, top drawer of the nearest file cabinet to my desk, in a leather folder.

The other paperwork is the agreement letter from Julia about the advance on her inheritance against the nursing school loan. We;'ve made an equivalent offer to Tim about getting through Community College or a trade school, and should that happen, the paperwork will be there as well.

I will also put a couple pages of accounts/passwords in there. Some work accounts noted there to change passwords several times a year, but the household accounts should be stable.

Current $:

All of our immediate $ are in the UT Federal Credit Union (UTFCU), acct 1299570 (Joint with Carol). Carol’s are there as 3888920 (joint with me).
On my account there, there is Regular Shares (=savings), Cookie Jar (savings for vacations), Economy Checking (checking, and my debit card (silver in my wallet, last digits 0214) goes to this) and Money Market (savings with interest, no withdrawal penalty, but you have to actually do the transfers yourself).

Credit Card: MasterCard with Bank of America (sponsored by Amer. Chem. Soc; it’s the one in my wallet with the Periodic Table background) ends in 6211

Autopay on my UTFCU checking:
KUB/ Knoxville Utitlities Board) for elec/water.
Comcast (internet/TV)
Verizon: on Carol’s UTFCU account

Autopay on the debit card (need to change if the debit card changes):
Waste Connections (quarterly Mar/Jun//Sept/Dec) every Monday trash pickup; alternate Tuesdays recycling pickup (the bin with the pink sticker on iT)

Not autopay:
Insurance: both House and auto are with Metlife (top file drawer). Payments due Mar/Sep on autos; Oct on the house.
Rural Metro: fire insurance $322 in March each year. Do it; it’s worth it (ca. $10K to fight a house fire if you don’t)
Property tax: bill appears in fall of the year; needs to be paid by check by Feb of next year. Ca $901 at the moment.
TIAA life ins: until I turn 70 (11 Nov 2018), I have $100K in basic life insurance. It goes away after that. I have one more payment due on this in Mar 2018 of ca. $3500… and then I get ca. $2700 back in interest several weeks later.

The Big $$$$$
In the long run, there’s about $800K or more in play, divided by the 4 inheritors. The final amount depends on what Carol and I need to spend on medical stuff in our retirement. This is from:
(1)     my TIAA retirement funds (half from me, half from my IU/UTK salary), total ca. $800K. There’d be a lot more, save that Natalie got half of what I stashed away 1977-2002 in the divorce, so it’s pinto-beans-and-cornbread for me as a result.
(2)      About $350K from my Dad (finalized as of Sept 2017).

Of that $800K from the work TIAA-CREF retirement: half is going into an annuity.  The capital of this will go away when we die, but the income (plus Soc.Security) will give us roughly the same as our pre-retirement income – less the extra medical insurance costs.
The other half is in various investments with TIAA-CREF. Because this was not taxed on original acquisition over the years, I am required to withdraw some amount [periodically. I’m still checking on that timing and amount with TIAA-CREF, and you will need to pay tax on it when you inherit.

The money from Dad’s estate has already been taxed. The bulk of it has gone into a TIAA life insurance policy – as an investment. This accrues interested and is cashable at any time by us. The insurance aspect doesn’t pay until both Carol and I die. There’s a folder (“TIAA Life Ins – new”) in the top file drawer. If in the future we do cash this out, I’ll let everyone know.

Finally, as noted above under the UTFCU information, some of the inheritance from Dad is now in local savings or Money Market accounts (tax paid). This is for fixing up the house for retirement, etc.

Wills:
Everything gets divided equally among the 4 kids, save that Julia is taking an advance against her inheritance of $13K for nursing school tuition. She will thus get $13K less than that ¼, and the other three kids get $13K/3 more than ¼.
Justin’s share goes into a special needs trust, with Carol’s sister Cheryl Gourley as first trustee, and Elizabeth as second trustee in line. This is to keep the bulk of that out of the hands of Justin’s bio-dad Mike Addington, who is a complete spendthrift, and would go through all of it very quickly, leaving nothing for Justin later in life. This has been set now.

love,
Dad
