# Mom funeral planning
(see also "Mom's assets" note for bank account numbers and list of accounts)

Cremate, scatter ashes all over the world when we go places. Has music plans for memorial service including You Can't Always Get What You Want. 
Wants to get it to where it doesn't have to go through probate court
May want to make some charitable donations
 
I talked with Mom about wills and funeral planning. She said she's fine talking about it more too. She anticipates we'll need to take care of:
* Her apartment properties 
* Gram's stuff
* Her retirement account (she apparently has a retirement account which I didn't realize, which is a relief). She doesn't have much savings to speak of and the cars aren't worth much. 
 
She said she was going to work on getting her paperwork to a point where we wouldn't have to go through probate court. 
 
She wants to be cremated and have her ashes scattered all over the world when we travel. She has informal plans for a memorial service playlist, including the Rolling Stones' "You Can't Always Get What You Want." 
 
She may want to make some charitable donations after her death and will leave instructions.
