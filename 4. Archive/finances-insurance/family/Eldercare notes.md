# Eldercare
(see google drive document for more updateed stuff)


* should we talk to Rachel to see if she or Mark have talked to HW about him? 
* should I talk to Mom? does Julie want to be in on that call? 
* what to tell her about HW and pets if so. 
* does the house go to Mom? if so what will she do with it? if not what will she do then? (move into one of her properties?)
* write up a summary of what we talked about for Julie to look at before call? 

Ok with Mom living nearby, but not in house and not dropping by often
Can hire someone to come by
I could rent a place near her for a while and bring over food. If she's not living somewhere revolting like the house, I could clean. 

Julie: 
* should we talk to Rachel to see if she or Mark have talked to HW? 
* 


- Pets? Hard to place in an apartment and Julie believes she'll let them wreck the place
- Harry? God knows. I'm not ok with bankrolling him to live with mom. But she probably won't move out unless he dies anyway. 
- The house: does it go to Mom? If so she might want to stay there but afaik it's a health hazard. 
- 
- 
- 
- Should I talk to Rachel about Harry? 
- Should I talk to Mom about the house / her plans / her pets?
	- Don't want to suggest more than I'm offering (no HW, probably no pets)
	- She might not be interested
	- What would trigger various plans?
- Should I make an offer?
- Should I talk to Julie? When?
	- after quarantine is over?

ok. here are some scenarios I've thought about





You sent Today at 6:13 PM
1) if at some point she needs someone to come by and help with chores / food / whatever but doesn't need full-time support, we can look into hiring someone to do that (I can talk to Michael about paying for it and I think I can get him to agree)



Julia sent Today at 6:13 PM
I think we will be able to help pay for it but it would have to be after CRNA school. We will be broke as hell for like 3 years bc I can’t work.




You sent Today at 6:14 PM
I am pretty sure I can get Michael to just agree for me and him to foot the bill on the grounds that you'll be in school and are not making money

You sent Today at 6:14 PM
plus we have a lot of savings



Julia sent Today at 6:14 PM
But yeah that sounds good. I am worried though that whoever home health is, if she is still living at Harry’s house, they will deem it unfit for living though. It’s a pig Stye. Actually it’s worse than that. Pigs are pretty clean…

2) if she needs short-term but more frequent support, like up to a few months (e.g. recovering after a surgery or something), I can rent a place nearby and bring by food, help with paperwork, etc

Julia sent Today at 6:15 PM
Well we can talk about that. Cause I’d rather get help for living expenses while im in school than not help pay for mom.



Julia sent Today at 6:15 PM
But that’s another conversation for a much different time. LOL




You sent Today at 6:16 PM
yeah let's talk about it then. I just don't want you to have to be stressed about paying for it in the meantime



Julia sent Today at 6:16 PM
That’s a good idea. B it Rudi and I will be moving back to Knoxville  after nic goes to college and after I graduate so we can take care of that part.




You sent Today at 6:16 PM
if reporting is enough of a concern, depending on what kind of help she needs, we could look into hiring someone very informally who would be willing to not do that.



You sent Today at 6:16 PM
like, not if she needs a nurse or something



Julia sent Today at 6:16 PM
Unless it happens while I’m in school. Then it’s a different story




You sent Today at 6:17 PM
but if she just needs someone to bring her a meal and do dishes or something I think we can get someone who won't do mandated reporting

1




Julia sent Today at 6:17 PM
Yeah. I know plenty of people there that would do it too.



Julia sent Today at 6:17 PM
Right.




You sent Today at 6:17 PM
great



You sent Today at 6:17 PM
if you and Rudi move back to Knoxville and wind up helping her out then I would very much like to contribute to you financially for that, since I won't be there to help



You sent Today at 6:18 PM
or if she has to move out we can probably pay for an apartment



Julia sent Today at 6:18 PM
We can talk about that when the time comes. I just don’t want her living with us.



Julia sent Today at 6:18 PM
That sounds terrible




You sent Today at 6:18 PM
yeah same here



Julia sent Today at 6:18 PM
I feel mean when I say that.



Julia sent Today at 6:18 PM
But it’s true



Julia sent Today at 6:18 PM
So 





You sent Today at 6:18 PM
She can also come live out here in a separate apartment but rents here are so expensive I doubt that would be the best alternative



You sent Today at 6:18 PM
plus Knoxville is where she knows people



You sent Today at 6:19 PM
yeah. I think it's very reasonable to not want a parent to live with you!



You sent Today at 6:19 PM
Gram didn't come live with her.



You sent Today at 6:20 PM
if she does need full-time care, like to actually live with someone, we'll have to talk about it again at that point but I think Michael and I can handle that financially



Julia sent Today at 6:20 PM
Like a nursing home?



Julia sent Today at 6:20 PM
That makes me gag thinking about it.




You sent Today at 6:20 PM
ideally with a family like Gram did

You sent Today at 6:20 PM
do you remember that at all?

Delivered

You sent Today at 6:21 PM
Mom paid a woman to let Gram live in her home and look after her

Delivered

You sent Today at 6:21 PM
instead of putting her in a nursing home

Delivered

You sent Today at 6:21 PM
nursing home is last resort, and I think we can avoid it

The Biden administration also seems to be much more pro-home-health-care-workers than previous administrations and I would not be surprised if they put out a big initiative to recruit / train / subsidize  more people

(I'm guessing you got called away to do something, I'll be away for the next ~45 minutes or so but will check in with you later)


 We should maybe find out whether there are any potential eldercare plans for Harry, since those could impact what we do for Mom.





You sent Yesterday at 9:02 PM
That probably means we need to ask Mom, and then maybe ask Rachel directly because she may have thoughts or plans that she hasn't necessarily shared with either Mom or Harry



You sent Yesterday at 9:02 PM
We should also plan to talk to Mom at some point about the discussion we just had. I can do that if you want, either by myself or with you on the call if you want to be part of it



You sent Yesterday at 9:03 PM
Either way I'll write up a summary of what we talked about and run it by you before the call in case you have comments
