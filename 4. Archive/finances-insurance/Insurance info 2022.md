medical insurance costs

To clarify our medical insurance situation:

• We have a deductible so high we'll never reach it, god willing

• However, our insurance does not require us to reach the deductible before it starts giving a discount on in-network services. We pay an affordable flat fee for visits to an in-network PCP, specialist, therapist, or urgent care and for in-network x-rays and blood tests

• We can still get hit with charges for additional procedures carried out by those providers. I was just charged $175 for a random thing my ENT did as part of my visit.

• We pay a reduced rate for ER visits, MRI and other imaging, and ambulance services but it can still be hundreds of thousands of dollars

What this means:

• We will basically always pay full price for out-of-network services, but of course it's worth it if that's what you need to do in order to get competent care

• Treat in-network care as negligibly expensive.

• For urgent care, if time allows, it's worth looking for a place that bills as urgent care instead of as an ER.

• I don't think there's any action item on the "random extra charges for procedures during your appointment" item; the doctor won't know whether we'll get charged for it and putting it off until you can find out isn't reasonable in terms of time or health.
