I knew by the time I was 8 that she only purchased the books so there was a trail of receipts and she had no intention of actually using them. She didn’t even tell us to read them (I promise I’m not trying to make this into one of those one upping joke threads haha). When I was 15 my grandpa was visiting and he actually empowered me with “permission” to open the books on the shelf that no one ever opened. He picked up the algebra I book and opened the first pages and said “algebra isn’t that hard, you just figure out the missing part” and I (who hadn’t done a math “lesson” since “how to write numbers”) actually thought that looked really fun because I was bored to death (I’m old so no smartphones or even basic cell phones for us, MySpace existed but I didn’t have private computer access). I somehow decided to set the lesson planning for myself that I would go back to the 5th grade math books and work my way up to the “fun” algebra. By the time I turned 17 I’d finished algebra II.

If my grandpa hadn’t picked the book up off the Shelf No One Touches and opened it for me and told me I could do it, I would never have started. My grandpa lived 1000 miles away and it was literally just this one sentence of ACTUAL INSTRUCTION but it was ENOUGH. I think that’s crucial for people to understand about homeschooling. Obviously full instruction would be better but so many of us have been conditioned that we’re stupid and there’s no point in trying to learn because if we were worth it our parents would open those books. I always thought it was a reflection on me and was my fault for not being worth it. My grandpa opening the book and speaking one sentence “algebra’s pretty easy and kinda fun, I know you can figure it out” made so much difference. I think that was the first time in my life someone said they believed I was capable of academic work.
