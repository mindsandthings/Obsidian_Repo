# Homeschool thoughts
A couple meta-comments, for any non-homeschooled onlookers.

My mother framed my unschooling in opposition to conservative Christian homeschooling (as in "they're the bad homeschoolers, we're the good ones") and in opposition to public and private schools. 

It was very different from conservative Christian homeschooling, in some ways that were good and some ways that looked good but weren't. 

It was also very different from public/private schooling, in some ways that were good and some ways that looked good but weren't. 

This thread is about ways those differences were used to frame academic, social, and emotional neglect as positives.

I've found when I talk about the impact of unschooling-related neglect on my life, I almost always get a response that amounts to "actually, public schools are really bad." 

And they are! 

Public schools are profoundly abusive toward a lot of kids, are mediocre for other kids, and underserve almost everyone, some people far more than others. 

Conservative Christian homeschooling is mediocre for a lot of kids, 




My unschooling education was not the opposite of public school. It was also not the opposite of conservative Christian homeschooling. It was different in various ways. 

This thread is not going to be about comparing suffering, because 


It was described to other people (including by me, since I didn't have a more accurate perspective until later) as a self-led education for an amazing gifted kid.

Neglect is not the positive counterpart to abuse (and not just because it often goes hand-in-hand with abuse). 

It involved a lot of hidden neglect, disguised by unschooling rhetoric to look positive. A self-led education for an amazing gifted child! Who wouldn't be impressed?

Who doesn't 

I was also framed as an amazing gifted kid 

my homeschool experience wasn't particularly typical

was better than a lot of homeschool experiences in that it didn't involve abuse, or the kind of neglect most people think of as neglect. 

My homeschool education mostly involved selling itself as 


it and me very positively: a self-led education for an amazing gifted kid. 


My biological needs were not neglected. My physical and mental health issues and my autism and ADHD went undiagnosed, but that was true for those conditions for nearly everyone my age. 

The ways in which my homeschool education failed me:
