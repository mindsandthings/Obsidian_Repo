# Dad's shelf advice

black and decker jigsaw
for screws: look for drywall screws, usually black. self-tapping, just line up a hole and start drilling. 1 adn 5'8 or 2" is plenty probably. but be careful: make sure they're phillips heads. 

use drywall screws for everything

on the first one have your 2x12 at the end, then for the next one have it offset one width of that 2-by. so you can screw it up from one side and down from the other. (not load bearing, just to put in place)

2x12 will stick out from bottom. or just by a 1x8 for bottom supports. an 8-foot 2x8 would divide nicely

top shelf will need an L-bracket to screw into 

baseboards: cut in a bit

jigsaw: coarse blade probably fine
blades will wear out with time
don't push too fast or you'll bend the blade; guide it and let it cut at the rate it wants to cut at

be sure cuts are square to the board
measure twice

At Lowe's, eyeball the wood down the edge and find pieces that are straight. 

Let me also suggest that you get some coarse sandpaper to smooth the cut edges of all the wood. It's cheap and makes a difference in appearance.
