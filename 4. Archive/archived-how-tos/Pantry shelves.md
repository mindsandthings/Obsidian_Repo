To buy:

	•	ONE Two 2x12x8 boards: (update if dad says these can be shallower)
	⁃	2 x seven upper-shelf supports, assuming each 7.25" deep: 50.75"

five 8-feet boards (two 34" pieces each for a total of 10 pieces for the struts; 25" x 5 left over)
	if I dropped to 32" could get three per 8-foot board but would still need 4 boards however the fourth would have 62" left over which could serve as a 50" shelf
