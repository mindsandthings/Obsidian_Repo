1-2x/day: take the lid off and spray all around. When needed, refill the sprayer with spring water
* When you put the lid on, leave it ajar instead of pushing it all the way closed. When it snaps closed it can knock the snails off. 
* When you're doing the daily spraying, you can open the hatch on the lid and spray through there instead of taking the lid off. 

every 2 days: remove old food and put in new food. Carrot strips, leafy greens, anything other than citrus

Every week: Wipe down the walls, remove any obvious waste, make sure the cuttlebone is still visible or put in a new piece (from the box on the dresser). Wipe down just with water, anyplace that looks dirty. Don't try to move the snails. And do check whether there's a snail on the lid before you open it. It's still okay to open it, it just helps not to be surprised.

Wipe down walls, remove obvious waste, ensure cuttlebone is still visible or add new piece. Spray and wipe down with water anywhere dirty. Don't move snails. 

That should be all.
