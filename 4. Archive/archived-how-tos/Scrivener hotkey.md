# Scrivener hotkey
I can’t give you any answer about why the long-press system isn’t working on the scratchpad, but did you know Opt-n followed immediately by n gives you ñ. Opt-n is the “dead-key”—I think that’s what it’s called!—for the ‘tilde’, so ã, õ etc. are easily accessible that way. Other accents are also available: Opt-e for acute; Opt-` for grave; Opt-i for circumflex; Opt-u for umlaut/diaresis; Opt-ç gives you ç; and many more.
