Q. How do I open notes side-by-side now?

    The behavior of Cmd/Ctrl + Enter and Cmd/Ctrl + Click have changed to opening links in a new tab. To open links in a new pane to the right, you can use Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + Enter or Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + Click.

Q. Why can’t I toggle checkboxes with CtrlEnter (or ⌘Enter on MacOS) anymore?

    The default hotkey for “Toggle checkbox status” has been changed to CtrlL (or ⌘L on MacOS). CtrlEnter is now the default hotkey for opening links under the cursor in a new tab. You can change these hotkeys in settings.
