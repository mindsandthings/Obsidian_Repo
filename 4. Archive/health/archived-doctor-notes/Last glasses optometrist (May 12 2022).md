\-\- are progressive lenses made wrong? (for the right eye only, shadowing unless 12" away, feeling like focus in wrong place, after wearing them for a while would get bad headaches but could see a little better)

\-\- got bad enough I started wearing distance lenses all the time with clip-on reading glasses to step them down. Distance glasses are super-clear but feel like trying to "pull" my eyes in toward the center, uncomfortably.

\-\- with both glasses, when I turn my head or move my eyes, my left eye feels like it's "lagging"/jerking.

\-\- other than those three issues - the lagging, the right eye with the progressive lenses, the distance lenses pulling my eyes in - for several months, my eyes felt like they were focusing on the same thing and my headaches were less severe, sometimes I didn't have any headache at all. After a few months, my eyes started feeling uncoordinated - less of a 3-d sensation, small text jumps around,

and I gradually started getting more headaches again

\-\- a few days ago I tried the progressive lenses again and they were still shadowed in the right eye, but extremely comfortable. Blurry at farther distances but clear.

\*\*\*I also need to get my frames adjusted so that the lenses sit further away from my eyes and my eyelashes don't brush the lenses.\*\*\*

\-\- can you do anything about the lagging? why is it worse right after I wake up?

\-\- can I step the distance lenses down to what I can drive with safely so that they're useful for more distances?

\-\- what is the best setup? If I might need multiple lenses per year, can I get distance lenses and use clip-ons for computer and reading/phone? Or is it better to get 1) computer, 2) stepped-down distance, and use clip-ons just for phone?
