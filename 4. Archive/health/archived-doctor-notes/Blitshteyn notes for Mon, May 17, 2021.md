# Blitshteyn notes for Mon, May 17, 2021
You'd asked me to go off mestinon last time, and I did that

My muscles are more relaxed, but I'm not in less pain. I think I'm having more pain in response to exercising after going off the mestinon, and have largely stopped exercising. 

I'm having more fatigue and more orthostatic symptoms, feeling dizzy when I stand up some of the time. Some of that may be due to not being able to wear compression stockings - athletes foot infection that keeps coming back since the end of Dec. 

I'm tired and have very little motivation. 

Salt (if she asks): keeping it fairly consistent. If I have a lot I get a headache and can't think clearly. 


she asked questions and then interrupted me after a few words, over and over again. she's exhausting.


her post recs:
1. Restart Mestinon 30 mg twice a day.
2. Can increase Lyrica to 50 mg at night or 25 mg twice a day for body pain. 

3. You can try acupuncture for pain.
