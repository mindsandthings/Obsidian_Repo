# Dobro athlete's foot convo

over the last couple weeks, I slowly started having worse problems with dry skin and having my feet tingle some at night. some of the skin at my heel was also flaking

my crotch was also a little itchy but that happens sometimes for a while and then goes away

three or four days ago my partner said he thought he'd been having athletes foot issues but wasn't sure because they were episodic for him rather than continuous

I still thought I was having normal dry skin issues until that night in bed when my feet and hands started tingling and burning really painfully, and also got very hot and felt swollen, which they don't do

washed them, used over-the-counter clotrimazole. once in morning once in evening. the first time, 

Sunday our roommates' dog started licking his feet and also my head started feeling dry and itchy


shampoo: use nails to get in scalp, sit for 5 min, wash off. message if need more.

lamisil usually recommend but clotramizole fine too
2x/day whole foot
night: wear socks
hands with cotton gloves
2-4 weeks
moisturize midday with eucerin
