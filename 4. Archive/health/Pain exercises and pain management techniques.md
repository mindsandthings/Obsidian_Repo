--------------
 
Sit straight in chair, lean northeast. Turn to pop lower middle back on left. Pulling left shoulder down and in. 
 
If exhausted after exercising, try base of skull pop left
 
*Proactive*
 
Heating pad with meals; pelvic clocks every half hour
Pelvic clocks every half hour
Morning body scan
Try for trigger points to the up and right of my bellybutton
 
 
Front-lying SI joint reset: arms stretched out in front and chest let to dip; heating pad
Hip joint: 
* Lie on front, turn right leg in, pull body upward for a pop at hip
* Left leg up on bed, rotate out to side
 
 
Then go for a half-hour walk
 
 
 
*Emotions*
* Severe anxiety and pain with any movement whatsoever can be a central chest thing. Also try upper tricep.
* Intense anxiety: bottom of breastbone
 
*Always a good bet:*
* Stretch arms over head
* Lower upper arms and forearms
* Under upper arms
* Check where belt is located on hips
* Check stomach trigger points periodically
 
*Neck and facial pain:*
* Both sides
	* Weird tightness at top of neck both sides and difficulty seeing: Trigger points in armpits; stretching armpits out hard (esp after weightlifting). 
	* After weightlifting: Seriously no idea and everything seems fine: Fronts of shoulders
	* High and/or mid pain: Check sides of neck including topmost part for anything physically out of alignment
* Left:
	* Mid-left neck but not super-high: might be left mid/low/side back muscles pulling on it. Try rubbing them, both back side and front side. 
	* Very upper-most left neck/head: Sit up, lean head back, press against back of neck to rotate it to left (careful not to overdo)
	* Very high top-of-neck headache with significant facial pain: Helped by stretching out underarms very heavily, including lying on side and stretching, and lying on other side and pulling arm over head
	* Sudden upper left: Turn head to right down while lying on right, move around
	* Left upper shoulder/neck can be a lower left hip relax for a long time then roll out and down thing
* Right:
	* Tightness in right side of neck: Helped by trigger point at extreme top of jaw. Left shoulder problems also to some degree. 
	* High right neck but not horrendous: upper top chest yank left
	* May be physically out of position. Check alignment; lie on back and pull gently. 
 
*Right shoulder*
* Crack it on black foam thing
* Left hand push back up/in
 
*Left trapezius and shoulder*
* Trigger points in left upper abdomen
* Also, trigger points in central area where diaphragm is (under and around sternum)
* Occasionally cracking upper midback
* Stretching out underarm very heavily while lying flat on it (underarm trigger points)
 
*Right mid-lower-back*
* Rock a few times then press in
 
*Right hip*
* Sit on chair, swing right leg out to side, roll hip down and forward while pressing
* Put left hand on right back of hip, use right hand to pull knee inward against it (make sure to have it on the outermost prominence)
* Ipsoilias mobilization, right leg back, turn a little more, pressure on lower back to get that one thing to go back into place
* Intense, extremely low hip pain: Check inner thigh on other side
* Pop right hip: Farther out, straighter
* Right hip also hurt; sat in chair, grabbed right knee and pulled it back toward my body; a couple small pops and then a lot of my neck relaxed and also my hip (this was an instance where my hip felt out but it didn't want to rotate)
 
*Right inner midsection*
* Try dropping left hip down off chair (though this may be a left upper back popping issue)
 
* Pop left lower chest back into place on lying down blanket piles
 
*Feet*
* Inside below knees trigger points
