Interestingly, some patients with a vestibular disorder may also experience photo­sensi­tivity (discomfort with bright light) and other vision problems such as: intense discomfort with flickering lights, particularly fluorescent, sodium, or mercury vapor lights, moving objects, rows of similar objects, such as in grocery store aisles or lines of text on a page, or busy, high contrast patterns, such as polka dots or sunlight filtering through mini-blinds. Environments with a combination of fluorescent lighting and busy patterns or moving objects are especially problematic, which is why shop­ping in large stores may be very difficult. Even environments with subdued décor can be fatiguing if frequent head move­ments are required. Sometimes these symptoms of visual super-sensitivity are related to an unrecognized migraine disorder1, and treatment aimed at migraine prevention may be effective. Other times, an abnormal vestibular system and migraine are the coupled culprits.

Individuals with vestibular disorders often experience a visual dependence, where the brain becomes extremely reliant on vision to maintain balance. However, as a result of a VOR defect, this may lead to symptoms when a person’s visual field is over­whelmed (e.g., busy patterns on wallpaper) or lacks a point of fixation (e.g. darkness, wide open spaces). Typical comments from such patients include:
