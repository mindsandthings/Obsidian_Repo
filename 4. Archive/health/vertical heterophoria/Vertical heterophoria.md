"Opthalmologist" 

Always - right back side at base of skull
Frequently - right side of neck; back of head; left side of neck
Sometimes - facial pain or numbness, usually worse on right side. 

Typically the pain/discomfort is a 3-4 (distracting but I can block it out if focusing on something else). At its worst I can't do anything but lie on the floor.

-- Disorientation in visually cluttered rooms, worsening ~15 years ago at same time as headaches began
-- Had to switch to a dyslexic font ~5 years ago for computer reading due to blocks of text shimmering/vibrating on the page
-- Right eye feels like it wants to wander off somewhere else sometimes
