# Pink noise and superior canal dehiscence syndrome
Right ear: 
lowering 3k pink noise makes me look left
lowering 1k pink noise makes me tilt right, raising it makes me tilt left

Left ear: I think it's the 600 and the 1k that make the difference. 
the 1k appears to control back of head/neck, causing me to straighten my neck

If I switch to white noise with 600 and 1k all the way up, muscles even higher up on the back of my head tense




a vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP) test. It checks the reflex in a muscle in your neck that responds to sound.

Bickford et al. (1964) [6] and subsequently Townsend and Cody,[7] provided evidence for a short latency response in posterior neck muscles in response to loud clicks that appeared to be mediated by activation of the vestibular apparatus. These authors made the additional important observations that the response was generated from EMG (muscle) activity and that it scaled with the level of tonic activation. Subsequent work led to the suggestion that the saccule was the end organ excited. 

In addition to the response in the SCM, similar reflexes can be shown for the masseter[17] and for eye muscles (oVEMPs or OVEMPs = ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials).[18]


Tullio phenomenon, another of the more identifiable symptoms leading to a positive SCD diagnosis is sound-induced loss of balance. Patients showing this symptom may experience a loss of equilibrium, a feeling of motion sickness or even actual nausea, triggered by normal everyday sounds. Although this is often associated with loud noises, volume is not necessarily a factor. Patients describe a wide range of sounds that affect balance: the 'rattle' of a plastic bag; a cashier tossing coins into the register; a telephone ringing; a knock at the door; music; the sound of children playing and even the patient's own voice are typical examples of sounds that can cause a loss of balance when this condition is present, although there are countless others. The presence of Tullio may also mean that involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), sometimes rotational, are set off by sound, giving the sufferer the impression that the world is tipping, clockwise or anticlockwise, depending on the site of the dehiscence. Some patients report this tilt as being as much as 15Â°. For such persons, a visit to the concert hall or to a noisy playground may seem like being at the epicenter of an earthquake. A change of pressure within the middle ear (for example when flying or nose-blowing) may equally set off a bout of disequilibrium or nystagmus.[citation needed]

Brain fog and fatigue are both common SCDS symptoms and are caused by the brain having to spend an unusual amount of its energy on the simple act of keeping the body in a state of equilibrium when it is constantly receiving confusing signals from the dysfunctional semicircular canal.
Headache and migraine are also often mentioned by patients showing other symptoms of SCDS due to the body overcompensating for poor hearing in the affected ear by tensing up nearby parts of the face, head, and neck and using them as almost a secondary eardrum.
