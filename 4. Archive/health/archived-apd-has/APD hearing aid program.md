# APD hearing aid program
When I communicate via American Sign Language, I'm an extrovert - I can socialize in a group for four hours and be enthusiastic about continuing, even though my English is way better than my ASL.

When I have to interact using spoken language, I'm extremely introverted - an hour-long interaction in a quiet place often leaves me tired even when I can understand everything they're saying, because I still have to expend energy to make speech into words. In noisy situations with multiple simultaneous conversations, I stop saying anything after a short time because processing words doesn't leave me enough energy to plan responses.

When younger, my primary problem was words often not turning into meaning. As a forty-year-old, my primary problem is fatigue from figuring out what people are saying, and difficulty participating because I can't both process speech and plan responses in time.

I have an autism diagnosis. I also have an ADHD diagnosis; treatment for it improves my auditory attention, which helps me catch more context, but it doesn't make turning words into meaning easier. 

Most of my answers depend on how long I'm being asked to process speech for. "Hear words accurately" - in quiet places, I can figure out what people are saying, even if the words sound like other words.

I first noticed them when I was thirteen. I was homeschooled (no oral classes, just reading and one-on-one conversations, without tests or grades) and socially oblivious. I wasn't in situations before then where my difficulties would have been noticed by someone else, and it wouldn't have occurred to me to compare myself to other kids. I never sought a formal evaluation because I didn't know auditory processing disorders existed until ten years ago when I was thirty, and when I last looked into whether there were effective treatments I couldn't find anything suggesting that they existed.

### My answer to the "you can pay attention well" questions depend on for how long. In a quiet place, for a few minutes? Usually fine. For an hour in a quiet place? It's difficult. For a three-hour workshop, even in a quiet place? I'll be completely wiped out. 

### "You can spell words / read new words correctly by sounding them out" - I learn new words 

### Paying attention depends on how long I have to pay attention for.

Finishing our first 350 trials, here is what we have observed:
1. Most People Benefit
Over 70% of people who have trialed report significant benefit.
Search the keyword “trial” or “trials” in our group to hear more from people who have completed the Sound Sense diagnostic low gain hearing aid trial. Not everyone benefits, but everyone is encouraged to talk openly about their experience.
2. Use = Benefit
Kids and adults that succeed use the aids much more per day. Those that struggle tend to wear them under an hour a day up to two hours at most. Those that succeed, typically wear the low-powered aids 6-8 hours (or more) daily. It's hard to know if people who do well with aids wear them because they are beneficial... or if they are beneficial BECAUSE they wear them.
3. Admitting Difficulty --> Improved Results
People who tend to do the best are also those children and adults who admit they have difficulty. Those who are in denial about their trouble, tend to not do as well and/or don't wear them as often.
4. Certain Age Ranges Succeed More
Nearly all of the trials for children ages 12 and under as well as nearly all of the trials for ages 17 and up are reported as being beneficial. The younger children seem to be more compliant as they are often required to be by their parents. The older teens and adults are aware of their difficulties and willing to take the time to get used to the sound quality of the aids.
5. Teenagers: Search for Independence = Lack of Compliance?
In the 13-16 group, the group we have seen the highest level of non-benefit, teens who openly admit that they are struggling socially, as well as at home or in school, often do very well. Those who do not perceive or admit having a problem (or are too embarrassed to admit one) generally do not perceive a benefit and/or will not comply with trying the aids for enough time to see if there is a solution.
6. Multiple Needs --> Multiple Benefits
Children and adults with multiple needs tend to see multiple benefits, particularly if fatigue, memory, or pain is involved. Sensory issues are often resolved relatively easily, despite initial annoyance - likely as a result of the benefits found.
7. Have FM, Will Love Aids
With the exception of one child, every one of the children and adults we've seen with a history of FM use far prefer the use of hearing aids for social interaction, sports, restaurants, and nearly all situations other than a classroom lecture. Most, in fact, decide to leave the FM system and exclusively use the low-powered hearing aids both in and out of the classroom.
8. Improved Test Scores
To date, we have had to mourn the loss of three IEPs due to improved test scores. We also have had multiple reports from speech-language pathologists of considerable improvements in speech and language, based on objective testing WITHOUT the aids. Two children were reported to have increased IQ scores of 10 to 15 points following a year of use.
Two children were reported as jumping more than 2 grades in literacy, in under a 3 month period of amplification. We recently also were informed of a particular child testing as the very best MAP language arts scorer of his entire 6th grade!
9. Typical Benefits Reported
The primary reported benefits to the trials are: Reduced auditory fatigue, increased auditory attention, increased auditory memory, increased clarity of speech, reduced volume of speech, better hearing in noise, improved mood/self-esteem, improved social interactions, increased skills in phonology such as literacy (reading/writing), decreased anxiety and anxiety related pain and fatigue.
Considering joining our trials?
We offer the most customized hearing aid fittings available in the world, including in-home adjustments.
I'm happy to answer questions, as is Elsa Golden, our Executive Director.

Apparently some people (possibly even the majority of people) with auditory processing problems but normal peripheral hearing get significant improvement with low gain hearing aids. There's little-to-no published research on this, but there are anecdotal reports from individual people, and one clinic has recent unpublished results saying that 70% of people who've tried this report "significant benefit," especially if their symptoms included fatigue, memory, or pain.

That clinic is also offering remote six-week trials of low gain hearing aids. They have you take a screener but do not require a diagnosis. They are US-based, though someone in their Facebook group asked about UK and they apparently do some UK trials too. I don't know whether they do other countries as well.

My understanding is that you have to pay a deposit and shipping (and you have to give the hearing aids back at the end of the trial, or get evaluated and diagnosed and purchase them), but that there isn't a fee to try this

I am very excited about this - auditory processing fatigue seriously impacts my ability to socialize, especially in groups, and it makes pretty much anything verbal harder. I've signed up for the trial and am hoping they accept me.

(auditory processing problems are very common in autistic people, in case anyone in here doesn't know that already)
