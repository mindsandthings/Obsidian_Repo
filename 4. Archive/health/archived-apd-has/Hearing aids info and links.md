"low gain" but idk what else about them, hold on i'll grab the quote


yeah "low gain" and " It’s just important they are new enough to have the features that filter out noise and amplify speech."

I am wondering if I should ask about Bay Area places


I've looked for APD stuff in the Bay Area before and not found it

￼

this is exciting because i just haven't had luck with noise cancelling headphones - i've gotten one cheaper brand plus one more expensive brand and both constantly clicked on and off, i got the expensive company to replace them and the second pair did the same thing, so i just don't want to invest again if the tech isn't going to work well. oh it's in the "ask me i'm an aac user" facebook group, the person i was mostly talking to is named lily huston but there were at least 2 other people on the thread saying the same thing (either re their own hearing aids or a loved ones)

I would recommend Rupa Balachandran - she is very caring and good with kids.
