# CNCS - Cochleovestibular Nerve Compression Syndrome
# WHAT IS COCHLEOVESTIBULAR NERVE COMPRESSION SYNDROME?
![](Hearing%20and%20head%20nerve/pic-cncs.jpg)
Cochleovestibular Nerve Compression Syndrome (CNCS) is the term used to describe a group of audiovestibular (hearing and balance) symptoms thought to be caused by a blood vessel or benign (non-cancerous) tumor compressing the cochleovestibular nerve at the seventh and eighth cranial nerve complex. 
# WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF COCHLEOVESTIBULAR NERVE COMPRESSION SYNDROME?
The symptoms of CNCS can include a variety of vestibular and auditory symptoms including persistent  [vertigo](https://www.californiaearinstitute.com/ear-disorders-bppv-california-ear-institute-bay-area.php) , continual balance problems and “quick spins” that result as a symptom of acquired motion intolerance. Frequently, individuals with CNCS additionally have hearing loss and/or ringing in the ear know as  [tinnitus](https://www.californiaearinstitute.com/ear-disorders-tinnitus-evaluation-california-ear-institute.php) .
# HOW IS COCHLEOVESTIBULAR NERVE COMPRESSION DIAGNOSED?
Initial treatment for CNCS begins with a series of tests in order to exclude other conditions with overlapping symptoms such as  [Meniere’s disease](https://www.californiaearinstitute.com/ear-disorders-menieres-disease-ear-institute-bay-area.php) , migraine, labyrinthitis,  [acoustic neuroma](https://www.californiaearinstitute.com/ear-disorders-acoustic-neuroma-california-ear-institute-bay-area.php) , and fistula. These can include:
*  [Auditory Brainstem Response Testing](https://www.californiaearinstitute.com/audiology-services-abr-bay-area-ca.php)  (ABR);

* Head imaging including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or CT Scan;

*  [Balance testing](https://www.californiaearinstitute.com/ear-disorders-balance-california-ear-institute-bay-area.php) , including electronystagmography (ENG) or Computerized Dynamic Posturography (CDP);

* Audiometry (hearing testing);

* Neurological consultation;

* Blood work 
# WHAT IS THE TREATMENT FOR COCHLEOVESTIBULAR NERVE COMPRESSION?

![](Hearing%20and%20head%20nerve/pic-cncs1.jpg)
After a comprehensive medical examination has been completed by an otolaryngologist and an audiologist, medications can be prescribed as initial treatment to attempt to abate the severe motion intolerance that results from CNCS. If medical treatment does not satisfactorily reduce the symptoms, surgical intervention with a procedure called  [Microvascular Decompression (MVD)](https://www.californiaearinstitute.com/surgical-services-vascular-decompression.php)  can be performed.
Surgery includes lifting the structure causing the compression (usually a blood vessel) off the affected nerve. In most cases a barrier is placed between the two structures (such as Teflon felt) in order to prevent further compression in the future.
The most common side-effect from  [MVD](https://www.californiaearinstitute.com/surgical-services-vascular-decompression.php)  surgery is the potential for an acquired hearing loss or diminished hearing resulting from performing surgery in the region of the seventh and eighth cranial nerves. The eighth cranial nerve (VIIIth) or auditory nerve is linked to hearing and balance. Sometimes as a result of relieving pressure from the nerve, weakness along one side of the face can appear where it did not exist before, a condition similar to Bell’s Palsy. In severe cases, eye complications can occur because of the loss of the blink reflex. If the face becomes completely paralyzed, a nerve can be grafted in the place of the facial nerve which should restore some facial sensation and movement within a year of surgery, however, this function will never return to normal levels.
# CONCLUSION:
If you have experienced any change in hearing or experience dizziness, you should consult an Otologist for a comprehensive medical examination. Otologists are otolaryngologists (ENTs) who have undergone two additional years of training and specialize in issues related to hearing and balance only. With appropriate medical treatment and therapy, individuals with cochleovestibular nerve compression syndrome can make a partial or even full recovery.

### Abstract
Cochleovestibular nerve compression syndrome (CNCS) is the term used to describe a group of audiovestibular symptoms thought to be due to a vessel compressing the cochleovestibular nerve. These symptoms include recurrent vertigo, continuous disequilibrium and acquired motion intolerance. Recently, Moller reported that CNCS can be diagnosed based on abnormalities in the auditory brainstem response (ABR).
After specifically excluding all other vestibular disorders, 63 patients with symptoms suggestive of CNCS were identified. These patients were systematically evaluated with a standard neurotologic test battery, and the results were reviewed retrospectively. Hearing loss was found in 51 (81%) of 63 cases, including 33 cases of unilateral high‐frequency loss and 14 cases of middle‐frequency loss. ABR data were interpreted with respect to Moller's criteria, and abnormal studies were found in 42 (75%) of 56 cases. Abnormal electronystagmograms were found in 57 (93%) of 61 cases. Thirteen of the patients subsequently underwent a posterior fossa procedure for vertigo and, vessels were found in contact with the cochleovestibular nerve in 11 of 13 cases.
The results of this study suggest that the majority of CNCS patients have neurotologic test findings that suggest an abnormality of the cochleovestibular nerve. The results and their implications are discussed.

Introduction

Intrameatal cochleovestibular neurovascular conflict is a rare condition with specific clinical and therapeutic implications. Although surgery is commonly indicated in other neurovascular conflicts, for this subset of patients there is little evidence to guide treatment decisions. Moving from a case description, we performed a review of the literature on this topic to systematically present the best available evidence to guide clinical decisions.
Methods

We performed a literature review on reported cases of surgically treated intrameatal anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA)–cochleovestibular nerve neurovascular conflict, analyzing preoperative clinical data, surgical techniques, and outcomes. We analyzed the levels of evidence using the King's College guidelines.
Discussion

We found 35 studies of neurovascular compression of the cochleovestibular nerve by AICA for 536 patients operated on to resolve their neurovascular conflict. Only 4 of these studies describe intrameatal AICA neurovascular conflicts, for 9 cases, including our own. Tinnitus was the most frequent symptom (9/9), followed by vertigo (2/9). Our case was the only one showing unilateral hearing loss. Surgery consisted of microsurgical mobilization of the AICA loop performed through a retrosigmoid craniotomy. Tinnitus and vertigo resolved after surgery in all cases, whereas hearing loss did not improve after surgery.
Conclusions

Surgical treatment offers the best results for tinnitus and vertigo, but it seems to have no effect on hearing loss, not even at long-term follow-up. Microvascular decompression should be proposed to intrameatal symptomatic patients before the onset of hearing loss.
