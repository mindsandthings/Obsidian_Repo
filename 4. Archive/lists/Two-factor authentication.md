# Two-factor authentication

---------
~**Not done~
Can also do Kickstarter, Reddit, Instagram, Youtube, Github, but am not going to worry about those now. However if I start using them set them up. I also have 2 other dropbox accounts (ebartmess? and theoriesofminds).
Mac OS? https://support.yubico.com/support/solutions/articles/15000006478-getting-started-with-the-yubikey-on-macos
Bluehost? - I don't think this is a possibility
decided not to add pointofknowing or rain.asphalt gmails

**_Done - both yubikeys when possible_**

~Lastpass~ 
* Have both Google Authenticator and Kraken Yubikey set up. 2/13 set up backup Yubikey too, and confirmed my passwords are encrypted and password-protected on small USB key. if there are issues remember they send me an email that I need to click a link in.
