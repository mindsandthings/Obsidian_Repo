@Elizabeth There's now more salmon in the freezer. All the stuff you asked for arrived. Your squash is under the sink with the potatoes. There's one acorn squash but if you want more, you can use the kabocha squash too. Also, if you want more green beans you can use the brussels sprouts in the garage fridge, because they're... thematically similar? Also, I accidentally 3 grapefruits. And you now have 1.5 packs of raspberries in the kitchen fridge. There are also blueberries in the garage fridge that _someone_ should eat.


To eat:
* TOSS GINGER 
* Cassoulet
* half lemon
* use up the honeys for tea
* grapefruit 2
* Bologna 
* vegan cheese spread
* preserved lemons
* pickled onions
* whipped cream
* cassoulet in freezer
* froz chicken nuggets

To cook:
* Friday - split pea soup
* Vegan chorizo
* 

To buy:
* Sauerkraut (for me)
* blue/rasp/blackberries
* celery
* onions
* no bananas. we have enough bananas
* 1 acorn squash
* green beans (I guess 1 lb? for 4 adults + Maya)
