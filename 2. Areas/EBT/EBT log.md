Enjoying what I look at and feeling excited and interested in it

Awareness of transience deepens emotions

Morning Check In: State, “I am creating joy in my life.”

Throughout the Day: Create 10 Joy Points.

**Bring up a happy memory**

Bring to mind a loving moment, a happy reunion, or an experience of intense natural pleasure. Notice that you feel a wave a relaxation and a glow. Remind yourself, “Joy Point.”

**Enjoy a sensory pleasure**

Any natural pleasure that our hunter-gatherer ancestors used to reward themselves can instantly activate a relaxation response and a joy response. Whether it is watching a sunset, slipping into a warm bath, stroking your own body, or hugging a loved one, you can use sensory pleasure to score a Joy Point!

**Engage in a kind act**

Weave into your day random kind acts. Even if it is just smiling at someone, adding some warm words to an email or text, or checking with a loved one about how they feel and what they need, you’ll experience a warm glow. Be aware of that glow. Feel it! You’ve just scored another Joy Point.
