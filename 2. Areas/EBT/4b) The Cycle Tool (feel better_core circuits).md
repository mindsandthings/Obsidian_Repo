\*\*Find peace and power from within. \*\*

**Minute #1: Talk About the Situation**

- I can’t stand it that . . .
- I hate it that . . .

**Minute #3: Negative Emotions Become Positive**

- I feel sad that . . .
- I feel afraid that . . .
- I feel guilty that . . .

**Minute #4: **

• OF COURSE I would do/feel that, because my unreasonable expectation is . . .

I do not matter

I have to be perfect

I do not exist

I am bad

I am not good enough

I do not have power

I cannot do good

I cannot love

I am not worthy

I cannot have joy

**The Grind In**

**• Slow:** Negate your expectation slowly 3 to 6 times. Example: I am worthy.

**• Ramp Up:** Make fun of your expectation 3 to 6 times. That’s ridiculous!

Example: That’s ridiculous! OF COURSE I am worthy!

**• Joy:** State your new reasonable expectation with enthusiasm 3 to 6 times. Example: I am definitely worthy!
