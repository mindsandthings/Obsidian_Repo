**Survival Circuits**

**Step 1.** **Discover the Unreasonable Expectation**

The first step in rewiring a Survival Circuit is to make the unconscious message in it conscious. Once we know that message, we can use that information to change it.

**How to discover the unreasonable expectation:** Use Stop A Trigger. It starts like the Cycle Tool you have already learned, but for the last part, use lead-ins that help you discover the hidden message that is driving you to respond in that unwanted way.

The sentence structure of the Survival Circuit is:

**I get my X (fundamental need)from Y (my response).**

To find that hidden message, complain about the circuit! Begin by saying, “The situation is . . .” and state the facts about the response bothering you. Do not express emotions; just keep it to your complaints. Emotional expression releases stress, and to have the most impact, the strategy is to increase stress so that you can discover a circuit that is as low in the brain as possible.

Continue with the lead-ins for the Cycle Tool until you reach the “I feel guilty . . .” statement. This guilt is not the same as shame. We feel guilty that we did something, and can learn from it. Shame is about self-blame. It’s what you wished you had done differently, your part of the situation. You are really saying: “In the best of all worlds, I wish I had . . . or my part of it was . . . ”

\*\*Step 2. SLOW: \*\***Negate that Unreasonable Expectation 3 to 6 times**

Becky has now unlocked the circuit and revealed the message. Now she needs to change that message. She needs to negate that unreasonable expectation by telling her brain that she cannot get her safety from food.

**How to SLOWLY negate that unreasonable expectation.** The negation statement means that getting safety from food is not possible. Even if she ate all day and all night, food would not give her the safety that she needs. Start with very SLOW statements, which will help the thinking brain stay online.

**Step 3. RAMP UP**

**Make fun of it. How Ridiculous! 3 to 6 times**

The next step is to make fun of the wire. Clearly, it is ridiculous! OF COURSE we cannot get our need met that way. Ridiculing the wire is extremely powerful, as it keeps our emotions ramped up, causing the brain to strongly remember the new message.

**How to RAMP IT UP and say how ridiculous that expectation is!** Do not hold back. Whoop it up and laugh at it. Call out that wire. That ridiculous wire has been tormenting you. This is easy to do. Keep your emotional intensity up and let the ridicule rip!

**Step 4. JOY:** **State a Reasonable Expectation 3 to 6 times**

Now the brain will accept a new message that activates a more effective drive. This transforms the stress-reactive wire into a stress-resilient wire, as emotions turn positive, and the thinking brain comes back online.

**How to be in JOY and state a reasonable expectation.** The brain will not give up the old drive until you encode a new wire of your choosing, a new reasonable expectation. Again, do not rely on your thinking brain alone. Focus on your body and state the lead-in . . .

**Move Forward with Purpose**

**Core Circuits**

**Step 1. Discover the Unreasonable Expectation**

The first step in rewiring a Core Circuit is just like a Survival Circuit – make the unconscious message conscious. Once we know that message, we can change it.

**How to discover the unreasonable expectation:** Use the Feel Better Tool. Again, it’s the Cycle Tool, but for the last part, use lead-ins that awaken your thinking brain to the ridiculous message that your brain is telling you is absolutely true.

The sentence structure of the Core Circuit is very flexible. This expectation gives voice to the message in your unconscious mind. It will surface! Whatever words ring true to you are correct. The point is to really listen to yourself and trust the “body messages” that come to you!

Use this tool whenever you have a really bad feeling, perhaps feeling lost, criticized, abandoned, lethargic, hurting, or rejected. Use it right when you know the wire has been activated. Also, you can intentionally activate that circuit to weaken it by talking about a time when you felt bad. The Cycle Tool has been constructed to help you do that!

Much like switching off Survival Circuits, move through this Cycle Tool until you reach the “I feel guilty . . .” statement. Complete the statement by saying what you would like to do differently. There is no one right answer. Trust your body, and complete the sentence. Watch for words to bubble up. As long as they ring true, you are all set.

Next, just like rewiring a Survival Circuit, state the lead-in: “OF COURSE I would say or do that, because my unreasonable expectation is: (state whatever words come to you).”

Keep in mind that these are emotional wires. You must be emotional to switch them off! Get upset! Care enough about yourself to protest how bad you feel. Express a lot of anger. These wires are encoded without our knowledge or permission. That we have them is NOT our fault, but ONLY we can rewire them, and to do that we must discover the hidden unreasonable expectation that is making us feel bad. To crush and rewire that expectation, we must discover what it is telling us.

**Step 2. SLOWLY****Negate that Unreasonable Expectation 3 to 6 times**

With the core unreasonable expectation in mind, the second step is to negate that message.

**How to SLOWLY negate that unreasonable expectation:** Using the same procedure that you used for Survival Circuits, state the negation statement slowly. Start with very SLOW statements.

**Step 3. RAMP UP****Make fun of it. How Ridiculous! 3 to 6 times**

At this point, ridiculing that expectation is essential. These circuits were encoded by a random life event or ongoing situation that had nothing to do with you. Let’s clear it out! It is essential to be strong and passionate now.

**How to RAMP IT UP and say how ridiculous that expectation is!** Do not hold back. How preposterous! What a ridiculous wire. Emotional intensity is essential now! Go for it! Do not let that wire hurt you anymore. Kick it out!

**Step 4. JOY** **State a Reasonable Expectation 3 to 6 times**

The brain has been awakened by passion, and after negating and ramping up the old circuit, the new one sounds authentic. This transforms the stress-reactive wire into one that is stress-resilient. Now the challenge is to state a new reasonable expectation of your choosing – and state it with joy.

**How to be in JOY and state a reasonable expectation.** State the new reasonable expectation that you want to encode in your brain, the update, and revision of the old, unreasonable expectation.
