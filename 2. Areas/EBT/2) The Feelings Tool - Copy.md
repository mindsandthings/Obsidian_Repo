**• How do I feel?** notice that several feelings (typically three) bubble up to your thinking brain. Allow 10 to 20 more seconds for your brain to identify the strongest of these feelings. Once you know how you feel, move on.

The negative feelings are: angry, sad, afraid, guilty, tense, tired, hungry, full, lonely, and sick. The positive feelings are: grateful, happy, secure, proud, relaxed, rested, not hungry, or full but just satisfied, loved, loving, and healthy.

**• What do I need? **wait for the words to bubble up, tolerating irresolution for a little longer than feels comfortable to you.

**• Do I need support? **err on the side of interdependence, giving to and receiving from others. The emotional brain wants and needs that!
