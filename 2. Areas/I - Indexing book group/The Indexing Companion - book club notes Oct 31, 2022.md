Alexandra (Alex) Pearce - older, more experienced
she tells people she can do 100 pages a week, and then she takes multiple jobs at once
says there are 2 kinds of indexers - ones who do multiple projects more slowly and ones who do one job at a time intesnsely 
canadian
went to 

Judi Heidel - first job is scheduled for Dec, is anxious. brown curly hair and bangs and glasses, 60s?

Kim - actually 

Erin Maher - academic books, musicology. does other things in addition to indexing. 

Susan Stott - straight hair, glasses. pretty quiet- maybe some kind of speech issue? 

Jolanta - 
canadian
Yo-lahn-tuh

twitter - editor sprints - 11 and 7

I offered to do text only coworking. no one was interested (remember this)

Jolanta asks for ability to proof, but only one person has every gotten them for her

people share stories of screwed up indexes by publisher
J phrases as "this is why it's worth your while to have me check the proofs"

J - ISC talks about wanting usability research quite frequently
Alex - Mary (?co?) did a dissertation on it, suspects will come out in next year

(can't you focus on specific quotations? me. be uber careful of sounding complainy. you already got slapped, bitch. you do not have the cred to speak from an info sci authority. remember to be small and meek and "helpful". textual focus, specific quotes with page numbers. you already created a threat. be meek and new. remember, she's irritated with you because everybody else was talking and she couldn't get mad at them)

my observations are insightful, but other people have had them and talked about them and concluded they're useless. 

also she legit did not fucking understand what I was saying about taking a usability *perspective* 

she will send recommended exercises but we can do more if we want

people think you're your mom
people think you'll judge them
