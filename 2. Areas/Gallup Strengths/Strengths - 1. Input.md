Having abdominal cramps from period and not feeling very learn-y. Would like to be though.

Feeling burned out on input again tbh. Have taken in too much, but am not strategically processing it in a disciplined way. It needs boxes to get slotted into.

I'm very tired today, so it's hard to focus. My head feels swollen, and I feel burned out on input - I don't want to take anything in, or do anythign more; I just want to rest. I think it might be learner time, at most.

Working on feeding this via learning indexing. Today I learned some more about vision therapy exercises - the sticking point there was that it took so many tries to find decent info. Last night I also tried a demo of a new game (Cult of the Lamb) and although I don't plan to continue playing, even just trying and seeing new things made me feel better.

I've also gotten Joplin working so I can save stuff more easily, and am trying to be conscious of when I ought to save stuff.

My issue is: most people don't want help. They have their own knowledge and priorities and value their sense of self-sufficiency. More than that, they don't want \*connections\*, often not in general and specifically with someone who thinks they have something to offer. They will even experience it as an aggression or an insult, as a shaming attempt. Input is not a helpful thing; it is a dominance attempt. 

Typically, the information I have at hand is also available via google. 

A lot of my personal growth has come from \*not\* being helpful—from deliberately refraining offering anything. The only two people who wanted me to be helpful were women 20-30 years older than me who wanted constant access. 

I think this isn't just me; it's a big cultural shift in the last ~5 years, and reflects everyone having too much information, being overwhelmed with it, rather than not having enough. 

I would need to also have a very high status such that what people were getting from me was the ability to bask in my attention, not the knowledge.

What to do about the big problem, that the things I'm knowledgeable in I can't deal with anymore.

Core is you want to be helpful, to collect useful information and save it for people later.

You should have a good organization system to find things.
