A high input who is having trouble making a decision may be overwhelmed; a high deliberate who is having trouble making a decision may not have enough information.

At least one person doesn't change much in editing because she's already thought through it and anchored it in.

Another suggests having each project set up on a different desktop so you can quickly flip to work on another.

NEeding to know everythign and review everything to know what works.

deliberative execution - want to always be stepping forward, making forward progress
