I read about this strength and honestly it seems like more of a downfall? Watched video though (notes below) and that was helpful. Review it next time.

# Aug 2022 areas of focus

Ask "would support or problem-solving be more helpful right now?"

Look for when it's analytical stuckness (can see and analyze data in front of you) vs intellection stuckness (don't know what happens next).

Notice when clarity is essential and when it is not.

Identify credible sources you can rely on.

Being able to see patterns in data - data is usually concrete data. (Strategic is often abstract data.) Often get accused of being insubordinate for QTP'ing; taught by life it's not okay to have all the questions. Analytical people often express the need for a trustworthy source. Often are concerned they're not experts themselves because they're high-rigor. Watch for the basement of being closed to something because you've already decided.

High analytical can suspend their theories for long enough to evaluate data. Reputation for close-mindedness is because other people won't give data and don't have patience.

Analytical has clearness or clarity as a strengthâ€”finding the clearest, most precise thing you can say about something. The basement is wanting that clarity/truth so badly you over invest.

Wanting to understand and get to the heart of things.

\[Weighing a decision from multiple places is deliberative; if you have that in your top 5 they may not be distinguishable\]

Always good to say "do you want me to support you in that?"

Knowing you're analytical and others are not helps you understand why other people aren't asking the same questions.

Not accepting things on the first blush - you know you can't trust the first thing people say. Skepticism can be really healthy.

When you get stuck, writing questions to yourself can help. Analytical stuckness: about the data that's in front of you where you can write it down and ask questions about it. As compared to intellection stuckness which is about not seeing anything yet.

Analytical tend to be more complex and more accurate but much slower than strategic.

overlaying patterns and seeing hwo the new data fits into the old

analytical stuckness about the data; not sure if you're doing it right. intellection about not being able to see anything yet. analytical stuckness comes in when revising.
