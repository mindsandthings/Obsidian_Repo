Controlled planning and routines:

I work to develop a daily routine that will work for me. In writing, I try to make sure that my creative proliferation of thoughts gets narrowed and implemented by creating a routine and a plan for how I will work it into the outline.

This strength is really suffering this week. Health hits it, and then it entirely fucks me up.

It might be useful to mention this conflict in coaching.

And also to literally sit down and plan a "Schedule B" and a "Schedule C". And have that in Marvin (do a week schedule but with only one day, and I can drag it in). They key points I think are: 1) just running an hour late, and 2) feeling late and sick and not starting till lunch. And then have a third alt day which is "no schedule day".

# Aug 2022 areas of focus

Develop:

- Schedule B: running an hour late in the morning; conflict with walking
- Schedule C: feeling ill (gastro stuff) and not starting till lunch
- Schedule D: no schedule day
- Schedule E: vacation day

Make visual representations of them. Maybe even put on a calendar. 

Write out very specific processes for how to get back on track after getting off track, including prioritizing projects and redeveloping a schedule. 

Also other templates for different kinds of days, like a day with an outing. Look for kinds of days that share things in common.

Discipline is an executing strength. Avoid spending more time thinking about things than getting them done.

A lot of people with both executing and thinking themes find that there's a tension. 

Plan in advance vacation or sick days even if you do not know when you will take them

figure out how many days you can really write a year, and block out days in advance for days you'll need for something else - then you can shift those around (or get ahead at the end of the month!)
