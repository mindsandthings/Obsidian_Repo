# INPUT

- Find out more about areas you want to specialize in. Consider jobs or volunteer opportunities where you can acquire and share information every day, such as teaching, journalism or research work.
- Regularly read books and articles that motivate you. Increase your vocabulary by collecting new words and learning their meaning.
- Devise a system to store and easily locate information you have found so you can access it quickly. Use whatever approach works best for you — a file for articles you have saved, a database or spreadsheet, or a list of your favorite websites.
- Position yourself as an expert. Share your exceptional archive of facts, data and ideas with others when they need help or advice.
- Seek out subject-matter experts who would be interested in knowing what you are learning and who would find it stimulating to hear about the questions and ideas you generate through your exploration.
- Unrestrained input can lead to intellectual or physical clutter. Consider occasionally taking inventory and purging what you don’t need so that your surroundings — and your mind — don’t become overloaded.
- You might have a tendency to give people so much information or so many resources that you can overload and overwhelm them. Before you share your discoveries with others, consider sorting out what is most meaningful so they don’t lose interest.
- \[My thoughts: the problem is I can't do this it it's not a clearly nameable marketable area. Pl stuff doesn't count, because I can't really talk about it, and when it comes to other stuff, other people know more than I do. Engaging with neurodiversity stuff is painful and upsetting, so it's not an effective venue.\]

# LEARNER

- Become an early adopter of new technology, and keep your coworkers, friends and family informed. You learn quickly, and others will appreciate when you share and explain cutting-edge developments to them. \[If I get involved in indexing, this might be a good aspect to focus on\]
- Respect your desire to learn. Take advantage of educational opportunities in your community or at work. Discipline yourself to sign up for at least one new course or class each year. \[this is a very good idea, since it's time-limited\]
- Find opportunities to expand your knowledge. Take on increasingly difficult topics, courses or projects. You love the challenge of a steep learning curve, so beware of learning plateaus.
- Be a catalyst for change. New rules, skills or circumstances might intimidate others. Your willingness to absorb new and different factors can calm their fears.
- Keep track of your learning progress. If a skill or topic has distinct levels or stages of learning, celebrate your progression from one level to the next. If not, create them for yourself. For example, set a goal of reading five books on a new subject. 
- You place a high value on learning and studying, and you may tend to impose this value on others. Be sure to respect others’ motivations, and resist pushing them toward learning for learning’s sake. 
- You love the process of learning so much that the outcome might not matter to you. Be careful not to let the process of knowledge acquisition get in the way of your results and productivity. \[yes, this has been a problem for me - I haven't taken into account personality/accessibility roadblocks to implementation, and have overinvested in things I couldn't realistically carry off as work because the barriers weren't present while learning.\] 

# DISCIPLINE

- Create structure, and keep things organized.
- Check as often as necessary to ensure that tasks and projects are completed correctly and on time. You feel an urge to do it anyway, and soon enough, others will begin to expect it from you.
- Share your routines and structure. Your detailed lists of tasks, goals and timelines can increase others’ efficiency.
- Accept that not many people are as disciplined as you. Instead of letting their processes frustrate you, try to focus on their results and not their methods.
- Look for roles and responsibilities that are structured and predictable.
- Help others add order to their lives. If you are genuine and respectful when you offer to help, they are likely to appreciate it even more.
- Because of your need for predictability and control, others might view you as rigid and inflexible. Try not to automatically dismiss ideas that do not directly fit into the neat framework you have created.
- As much as you thrive on structure and organization, others thrive on the freedom to innovate. Be careful about expecting others to follow any structure you put in place. \[yes - I don't actually know how to pass things onto others when the require the structure to implement, though!\] 

# INTELLECTION

- Think deeply. Think often.
- ==Set aside a few minutes every day to collect your thoughts. This reflection time will energize you, and your thinking will become sharper and more effective.==
- Get involved in big projects or initiatives in the early stages, before the action begins. You have the ability to follow a trail to see where it leads, and your insights enable projects to move forward intelligently and without backtracking.
- Take time to write. Writing might be the best way to crystallize and integrate your thoughts. Make a list of your best ideas, and refer to it often. Revisiting your thoughts can give you valuable insights.
- Give people time to think through the thoughts and ideas you present. Remember that they have not spent as much time as you have pondering, so they might not grasp your message right away.
- Deliberately build relationships with people you consider to be “big thinkers.” Their example will inspire you to focus your own thinking.
- Because you are comfortable with silence and solitude, others might view you as isolated, disinterested or disengaged. ==Be prepared to tell them that solitary thinking is just your natural process and not necessarily a reflection of how much you care.==
- Some people might think you create needless complexity during discussions and may want you to make decisions faster than you do. Consider tailoring your approach; sometimes it’s better to keep it simple and go more in depth later.

# RESPONSIBILITY

- Take ownership for the things that matter most to you.
- ==Always check your schedule and to-do list before taking on a new request.== This will help you realistically meet all of your commitments without overworking yourself and demonstrate to others that you are serious about your responsibilities.
- ==Align yourself with those who share your sense of commitment.== You will thrive when you are surrounded by others who take their responsibilities as seriously as you do.
- Be an ethical watchdog for your school, organization or community by taking action to eliminate and prevent any unethical behavior you see.
- Let your teacher or manager know that your natural sense of responsibility gives you an exceptional capacity to function independently.
- ==Be selective. Because you are instinctively responsible, it might be difficult for you to refuse requests from others. Sometimes you need to remind yourself to say no.==
- Because you find it difficult to turn down others’ requests, sometimes you overcommit. ==Try to manage your Responsibility talents by giving up something before you take on a new task.==
- Too many obligations can keep you from spending time with the most important people in your life. Remember that sometimes, no is the best answer for the health of your relationships.

# CONNECTEDNESS

- ==Help others see connections and purpose in everyday life.==
- Use your sense of connection to build the foundation for strong relationships. ==When you meet new people, ask them questions to find common ground and shared interests that you can use as a starting point.==
- Consider roles in which you listen to and counsel others. You could become an expert at helping people see connections and purpose in everyday occurrences.
- Help those around you cope with unpredictable and unexplainable events. Your perspective will bring them comfort.
- ==You may react more calmly and passively to others’ bad news, frustrations or concerns than they would like. Be aware that people sometimes need to vent and will want you to validate their feelings more than they want a philosophical response.==
- Some may perceive you as naïve or idealistic because turmoil and upheaval likely trouble you. Remember that not everyone shares your connected view of humanity or believes that every negative event ultimately affects everyone.

# ANALYTICAL

- Use your logical, objective approach to make important decisions.
- ==Identify credible sources you can rely on.== Find helpful books, websites, experts or other resources that you can use as references.
- Get involved in the planning stages of a new initiative or project so you can evaluate its feasibility and direction before it gets too far along.
- Accept that sometimes you will need to take action before all the facts are in place.
- ==Your objective and fact-based approach to decision-making may seem skeptical or critical. Keep in mind that others will have emotional, subjective and personal opinions — and that their input is just as valuable as yours is.==
- ==Because you ask many questions, people may think that you always doubt the validity of their ideas, that you do not trust them and that you are tough to work with. Explain your analysis so they will be more likely to trust your process and your motives.==

# STRATEGIC

- ==Always have at least three options in mind so you can adapt if circumstances change.==
- Strengthen the groups you belong to by using your talent to discover the best path to success. Because you can do this quickly, it may look as if you are “winging it,” so explain yourself along the way to help others understand what you see.
- ==Schedule time each day to think about your goals and strategies.== Time alone might be the best way for you to evaluate all your options and to find the right course of action for each goal.
- Trust your insights. Because you consider options so naturally and easily, you might not realize how you came up with a strategy. But because of your exceptional talents, it will likely be successful.
- ==When working with others, sometimes they may misinterpret your strong Strategic talents as criticism. Be mindful of what is already working well and what others have accomplished.==
- ==Because you evaluate patterns and pathways so quickly, others might find it difficult to follow or understand your thought process. Be aware that sometimes, you might have to backtrack to explain how you got to where you are.==

# RELATOR

- Connect deeply with the right people to gain friends for life.
- ==Try to get one-on-one time with people==, rather than attempting to connect with them in a group. This will help you build the deeper and trusting relationships you value most.
- ==Stay in contact with your friends, no matter how busy you are.== Your closest relationships energize you.
- Make sure people know that you are more interested in their character and personality than in their status or job title. You might serve as a model for others.
- Because Relators typically do not trust others implicitly and people have to earn your trust over time, some may think you are hard to get to know. Be aware of this perception with new people you meet as well as with the people you see every day.
- Your tendency to spend more time with the people you know best might give the impression that you are exclusive or unfriendly to those outside your inner circle. Consider that you might be missing out on the benefits of widening the circle and getting to know more people.

# DELIBERATIVE

- Stop, listen and assess before taking action.
- ==Rely on your good judgment, caution and conservative decision-making during times of change. Your ability to identify and reduce risk is a powerful advantage.==
- Be sure to set aside time for yourself. Try this: ==Reserve 20 minutes each day to sort through your projects, plans and ideas. Use this time to gather information on options, assess different situations or solidify choices you need to make. When you have the opportunity and freedom to calculate, you will make better decisions.==
- Help others think through what they want to do. ==Whatever your role is, you can become a valuable sounding board because you identify and assess potential risks that others might not see.==
- Because you take time to think carefully before making a decision, people might perceive you as forgetful, slow or afraid to act. Be prepared to explain that you are none of those things and that you are just considering all of the potential next steps.
- Your cautious and serious outlook on life might give the impression that you are a distant, private and unapproachable person who doesn’t give much praise. Keep this in mind, especially when the important people in your life need your approval and validation.
