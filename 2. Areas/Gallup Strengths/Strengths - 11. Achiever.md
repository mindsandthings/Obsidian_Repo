Achiever

the more you're active and busy the happier you are

trying to find something you can control and work at at hard to make you feel thing swill be okay

all goal-setting, working constantly toward them. what do I need to get done? not good at giving grace if don't meet it

have to start with baby steps to get back to where you can be

don't do vacations well

it stresses me out when things are there to be done and not getting done

having new goals every time you meet hte old ones is a generative behavior - it's good

going full indie really helped - achiever not fed by someone else's decision-making process
