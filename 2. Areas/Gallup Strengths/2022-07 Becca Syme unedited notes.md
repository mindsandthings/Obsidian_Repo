Connectedness: think of your writing in terms of purpose

Restorative: while I identify with the strength, all of these people sound awful. They seem likely to be extremely aggressive and abusive in their desire to fix others, and extraordinarily overconfident, and to refuse to acknowledge that others have reasons for doing what they're doing.

Relator: getting to know your characters as you write them.

Discipline: the process of planning and developing a schedule helps recalibrate. Have different templates for different days, so you know which one to implement.

Basements:

Analytical: basement is thinking you're not good enough, incorrectly.

Connectedness: connecting all the things and putting them all in the same book, connected. Watching the destruction of relationships and losing connections with people who matter to you is devastating. Develop a gratitude practice.

Discipline: to help, implement new strategies and new structure

Becca Syme unedited notes

Getting unstuck list:

Review and tighten the outline

Check on the stakes - am I missing something about the character's backstory/thought process that would make the stakes clear?

Look for where I made a wrong decision and need to back up and change it

What I like about books

\-\- clear easy to follow prose

\-\- vivid visuals

\-\- clever, incisive turns of phrase, esp wrt social commentary

What's good about my work

\-\- cute, charming, feel-good

\-\- weird and unusual/quirky

\-\- humor

"Look at the places in your life that are causing you the most difficulty. What is the assumption you're making that causes the struggle? QtP. ...the problem you consciously identify is almost always two steps ahead of the actual thing that needs fixing. Ask: should you? Look for the first conscious instinct, and the subconscious assumption. Often there isn't a problem to be fixed, there's an unrealistic expectation about the fact that there is a problem."

Input

• writers block happens when you've squeezed out everything you've input

•

Strategic

• yes, getting stuck because I can't see a roadblock. Get stuck, go backwards, look for intuitive spot. What can I not see beyond?

• if you try to know more than you should know it's like you freeze it - there are some decisions with strategic you can't make until you get there.

• if you work with another person this can result in you having to overexplain - tell the other person stuff you shouldn't know yet

• you're going to explain to people that don't get it, you're gonna have to trust yourself

Learner

• Writers block because they don't feel like they know enough to write a good novel

• A "certainty seeker" strength

Intellection

• A "certainty seeker" strength: I haven't thought about this enough, I can't see this enough, I don't know what's going to happen - especially hard to get started

• you can trick intellection into experimenting, you can tell if it's your competency with the story or somethign else

Responsibility

• Can keep you stuck in a particular book because you're too committed to an outline or to what you told somebody

• if you promise fans something will happen (even for good reasons) it can screw you up

• if they know what their fans want they feel like they have to deliver it even if it's contrary to who they are as a writer

Looking over Gallup's descriptions, I also ID with:

\-\- Relatinoship building: Individualization (13), maybe Includer (33)

\-\- Influencer: communication (29), maybe maximizer (34), maybe activator (25), maybe significance (26)?

\-\- Executing: achiever!!! (17), arranger (21), maybe balance(??? not in list), definitely deliberative, definitely discipline, probably focus (16)

**Restorative (11)** and maximizer - tending toward perfectionism - people who have both, can't let something go

Later they talk about relationships with characters slowing you down - empathy, feeling pressured to push some characters into the background

Highlight (Yellow) Page 7 Alignment is symmetry between your self and your systems. Between your purpose, your personality, your platform, your capacity, and your goals.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 14 Several of these themes of Strength® cause a person to need more time processing. If a person does their best work when they process information over and over in their head before it comes out of their fingers onto the page (or their mouth, if they’re speaking), why are we trying to short-circuit that process? The most common Strengths® among my coaching clients are ones that take more time to process information (sixty percent of the people who’ve either been coached by me or gone through my classes), so I see this premise a lot. Someone told me I can’t edit a blank page, so I should just vomit the words out onto the page and stop thinking before I write. Well, it turns out, you can edit a blank page. If you have certain Strengths®2, one of the hallmarks of how your brain works is that you’re editing in your head, before you ever put words down on the page. This is part of how you get your gold. In fact, your best work is going to come when you edit the page in your head, instead of on paper or on the screen.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 69 First, I want you to think of your favorite books. I want you to quantify, as much as you are able, what you love about them. What keeps you going back? Make that list. I want you to see, by and large, how you talk about what you love about books.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 71 What are the common phrases that readers use to describe your books? What patterns do you see in what they praise? What was memorable for them?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 71 (which, really, I understand—it’s okay), then talk to a couple of readers or to your editor. Ask what stands out about your books. What’s memorable. What do they love. What are you best at. What’s the best craft element in your writing.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 72 Your development plan should consist of targeted learning based on what you’re already doing well. Study the techniques that lie underneath this capacity. Study other writers who do this better than you do. How are they doing it? (Not so you can plagiarize them—let me be clear—but so you can learn from their techniques.4)

Highlight (Yellow) Page 79 When you need time and space to think about stories or characters or plots, then you need time and space.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 154 Look at the places in your life that are causing you the most difficulty. What is the assumption you’re making that causes the struggle? QtP.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 90 This is what I call “questioning the premise.” It’s the art of listening for the assumptions that someone is making so we can decide if that person is going to align with us or not.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 91 You are so wrapped up in listening to either their certainty or your fear of failure, you're not doing any kind of logical evaluation of whether you should or should not do the thing.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 91 When you hear the word “just”, stop and ask yourself, “is that thing as easy for me as it is for them?” If the answer is no, then you’ve just questioned the premise.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 92 When we take in all advice as equal, just because the person is a known name, or because our friend recommended them, then we’re not being discerning about whose advice we will follow.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 93 Strategic quitting looks like: this isn’t going to be worth it in the long run, so I’m wasting my time trying to make it happen.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 100 Of course, also remember, not all rest is created equal. Sometimes, rest looks like taking a break from expecting words or ads to get done because you need to clean your house, or rearrange your office, or get a new car, or move. Sometimes, rest looks like actually laying down and sleeping. Sometimes rest means eating better so you can get better quality work time and sleep time. Sometimes rest means reading books. Sometimes rest means unfollowing newsletters, clearing internet tabs, closing accounts, hiding or unfriending people on Facebook, or putting an auto-responder on your email. It might even look like deleting email. Or taking your email off your website so you're not as reachable.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 118 If you are highly driven, you might need to do a lot of small tasks that have been piling up and going undone so you could "do the more important writing work". All of that pile is creating cognitive dissonance, just sitting there undone. Take some time to address the pile. The “small wins” will help give you energy to build your ladder.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 119 If you are highly curious and intelligent, go to libraries, go to museums, go to lectures, have new experiences, learn something new, immerse yourself in something that will excite you and bring you new ideas. Those energy pennies will be golden. Often, in the pit, we don’t want to “go out” and Netflix can be a comfort activity. Sometimes, Netflix is all you can handle. But as much as possible, try to get out of the Netflix environment and find a new environment.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 120 If you are highly success-oriented, you have to surround yourself with people who reframe your self-confidence for you. Take yourself out of situations where you feel a lack of confidence. Put yourself into situations where you are reminded of how good you are and how what you're doing is right. Cut out the places that don't support this message. (And listen to me carefully here:) No. Matter. Where. They. Come. From. And. No. Matter. How. Hard. It. Will. Be.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 121 Quick note to those of you who have taken the CliftonStrengths® assessment. There are special hacks to building ladder rungs when you know your Strengths. With any Strength, look at the list of qualities from your report. Those are the things that give you energy. Do those things.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 141 Commit to one or two things that will bring you energy pennies. Many of us can’t handle much more than that. The inertia of our lives can’t take a complete overhaul. But if you limit the “make pennies” to one or two things, then you are more likely to be doing them in sixty days.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 146 I did a six-part series of videos on burnout that may be more parts by the time you watch them, but here is the link to that playlist. I hope it’s helpful.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 21 Stopping them requires two things: 1) Awareness of their action/purpose 2) Stronger rope guards That’s what we’re going to do in this book. I want to bring awareness to the letters (their content), to the presence of those messengers, and to the button-pusher. Because we want to strengthen our rope guards. That is the goal.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 37 Whenever you hear someone talking about numbers in any kind of author presentation, non-fiction book, or advertisement, always ask yourself first: (1) is this a credible source—what’s at stake for them to make the numbers come out in their favor; and (2) is it reasonable, based on even just my own experience, to think that there is another way to organize this data? And

Highlight (Yellow) Page 38 if you are a person who is overwhelmed whenever we start talking math, then never let yourself make a decision in the moment where numbers are concerned. Always put a pin in it, give yourself the time to process through the data in your own way. Don’t fall prey to “this person has to know what they’re talking about” logic. Walk away from the advert, or from the presentation, or from the webinar, or from the conversation, and give yourself the space to get out of fight-or-flight math adrenaline mode.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 50 go and take the test. And some of you are going to get frustrated with me, but I’m going to say it anyway: don’t take the free versions. Go to my.gallup.com and take the paid test.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 50 make sure you watch the Gallup Theme Thursday videos on YouTube, and watch the Strengths for Writers videos on the QuitCast YouTube channel. Knowing more about your strongest and least plastic neural nets is never a bad investment, because the yield could be exponential.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 51 at least make a contract with yourself that, for one week, you will question the premise whenever you start to beat up on yourself. Just for one week. When you start to hear the negative self-talk, just ask yourself, “But is it? But should I? But will they?” Just question the premise.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 55 people are much less likely to share their actual advice in forums and groups than they used to be. All of the actual helpful stuff I've learned about the industry in the last two years has come from personal connections and discussions,

Highlight (Yellow) Page 65 only about half the writers I coach/teach are actually in this to make a regular living from selling books.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 65 if there's any way you can possible decide not to try to make a living from your books, I would consider this premise carefully, for your own sanity.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 65 It is not worth the strain and the stress to do this if you can do anything else for a living right now. Some

Highlight (Yellow) Page 73 Some of the You. Are. Wrong. letters that we get are just too strong, and they come from places that are too inaccessible. If this is you, then know that there are multiple ways to run ads. Not everyone has to run ads with spreadsheets and data. If it overwhelms you, don’t worry about it. Minimize it to the lowest common denominator you can handle. Worry only about the important data: sales and spend. You can do everything else by instinct if you want. (I’m not promising high sales from that—I’m just saying,

Highlight (Yellow) Page 74 The problem is, it is that hard for some people. And it’s their money. If they can’t pay someone and can’t figure out a data-heavy system, then let them worry about the metrics they can handle. The truth is, that’s what they’re going to do anyway, when they get overwhelmed. And on top of it, they’ll feel stupid for not being able to understand whatever “easy” system you’re using. If they make more than they spend (most of the time) and they’re okay with that, then who are we to tell them they can’t do it?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 80 No one can deny that one of the most important factors to "pleasing" the "algorithms" right now is speed of production. A few years ago, the speed was six a year. Then it was nine. Then it was twelve. Now, in 2019, it's closer to eighteen or twenty. And guess what? This is only going to get faster. Next year, it will be 24, without hesitation. It's not going to slow down (unless there is a \*\*major\*\* shift in reader habits, which is always possible).

Highlight (Yellow) Page 81 No, you don't need to write twelve books a year. If you're going to play that game, you need to write twenty-four. But you also can't write twenty-four books a year without doing things differently than you've ever thought they could be done before. And even if you could write twenty-four, then next year, you're gonna have to write thirty. So, at some point, you're going to be out of runway, dear writer.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 86 a good majority of people who are “scared” of indie publishing have a very fine sense for the sheer amount of risk involved in self-publishing. A healthy fear of things that rely on “luck” is just that. Healthy.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 90 If you go in planning to lose money, then you're surprised if you make money. Pleasantly surprised. But you're never disappointed that you expected to do poorly and then did poorly. And most importantly of all, you haven't bet your livelihood on it.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 94 When you have to create something out of nothing, and it's dependent only on your ability to have quiet, creative brain space, then you cannot treat those jobs the same. So, when something happens that blocks your creativity, it's similar to going on disability from a physical labor job. Your brain is your work. When something messes with your brain, it messes with your ability to create something out of nothing.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 105 I talked earlier about having stronger rope guards in the area of generative mistake-policing. If you are having a degenerative experience with mistake-policing on a regular basis, and there is a major fear of failure attached to this,

Highlight (Yellow) Page 114 go check out Tammi Labrecque's book Newsletter Ninja.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 135 If you feel like you’ve never really had a plotting book (read: an outlining book) that’s worked for you in the past, go check out Verbalize by Damon Suede.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 147 There are writer brains out there who need significantly more thinking time than other writer brains. They need to process, sometimes for days or weeks, before they can put words on paper. And sometimes, they get stuck for days or weeks because something hasn't been puzzled out yet. This is not a deficiency. It is not a lack of appropriate planning. It is a Strength behavior. This might be a sign that your brain is doing what it's supposed to do, if you are wired for this.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 148 There are absolutely people who need the process time who can write almost every day. They tend to get good incubation time for their thoughts to move (driving, walking, running, showering, doing rote household tasks, playing certain kinds of rote games). It's not out of the realm of possibility that you might still write most days, even if you need this process. But there's a difference between "writing every time there are words ready" and "writing every single day, no matter what."

Highlight (Yellow) Page 148 And of course, because there are some people who thrive on writing every day, let me say: if you are wired to be more disciplined or consistent, then you will thrive on writing every day. And if there are things standing in the way of you being able to do that, then I would strategically attack those things so you can get more consistency.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 149 Make a streak calendar. See, for yourself, what happens if you get a streak of days in a row. And then if you hit a day where you need to think instead of write, make a different color streak. Make sure you are getting that thinking time in, even if it's that subconscious incubation (doing something else with your conscious brain at the time). Don't fill all your spaces with input (classes, podcasts, research, etc.). If you need the time to think, take it.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 153 You type the wrong sentence and you get an essential pain hit. You want to go back and fix that sentence. If you keep writing, you will think about that sentence (and probably keep looking back at it). You’ll find yourself going back and reading sections to make sure they’re right. You’re getting the tracks laid so the train can keep moving forward.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 156 When you have certain personality traits that make you more emotionally receptive to the thoughts and feelings of other people, there is a tendency toward confusion about what’s really important to you. The more certain someone else feels about what everyone’s priorities “should” be, the more easily it is for you to adopt those priorities. When someone believes very strongly that “all good writers write fast,” it’s easy for you to take on that mantle because of their strong feelings.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 156 you may have to constantly check in with yourself and make sure that the priorities you’re setting are actually yours, and not someone else’s.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 157 if you process by talking, then you're going to spend too much time talking with no linear progression. What this looks like is: you’re going along, dictating dialogue, and then you get to a transitional sentence, and you have a hard time seeing what should happen next. Your instinct is to say something out loud like, “I’m not sure what will happen here—they need to move from the factory to the police station, and maybe I don’t need to write that at all. Maybe I can just say, they arrived at the police station.” It’s like you have to talk through what you’re seeing before you can “write” the narrative. You’re processing. The more often you have to do this, the harder dictation will be.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 158 Most of you who fall on the "external" side of the story process will have some version of the following in your history. * You plot out loud. * You call a friend when you're stuck and talk through your plot or character. * You don't know whether your book has landed or not until someone reads it. * You can only see your story structure when the story is finished. The

Highlight (Yellow) Page 158 utilize verbal planning as part of your dictation prep (before you dictate, you do one of the four things above). Even then, it might be hard to get the actual words of the manuscript to come out right because your tendency to verbally process will create a start-and-stop dictation style that might not make you any faster.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 159 Try two things. First, open your manuscript before you open anything else on your computer (or phone--no reaching for the phone in the morning). You don't have to write yet if the words aren't there, but if the words are there, write as many as will come out. Don't worry about word count. Second, go for a walk or a drive or take a long shower before you write words. There's a good chance that the reason you're struggling to get words on the page is that you haven't processed the story enough yet, so it's not ready to come out.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 173 If you don't know whether or not signings will get you to what you want out of your author career, use some of these discussion points above and journal about it. What will make you look back, in ten years, and think, "this author signing was worth it?" And then look at how likely you are for that to happen. Know thyself, dear writer.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 176 when we see other authors doing something that seems to be helpful, one of our subconscious behaviors is looking for the norms of that group. We want to be a professional author. We want to belong to this group that we care about. When we see someone else talking about their assistant, we subconsciously decide that one of the characteristics of being an author is having an assistant, so we think we need one of those as well.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 177 you don't have to prove you are a real author. You just are one. Are you writing books? Have you written books? Then you're an author. You don't need any other accoutrements to prove it.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 180 When there's a job you can't do yourself, or you can't do without damage to your writing. Many of us get sucked into social media in a way that is so destructive, it's actually not worth the return on investment of our time. Many of us can't run our own advertising campaigns without significant stress. Some of us are not math-inclined and we can't do our own receipt work, or we need someone externally holding us accountable to turn things in (otherwise we get stressed around tax time). Some of us really can't be in our own inboxes. We get so caught up in all the things there are to do to keep up with the author business, we need someone to manage that for us. None of these things are uncommon. If it's going to get you more writing time or more thinking time to process those books, and you are financially able, then it's worth hiring out for this.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 181 If you're not getting more writing done because of the assistant, or you're not able to get ads run because of them, or you're not able to get admin done quicker, then it's not worth it.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 193 It’s because of wiring. You’re telling yourself that you're wrong so you'll conform with a subconscious norm. And what we’ve learned so far is that awareness of this little messenger / rope / guard / button-pusher scenario is one of the most important things you can start to be aware of now.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 197 1) Strengthen the rope guards. Get them some tools or skills that will help them manage the stimulus. This might be a program like Bright Line Eating (which helps me understand sugar and flour addiction), and is extremely skills based. It might be something like EBT (which helps me deal with the emotional part). There are several ways to add skills to—or strengthen—those rope guards.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 198 2) Change the environment so the letters don’t get written. Take the sugar out of the environment so I can’t choose to eat it. (Of course, I’ll still need help with skills because I’m going to have cravings. And I still might need a program.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 198 But if you substitute something like “distractibility” here, you can still do those two things. 1) Strengthen those rope guards: Use the Freedom app or a Pomodoro timer when you’re on social media or in email. 2) Change the environment so it’s not triggering the letters. Don’t use your phone first thing in the morning. Open your manuscript instead of your browser first thing in the morning. You either strengthen the rope guards, or you change the triggers. Those are the easiest ways to deal with this process.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 200 When the brain is triggering a You. Are. Wrong. letter that’s unhelpful, we want to do our best to open that letter before it crosses from subconscious to conscious. Be aware. Some of them are still going to get through. That's okay. You can't have 100% compliance. If you stop even one letter from getting through, that means you're more likely to stop two tomorrow. It's a numbers game. If you, on the other hand, become aware of the You. Are. Wrong. letters getting across your velvet rope, and you do nothing to stop any of them, then you're more likely to keep letting them through, but now you also feel guilty about letting them through.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 201 The rope guard is asleep or drinking bourbon or watching a pretty girl in a red dress, and BAM! Letter to the button-pusher. Delivered to Charlie quadrant. Now the guilt-emotion of "I am a bad writer because I am not plotting my books" gets soothed with, "PLOT THAT BOOK!" and the guilt goes away. Problem solved. But is it? If the Boss is not a plotter, then no, the problem is not solved. The emotion triggered a response, but the response was the wrong one. This is a You. Are. Wrong. letter we want to stop at the rope, before it gets to the button-pusher. What we’ve done in this book is look at some of these letters that are getting written, and tried to deconstruct whether they’re letters that belong across your rope or not. Are they worth letting your button-pusher open them? That’s the question. Regarding the “you must plot!” letter. Many of you have already decided this is not a good letter for your button-pusher to get. You’ve already developed a stronger or more alert rope guard in this area. Your guard is now fully awake and fully on the lookout for that letter coming across again. Your rope guard is strong enough to stop even the most experty-of-experts from crossing that border with one of those you-should-plot-your-books letters. They are on it.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 17 The creative mind (especially when certain high-process-oriented personality traits are present) requires the same fallow-ness. I’m not saying everyone needs to take a whole year (or winter or season) off from writing. “Fallow” time looks different for each writer. But for some of us, our minds really do need more fallow days than others, and that can be a common source of writer’s block. Those of us who are wired to look to other people for the “best practice” can sometimes overlook this need for fallow time in our own brains because we’re primarily looking at others’ processes.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 18 For some of us (the “thinkers” of the bunch), the “something” happening under the surface is the most important thing that happens in our brain. It’s part of what makes the words happen on the page. It is not a distraction from the page. It is the page.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 20 If the block is being caused by something necessary, then we want to acknowledge that first, because there are specific strategies to handle a block when it’s beneficial. Like the fallow time. You let the field be fallow, gather its nutrients, and then you plant again. You don’t keep trying to harvest from a fallow field. You create the right environment for the creative energy to come back, and then you seed.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 24 It’s possible for some people to write in uncertain times, but it’s also because they’re creating certainty for themselves. They’re addressing whatever physical or safety needs they feel most acutely (because, again, not everyone feels unsafe or uncertain for the same reasons), and then they are creating.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 30 The entrance into the fear spiral is the little moment where the cursor is scarier than anything else in your environment, and you’d rather not face that fear right now, so you go to Facebook, hoping to distract yourself from that essential pain. Then, you try to talk yourself back into it, and you spiral away again and back to Facebook. And

Highlight (Yellow) Page 32 When fear is involved, there’s no path directly to action. There’s only gravity and a funnel and a spiral. And sometimes, when the fear is big enough, that coin keeps spiraling and spiraling out of control, and never drops into the bank where the action happens. If we start to be more aware of when the fear crops up, then sometimes the spiral can be interrupted. That’s what we need to know.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 32 Are you seeing a predator on the blank page? That’s what we’re trying to determine here. Because if you are, then trying to force you into an action point isn’t going to help.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 33 When there’s a premise causing the fear, we have to deconstruct it. That means we have to talk back to it. We can’t keep agreeing with it. If the fear is, they’re all gonna laugh at you, you say back to the fear, yeah, I’ve been laughed at before and I made it through. I’ll be okay. If the fear is, they’re going to find mistakes in your work, you say back to it, yeah, there are mistakes in the works of the greatest authors. Mistakes don’t make me a bad writer. They just make me human. I’ll be okay. If the fear is, the book isn’t going to be good enough for everyone, you say back to it, yeah, no book is good enough for everyone, and it shouldn’t be. No one likes every book. I’ll be okay.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 34 That “parental” soothing voice is really important to engage in these moments because in order to flatten out that spiral, we need to deconstruct the premise of the fear. We can’t agree with it. And in this step, it’s really important to not let ourselves ask rhetorical questions. No what happens if that has no answer. This is one of the skills that emotionally resilient people have developed for themselves over the years. What happens if the book sucks? I’ll write a new book. What happens if everyone hates it? Other authors have survived that before. I’ll write a better book because of the mistakes I made in the first one. What

Highlight (Yellow) Page 34 If you ask those above questions without their subsequent answers, you’ll end up dropping the coin into the fear spiral instead of into the bank of action. Rhetorical questions are the worst. No rhetorical questions. Always make your logical brain answer the questions you’ve asked.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 35 Second action step: we need to clear the emotions that are leading us to the fear. If there’s a fear of failure or success, we need to gently walk through that process (for a great book on this, check out the Secret Thoughts of Successful Women by Dr. Valerie Young or Wired for Joy by Dr. Laurel Mellin). We may need to feel those feelings in a safe place so we can deconstruct them.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 35 This is a place where I recommend therapeutic approaches, to make sure you’re treating yourself safely (because we often don’t treat ourselves safely when we’ve assimilated skills meant to keep us in a certain state of emotional instability).

Highlight (Yellow) Page 41 our brains are very smart and adaptive, and when we make the same decision for most of our lifetime, our brain learns that decision is one to be made as quickly as possible.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 41 if you happen to be emotionally receptive, you’ve been practicing that set of decisions since you were very young and you’ve become quite good at them. You’ve likely developed consistent patterns of behavior that support the personality tendency toward being empathetic. You’ve learned skills to support the patterns.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 45 go and take the CliftonStrengths test and then listen to our Quitcast videos on the Strengths for Writers methodology.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 52 Why didn’t they like my book? What’s wrong with them? That kind of questioning is so often blocking for certain types of writers, specifically because their phoropter is configured to precise 20/20 vision, but they’re writing for a group of readers who don’t have that same definition of “good.”

Highlight (Yellow) Page 54 some of us are really stopped by this. Either we need to readjust our phoropters, or we need to find the readers who want the particular brand of blurry-ness or clarity that we’ve got behind our glasses, and we need to embrace that part of ourselves that wants what we want.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 59 If you don’t know what to write, you can’t see what comes next, you’re not able to make the words come out… that is not resistance. That is a different problem.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 59 If your tank is empty, you have to fill it. Period. It’s physics, y’all. Go fill your tank if you need to, and don’t feel guilty about it. That’s the solution to burnout. Recovery.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 66 Every expert has a chance to help you. But not every expert can / will help you. And part of your job as a smart better is to figure out which expert has a good chance of helping you. And if they end up not helping you, then that’s not. on. you. Super important to internalize that.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 67 It’s not your job to fit the mold of whatever expert is telling you to do whatever thing. It’s your job to be the expert in yourself and your fit, and to leave behind (as quickly as possible) the advice that doesn’t work for you. And some of you need permission to do this, because of the way you’re wired. By the metrics of success, you officially have permission to do this. Because the way we should be judging the effectiveness of someone’s advice is not by their success, but by ours.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 67 Think hard about this. Where is it time for you to back a new horse? Where is the “common advice” making you blocked in your process? Who can you release to do their work for other people, not for you?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 75 There are a lot of people for whom sitting down to write should be the last thing they do in their process, and not the first. Because they are waiting not for a magic muse to come to them in their attic, but they're waiting for their brain to finish processing the data that's churning around upstairs and that process, my friends, cannot be rushed, it can only be endured. There are things we can do to make the process easier. I call these the "incubation" steps.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 75 there are things that our brains can do to speed up the process of "inspiration." They usually do not include sitting down at the computer. Almost never. What do they look like? Well… some of you aren’t going to like hearing this, but they might include: walking driving playing video games playing mindless computer games watching television doing the dishes riding on a train sitting in a chair, staring at the ceiling

Highlight (Yellow) Page 80 when a Trucker gets stuck, they need the reminder to re-establish a normal.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 82 when it used to be fun and now it isn’t, there are always reasons for that. You might have put too much pressure on yourself, or you might be believing things about the outcome that aren’t true, or you might

Highlight (Yellow) Page 85 some of us don’t have the words readily available at our fingertips because it takes us more time to translate our thoughts into words.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 86 If you take a longer time to form the words, it’s going to take longer to sit down and write them.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 86 some people’s brains are like a bread machine. They open the lid, put all the ingredients in, and close the lid. The machine (the brain) does the work of turning over the ingredients, making the dough, letting it rest, baking it, and then creating the pressure (the ding at the end) to open the machine and take the bread out and make a sandwich.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 87 If the story isn’t finished cooking, and you open that bread machine, what you pull out of there isn’t going to be sandwich-worthy. It may not even be edible.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 87 The “just write” advice is the equivalent of pulling the bread out too early partly because there is still work to do on the bread when you pull it out early. You still have to finish baking it, only now, it’s not surrounded by the heat elements anymore. Now it’s out on the plate, and you have to apply heat to it so the internal structure of the bread becomes intact. Have you ever tried to use a hair dryer to cook bread? That’s not unlike what this process can be like when you pull the story out too early.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 97 Strong objective-deciders need the outline. They are at their best when they can consider, analyze, strategize, map, and execute, before they jump in. They will move the fastest if they can make the decisions they need from outside the plot. They are going to be good at following that plan once they set it. Strong subjective-deciders do not need the outline. They are at their best when they jump into the book and figure the plot out from the inside of the writing. Their proverbial fingers need to be on the glass in order to know where they are. If they try to stand outside the snow globe and plan a path through, they will often plan the wrong path, because once their fingers touch the glass, they realize how they’re really going to get through it.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 98 wrong direction. But that's okay, because the longer they practice their fingertip-feeler-plotting, the better they will get at recognizing when things tend to go "off the rails." What they need is practice in subjective-decider writing. Not a class on objective-decider writing.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 99 Some of us have a combination of these traits, as well. The continuum has all points between the two extremes. So some of us will be primarily objective with some subjective, or vice versa. And of course, there are writers out there who are half and half. It’s really important to know what parts of your success process to trust, and when to reach for the right tool.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 100 There are certain coordinates that need to be plugged in, and then the computer will find its way through the story on its own. You can refine the computer over time--by learning more about structure maybe, or by getting a developmental edit on your work and figuring out where you typically go wrong--but drawing maps is not going to help you.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 112 anytime anyone has labeled you (or themselves) in a way that’s only meant to make you feel bad about yourself as a way to motivate you, you need to ask the following question: Am I motivated by negativity?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 113 if it’s the second, then you are not being motivated by the self-talk. The point is to motivate you. This clearly isn’t working. Find a new thought. Disagree with this sentence.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 116 What if the answer is, instead, to do what’s always made you successful, but do more of it? What if thinking really is the way to get unstuck for you? Or taking a break? Or reading a book? Or (gasp!) playing a video game?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 117 If you are blocked because you haven’t had enough “fallow” time, or your “bread-maker” needs more time to process, then you have to find the best and most efficient way to allow your fallow-ness to happen, or for your bread-maker to make its product. This often means letting go of the expectation that you “should” do any of the “common-sense” things that we suggest to break blocks.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 118 If you are blocked because your well is dry, you have to fill the well. Period. You’re going to come back to me and ask, “is this enough” after you’ve done it for awhile, and I’m going to say, “are you unstuck?” If you’re not unstuck, then, no, it’s not enough. (Again, if the dry well is the problem, this is the fix.)

Highlight (Yellow) Page 118 If you are blocked because there’s not peace in your environment, then you need to find as much peace as you can, or address the source of the non-peace with precision. No, it’s not going to go away on its own. You may have to do something about it. That “something” might be decluttering. It might be moving furniture. It might be a lot of different environmental tweaks that are specific to your environment. But if it’s physical-space related, then you have to address that. If you are blocked because something changed in your system, you might have to find a new system. (Or find a way to reclaim some parts of the old system.) Ask yourself, when was it working the best? And how to I replicate any part of that?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 119 If you are blocked because of pressure (you’re frozen because you’re not making enough money), and none of the above have worked for you in the past, then I highly recommend trying to relieve the pressure. It might be time to get a part-time job to recover some income. It might be time to get help in the form of a team, or in the form of emotional/therapeutic support.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 119 If you’re blocked because you’re afraid of how fans will respond to a book, you may need to talk to someone about that (I always suggest therapy, but coaches can be good here, if it’s not too close to the therapy/coach line). This is not an easy situation to be in, and don’t assume you can just epiphany your way out of this one.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 119 If you’re blocked because you’re afraid, work on what we talked about in the last chapter. Deconstructing that fear. Yes, it’s fine to have fear still present, as long as it’s not fight-or-flight fear. Because you can’t fight your manuscript. You have to be in a non-adrenaline place to enter the creative process. So we need to get you out of that place. Don’t be afraid to reach out for therapy there,

Highlight (Yellow) Page 120 The second strategy is: do one small thing. Instead of trying to do everything, instead of trying to write the whole book, instead of trying to do all the strategies… just do one.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 120 The third strategy is: reach out for help. A lot of us don’t like talking about writer’s block, and we for-sure don’t like admitting that we are blocked. We do a lot of free “group” coaching sessions for writers on our Better-Faster Academy Facebook page. There’s almost always one scheduled for the future. Come and ask us a question about your specific block. Or go to one of the many (many) writing coaches who are well known for doing good work and getting people unstuck. There’s more of a chance that they’ll be able to customize the advice they give you to your unique situation, and not that they’re just spouting what worked for them. I highly recommend coaching, if you can, when you’re in writer’s block. And a lot of coaches will have low-cost introductory calls where they can help you, as an individual.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 14 More than ever, we need to find ways to bring some of those thought trains (the worry, the preparation, the constant vigilance) into the certainty station. We need to develop ways to cope with extra vigilance (not just about the pandemic, because that’s only one set of traumatic events… there are more, and there will be more).

Highlight (Yellow) Page 14 If you are a person who finds certainty in work and in being busy, then I hope that you will allow yourself to do the hard work and to focus and lock in to what you want to accomplish.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 15 We need to be more conscious about what brings us certainty. The more constant the stress, the more important this is. And specifically, we need to look for certainty in places other than the uncertain.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 15 I encourage you to look back on how you have been resilient in the past. How have you gotten through things? Who have you turned to? Who have you followed? Who have you placed trust in? Who has brought you comfort? It’s time to turn to those places again.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 15 The danger in times of stress is that we want to isolate. Especially those of us who are hyper-competent. If you need support, please find it.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 31 If you are a person who consistently needs momentum in order to move, and you can tell the difference between the times when you do have momentum and when you don’t, then you’re going to have to stair-step your way up out of the inert-ness of “inaction” block. Remind yourself that momentum takes canalization, and go back to the pattern you’d had in the past. (Waking up at the certain time or sitting down

Highlight (Yellow) Page 32 If you tend not to need momentum in order to act (you can act by catalyst, on your own power), then I want you to open the manuscript and write the sentence: “and then everything changed.” If that’s not right, then erase it and write something else. But often, with inaction block, it just takes that catalyst of putting the words down to unstick.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 32 Some people need quite a bit of pressure to get the words out. This tends to happen when the brain needs a lot of “thinking” time in order to progress, or when a person is an extreme external processor (verbal processor).

Highlight (Yellow) Page 33 When you have too many things going on, there’s often an excess of pressure from a source other than the writing. If you can’t deconstruct that pressure, then you have to find a way (like a preorder deadline or a paid editorial deadline that can’t be changed) to create the pressure.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 33 When your brain needs pressure, it doesn’t always have to be long-term, painful pressure. Sometimes, it can be as easy as being forced to talk about the book with someone else. The pressure of the dialogue can help to create that pressure.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 34 Narrow the stimulation. Write before you get on social media. Write before you talk to friends. Write before you open yourself to all the stimulation. This type of “stuck” can also sometimes need to externally process (a lot of highly distractible people are also external processors), so I would make sure to put that on your Stuck List.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 36 When you don’t have a skill, you can’t use it. If you’ve never developed the ability to compartmentalize (and I’m just gonna say: some of us are uniquely wired not to be able to compartmentalize already), you’re not magically going to be able to compartmentalize when you’re moving across the country and need to be able to learn how to write during that kind of instability.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 36 if you tend to get proximity stuck, on a regular basis, and find that your Stuck List is going to look at lot like “get through the time of instability,” then I highly recommend working on a program that’s designed to increase skills around anxiety, obsessive thinking, etc. I always recommend the behavioral training programs because they’re the most effective for long-term change (CBT, DBT, EBT), but even just developing a skill like the Five Second Rule can go a long way to coping with the “stuck” feeling.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 38 The next time you’re stuck, do “business as usual.” Let yourself have the distractions. Don’t change anything. Note at the end of each day, how much progress you made. Specifically, we’re looking for “do I see the story more now” and we’re looking for additional clarity about how to proceed.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 38 Then, we’re going to experiment with the fast. You’re stuck. Each morning, hide the phone (and don’t reach for the phone), keep an awareness for not opening apps. (Maybe use Freedom or something similar to cancel the option of even connecting with the apps/sites.) Work as long as you can inside the manuscript. When you need to think, get up and walk away—do something else like dishes or going for a drive or taking a shower. No digital distractions. This is fast week. Keep track of your metrics at the end of each day.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 43 Your ability to see problems in your own manuscript makes you over-conscious of the mistakes you’re making to such a point that you can’t see the fixes.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 47 Many of us have brains that also need to be fallow after we write (or in the middle of the writing process). This is incredibly inconvenient. But consider whether or not you meet the following criteria:

Highlight (Yellow) Page 47 You find yourself more motivated to write after you’ve had a drive, a shower, or a day of housework.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 49 The “plot block” kind of block is just that. What you’ve got planned isn’t going to work, or you can’t see what’s coming next. If you think of a horizontal scale, with “plotter” on one side, and “pantser” on the other side, the closer you are to “pants-ing” on that scale, the more likely you will get plot blocked.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 49 You see too many potential scaffolds being built on top of the plot you’ve already constructed and they’re making your thinking top-heavy. You need to strategically collapse some of those potential options. (This may sometimes require verbal processing.) Some of them absolutely won’t work, but you need to attack collapsing them with storytelling logic.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 50 You’re missing a critical piece of information that will help you to know what your character needs to do in the future of the book. This is almost always a “research” thing. You’ve got to go searching for the right piece of information to slide into that little keyhole that will make the door open.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 50 You’ve subconsciously made the wrong decision just before you stopped (or you’re about to make the wrong decision just after, in the story). It might be as simple as going out the wrong door, so as to meet the wrong person, so as to change the plot in a less high-stakes direction. Almost

Highlight (Yellow) Page 50 always, this subconscious awareness has to do with the stakes. You’ve somehow kneecapped the stakes. You’re not aware of it. But you have to follow that thread to its logical conclusion to be able to see what’s gone wrong. Again, this often requires feedback of some kind (either someone asking you questions like a beta reader or an editor), or a plot bunny hunter or book coach. It might require out-loud processing, or it might not.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 51 Typically, this kind of block is serendipitous. It comes with just the right scaffold collapse or just the right key of information or just the right road block.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 51 When you reach parts of your book that may not be as exciting to you (you’ve already had to plan them out, you already see what happens, you’ve already had that initial blast of the cool idea, and now it’s just down to execution), you’re more likely to shut down. You’re likely to become almost completely blocked.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 52 Unfortunately, there is not. (Although I have seen Trailblazer writers play games with themselves where they try to come up with a better idea than the one they’ve already had, and it does occasionally work. But sometimes you really need to execute things the way you saw them.)

Highlight (Yellow) Page 52 sometimes, this block can only be solved by time. What I typically recommend for this kind of block is to stop trying for the day, do whatever you can do to give yourself time away from the manuscript. Watch or read something stimulating and new. Then, very first thing the next morning, open the manuscript and make a deal with yourself that you’ll just try to write 100 words. It might not happen right away, but focus on the sparkly parts and write towards those. It’ll feel significantly better. And whenever possible, do skip the boring parts.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 59 Some of us have been burned out on an emotional or spiritual level for much longer than just this year (and to those of us, I say, bless you, because everyone should have a lot more compassion for you after 2020). So talking about “2020” is not to say that any of this burnout is new. But the collective awareness of it (across all sectors of the world) is fairly new. Or, let’s say, new-ish.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 67 We’ve been doing some interesting experiments in the Strengths for Writers (and our secret alumni) Facebook group recently. A few of writers have been trying to intentionally mark what brings them pennies. Go to the group and look for the “energy pennies” posts by Stefanie London, Kelsey Browning, and Kate Holdsworth. (Or just search for “energy pennies” and all of those posts will come up, as well.)

Highlight (Yellow) Page 127 Decision Trees are step-by-step yes-or-no questions where each “yes” answer has an outcome and each “no” answer has an outcome. We use these a lot for developing the thinking skills associated with writing. “Do I see what happens next, yes or no?” If the answer is “yes,” then I put, “Sit down at the manuscript, put your hands on the keys, and start writing what I see.” If the answer is “no,” then I ask the next question. “Do I know the motivations for the characters in the scene?” If the answer is “yes,” then I have one action, and if the answer is “no,” then I have another action.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 145 I often see people making determinations about what to write next based on one post they saw in an author group, or one article they saw on someone’s blog, or one conversation on an author discord. They aren’t questioning the premise of any motives of posters or conversants.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 151 Here are a few examples. 1) When someone tells you they make six figures, is your first instinct to ask, “is that 100K in profits, or 100K in revenue?” 2) When someone tells you they are a bestseller, is your first instinct to ask, “was that just one time, or have you repeatedly hit lists? And which bestseller list?” 3) When someone tells you that they started a blog and it helped them sell books, is your first instinct to look at how similar your platform and timing is to theirs? Or is your first instinct to start a blog, too? 4) When someone says you have to be on social media, is your first instinct to question how effective individual platforms are for actually selling? Are you likely to look at a multitude of different sources to find out whether certain platforms are better for others? Or are you signing up for every platform and taking classes on how to use them?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 152 The Waiting Period is a period of time you wait before you make a decision based on someone’s advice. It’s similar to The Automatic No (which is saying no to everything first, and then coming back 24 hours later with a yes if that’s what you decide eventually), but this is more about setting a waiting period for yourself. If the decision is driven by adrenaline, then the Waiting Period can be as short as 20 minutes (that’s how long it takes for the adrenaline spike to subside). Or if you really do need to remove yourself from the situation that’s requiring the decision, the Waiting Period might be 24 hours. It depends, from person to person. But set a designated waiting period for yourself, and then every time you feel that someone’s emotions are about to cause you to make a quick decision you may regret later, just enact The Waiting Period.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 153 Three keys to The Waiting Period. 1) Change your state. If you were sitting down, stand up. If you are in the car, pull over. If you are on the phone, hang up. If you are walking, sit down. Whatever your state is when you’ve been called to make the decision, change it. 2) Set a timer or set a reminder. Do not let yourself “wing” the timing. Otherwise, you’re going to come back before the time has expired. 3) Do something else in the meantime. Do not sit around waiting for the timer to pass. Do the laundry. Load the dishwasher. Pay the bills. Go for a walk. Read a book. Make dinner. Do something else while you wait for the timer to pass. As a general rule, don’t watch the timer. Wait for it to go off. Then, the Waiting Period is over.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 165 I went through an intensive therapy program fifteen years ago that lasted for eighteen months and included daily practice. It was an emotional maturity class and they called it “re-parenting” work. Essentially, we were teaching ourselves the skills that we hadn’t learned as children.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 168 some of us are not selling because we’re trying to write for the wrong people.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 170 Iteration. This is similar to the Acceptance tool, in the way it’s practiced. Iteration looks like accepting that what I’ve done hasn’t sold in the past, and the only way to correct what mistakes I’ve made is to iterate. Do the post-mortem. What wasn’t working. Then write the next book. Iterate.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 179 Boundaries. If you’re the type of person who hates to fail, and you’ve been seeing failure after failure and it’s starting to demoralize you, then I would set some boundaries for yourself about how much you’re going to invest. If you have limited resources, set yourself some expectations about how much you’re willing to lose on this hobby you’re wanting to turn into a side hustle. This is why the average “failed” business doesn’t last more than three years. Most people can’t afford to be in the red forever.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 179 If you are putting a lot of pressure on yourself to market correctly or to write to market correctly (which, again, not everyone should write to market, but just for the sake of argument, even when you’re not “trotting” to write to market, you can still write a marketable book), then sometimes, that pressure can break your creative process. (Read the book Big Magic if this resonates.) When this happens, you might want to consider doing an experimental R&D phase where you just write books under a pen name and spend no money and put

Highlight (Yellow) Page 25 many of us who are intuitive have developed a critical voice inside to protect us from the embarrassment of having to explain our intuition to people who are not intuitive.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 25 anyone who doesn’t know the feeling of intuition prodding at you is a potential candidate for making you feel you need to question intuition.)

Highlight (Yellow) Page 25 Not all internal voices are intuition. Some of them are learned coping mechanisms, designed to protect us or to help us or to promote success. We can’t just exile those parts (they’re still part of us), but we need to helpfully integrate them, and that can take long months or years of work. But it’s work that’s worth doing.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 26 Here’s what can happen if we need to differentiate between internal voices and don’t do the work: We might decide to start writing intuitively and then hit a stress spot and not be able to publish the book because the critical inner voice gets loud. We might get into the middle of an intuitive decision we’re trusting and find the internal pushback causes us to disconnect and lean heavily on coping mechanisms that push us farther from our creativity. We might still live with those critical voices on the outside, and not have the skills or the capacity to fight them off, no matter how brilliant our intuition might be.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 27 What I don’t want us to do is create internal instability by trying to follow intuition that will lead to more frozenness or more flight mechanisms.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 29 We are still allowed to Question the Premise (QTP) of others’ assertions. Because, of course, we all know those stubbornly ignorant people who yell, “I just know”

Highlight (Yellow) Page 29 The goal is to learn to trust our own intuition. Not to worry about anyone else’s.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 29 we hear how certain they are in those assertions, so we hold back on our own internal trust when we should just ignore them—when we should instead hone our trust of our intuition.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 40 Intellectual intuition is the ability to see patterns in thoughts (sometimes theirs, sometimes others’) and make meaning out of them without needing every specific part of the pattern laid out. This might mean an ability to see the pattern in someone’s thinking that would indicate a particular type of function or dysfunction. It might mean an ability to extrapolate thought patterns to solve philosophical conundrums. But it might also allow a person to see the thinking behind emotions.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 41 It’s not about feeling emotions. It’s about understanding thought patterns that drive behavior.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 43 When you can see a set of numbers and have an intuition about how to move them around or how to increase one part to make the whole better, or when you can see the natural relationships and patterns between the numbers, you have systemic intuition. You’re looking at a bounded set of data and connecting whatever missing pieces might be there, and then intuiting what needs to change.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 47 Her intellectual intuition allows her to seek out motivations and read behavior and tailor the story to the people as she discovers them. One of the very first things she said to me when we started coaching was, “I don’t know how I write each book.” (And she’s finished dozens of novels at this point.) Part of her journey as a professional writer has been to trust the intellectual intuition (the way she can read behavior and understand motivations), even when there’s a part of her intellectual brain that really wants to know the story ahead of time.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 62 When I am intuitive, and I can’t objectively prove my correctness to someone else with certainty (X on the graph), I mistrust my gut responses. I’m also more likely to believe someone else’s certainty, whether or not they are correct, when I have an internal lack of certainty.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 65 You don’t have to explain your intuition to anyone. You don’t have to justify its existence. If there are people in your life who don’t understand the way you make decisions, they shouldn’t be controlling your decision-making with their lack of understanding.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 65 your intuition might be wrong at times, but it won’t get more capable if you don’t exercise it. It won’t become smarter if you don’t trust it. If the fear of being wrong or the fear of failure is keeping you from trusting intuition, then I highly recommend working on that as your development project following reading this book. Increasing your ability to be wrong, or your ability to see failure as the path to success will pay off exponentially. This might be the most important skill an intuitive can possess.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 71 you will not become a better intuitive writer by outlining if you are a discovery writer.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 76 What is the key to having a plot in your book? Causality. All the plotting books agree, the key to a plot is cause-and-effect of some kind. The most common example that gets tossed around in plotting classes and books, about the difference between story and plot, is about the king and the queen. You’ve likely all heard it. “‘The king died, and the queen died’ is a story; ‘The king died, and the queen died of grief’ is a plot.” The “of grief” implies that the king’s death caused the queen’s death, and then there’s the implication that the queen’s death will cause something else to happen.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 79 no one is teaching intuitives how to be better intuitive writers. Everyone is teaching us how to plot, though.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 79 There is no such thing as plotting vs. pants-ing. There is only explicit plotting and intuitive plotting. Objective plotting and subjective plotting. One is outside the snow globe, one is inside. When you write, as an intuitive, you plot subconsciously (sometimes even semi-consciously), but you are still plotting.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 85 I see people who have an extremely high degree of unconscious competence, where they couldn’t teach you the skill they’re using, and where they cycle from Step Two (that unconscious competence) into Step Three (where they think they don’t know what they’re doing), and then try to learn how to do their process differently.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 87 When you have an intuitive brain, you have an autopilot computer. You put the data in, and the computer shows you the story. The computer gets honed over the years by consuming great stories and becoming aware of what you love about storytelling. It gets honed by getting feedback about what you’ve done that worked, and finding out what data you’re missing. It gets honed by iterating the process of writing and trying to get better at the individual skills where I can progress through the pyramid. Of course, the problem is, there is no manual for this computer.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 91 In Big Magic, author Elizabeth Gilbert lays out some beautiful theories about the creative process. One is the notion that an idea can be an entity unto itself, something that finds you and wants to work with you in order to take form in our world. Another notion is that genius isn’t something a person is, but a relationship one has with something outside themselves.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 92 seeing the creative process as a collaboration in that way can ease some pressure. If we feel allowed to wait for our Muse or helpful genius, we might feel freer to give ourselves the time we need to let our unconscious processes do their thing.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 93 I consider myself an immersive writer. That’s what I call writers who write not only from inside the snow globe, but from “inside the character suit.” They are feeling their way around their fictional world, while also experiencing that world as the character in a way similar to what’s described as “method acting.”

Highlight (Yellow) Page 96 Often, when we’re trying to find that middle ground between following who we are as sensitive intuitives, how our brains want to function in our creativity, and trying to find an audience and make a living, we’re directed right back to The Right Way to think, which is not our way. And when we try to follow the instructions and advice of our more concrete-thinking peers, often delivered with the best of intentions, we find ourselves stuck, blocked, and burned out.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 97 We find writers who have internalized messages about writing outlines and following a plan, who aren’t able to see when that plan is failing them.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 97 The original concept, idea, or even outline, which once gave them clarity simply needs to be re-jiggered, based on what they’ve learned about the characters and the world through living in it for a bit.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 98 What if the special kind of creativity employed by some intuitive people requires belief? In a similar way, possibly, to how positive attitude affects some medical outcomes? What if your belief in that magic, your faith and trust in your creative ability, is your tether to your Deep Well, that part of your consciousness where the truly special waits to be released?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 99 If you think back to who you were as a writer, before you decided to “become a writer” and learn how it’s done, what was different? What was easier? What was better?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 101 What if I can’t do it again? What if it won’t work this time? What if all those other books were flukes? If you knew how many writers feel this exact fear… and most of us can never admit this to anyone (except maybe a coach or our night stand). Even if it’s not quite this level of terror. Even if it’s that momentary, what if I can’t do this again? That’s still fear. When you’re good at something, but you don’t know how you’re good at it, the feeling disorients.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 102 The autopilot does exist. It may need some honing, or some training. It may need some conscious structure (for some of us). But often, what it really needs is better input and more practice. Autopilot works through data collection. There are sensors on all parts of the plane that feed data into the computer the whole flight long. So if the plane veers off course, the autopilot knows and can correct to stay on course. So that’s one part. Sensors. The coordinates (where we’re leaving from, and where we’re flying to) are another part. The computer sets a flight path that the sensors use to keep the plane on course. That’s the second part. Coordinates. And finally, there’s the pilot. Pilots have full control over the system if they want it. They can intentionally shut down autopilot and take control of the aircraft if they need to.1 That’s the third part. Vigilance.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 103 Sensors First, if you’re intuitive, you are constantly taking in data. You gather information and your subconscious brain makes connections between that information.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 106 we are all taking in stories to build our internal story sensor. (This is one of the reasons we encourage you to read the best books you can, or watch the best movies you can. Not “best” like the critics say they’re the best, but the “best” for your audience. The thing your audience wants to read.)

Highlight (Yellow) Page 106 Most intuitive writers can give you a list of things they learned not to do, when they were first writing. (Don’t start with backstory. Don’t write long paragraphs. Those were my first two.) That’s one type of sensor, too. Feedback from others. Most

Highlight (Yellow) Page 107 It’s possible to be a good (or great) writer with only your own internal story sensors as your guide. Or to employ some vigilance over what you do and don’t pay attention to. (Like selecting which of your editor’s developmental feedback to listen to.) So I don’t want to insist that you have to intentionally use all these data sets to hone your intuition.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 107 Do you need to be aware of the sensors? No. Do you need to be conscious of the data? No. You just need to be aware that the sensors are there, picking up the data about whether or not the scene / story / premise / character is compelling.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 109 Whenever I talk to intuitive writers about autopilot, someone inevitably says, “wow, I wish I could just know exactly where I’m going.” What they mean is, “I wish I could get a list of directions for where to drive on the map.” I would say, your autopilot does actually know where it’s going. It just doesn’t always tell you.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 110 There’s something about knowing the nuances of the character that will provide the “lock-in” for these writers. Typically, as they’re writing, they have to keep referring to the characters and who they are in order to solve plot problems. In fact, more often than not, any stuckness in a book can be solved by returning to the coordinates. Character coordinates might look like: Emotions in the scene Emotional arc throughout the book Conflicting motivations Character backstory Trajectory of character development What a character needs to learn Every character-driven writer connects with a slightly different manifestation of character coordinates.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 111 If you happen to use character coordinates to steer your autopilot, and you also outline, you need to give yourself permission to change the outline to suit who the characters become as you write the draft.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 114 Those of you who are stakes-first writers need to know what matters to a person before you can write them. What do they have to lose? What is on the line?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 115 When you need to know the stakes before you can write, you are often looking for the central conflict or the central dilemma that the story revolves around. Once you know the stakes (what’s at stake for each character), the conflict builds itself. One wins for awhile, the other wins for awhile, and then there’s a big showdown.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 119 We can’t turn off our autopilot intuition completely, but we can “switch to manual” for a length of time. Often, this happens unintentionally.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 120 I’ve Done Something Wrong But I Don’t Know What

Highlight (Yellow) Page 121 When this type of don’t-know-what’s-wrong intuition happens, there will always be a fix that presents itself once you start digging in. It will often be a painful process

Highlight (Yellow) Page 121 Almost always, I need to dig deep into what I’ve just written, have someone throw ideas at me for how to fix it, and shoot most of them down.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 121 What I’ve found to be true for almost all writers who get to this place is that there’s a particular type of intuition coordinate (character, ending, turning point, stakes, etc.) that’s causing the glitch. Typically, knowing which one drives your orientation will help. The real key for this type: It’s okay not to know.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 125 Questions to ask: “Has ‘just writing through it’ worked for me in the past?” and “What’s my first instinct?”

Highlight (Yellow) Page 125 I Need to Know What Happened This is an offshoot of something-is-wrong-but-I-don’t-know-where vigilance. Typically, when you feel the “something’s wrong” feeling, your immediate response will be to look all the way forward or all the way backward. (What happened to them before the book started, or how is this going to end?)

Highlight (Yellow) Page 125 Knowing motivation from the start won’t stop this from happening, because the motivation you think they have and the motivation they show you will often be different.1

Highlight (Yellow) Page 127 Questions to ask: “Have I gone back and read a couple of chapters?” and “Do I need to go back to the beginning of the book?”

Highlight (Yellow) Page 128 One Of These Details Is Wrong

Highlight (Yellow) Page 128 You might need to read a book (research or another fiction book). Maybe watch a documentary. Or open the (gasp!) internet to research.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 129 Questions to ask: “Is there something I need to research?” and “Is there a nagging question I need to answer about the character?”

Highlight (Yellow) Page 129 some writers will switch back and forth between different types of vigilance even within the same book. The key isn’t that you have to be one type. They key is diagnosing what’s going on so you can get through the stoppage quicker.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 132 The other 5/8 of writers bounce back and forth between needing to know something and needing to know nothing. This segment is the hardest place to be when you’re first starting off because you’re never sure just how much to plot and how much not to. Often, those of us in the “middle” of the extremes have to do a lot of experimentation about how much information we need and don’t need. Therefore, our process can change almost from book to book while we discover how much we need to know.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 136 Some may actually loathe the idea of going back and editing. Typically, we see a few major reasons why that loathing happens. You’re not in the stream anymore, so the immersion in the story isn’t the same the second time through. You’re afraid you’ve made major mistakes that will require major rewrites. You’re afraid you didn’t follow the rules and you don’t want to face the extreme process of forcing your book to follow the rules. When the dislike of editing comes from a place of fear-of-mistakes, we try to coach a growth mindset.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 137 This is where we need to differentiate between intuition and skill.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 138 When it’s intuition, it will be backed up by personality alignment. It will be backed up by a desire to find more certainty about what happens next. It will be supported by a desire to make sure you do justice to the story or the characters. We’ll see a need to process more deeply or to think over something. Intuition is always backed up by something you don’t know.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 139 Not wanting to edit is often an intuitive goal misalignment with the goals of editing. When it’s intuition, it will be backed up by not caring how someone else thinks the books hit. It will be supported by a lack of desire to do it ‘right” according to an external standard or by a knowledge that I’ve done what needs to be done in the story and it doesn’t need to be changed. We’ll see a comfort with the books selling however they’re going to sell. “I’ve done it the way I want to do it.” That’s what it sounds like when intuition is at play.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 140 Some intuitive writers genuinely can’t get back into the stream of the book once they’ve told the story the first time. They’re not interested in thinking about whether or not they made the right choices, and they can’t get re-immersed in the story in the same way. They’re also generally okay with however the books do without major edits. (This isn’t to say they don’t proofread or maybe even do line edits, but they’re not interested in revisions, major edits, or outside opinions about whether or not their stories are correct.)

Highlight (Yellow) Page 140 But more often, the last two reasons (afraid of major mistakes, or a dislike of doing major revision work) are the more common reasons we see intuitive writers not liking editing.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 141 If we assume that intuition is “just knowing” without knowing how you know, then the immersive writing process plays into that strength of intuition. When I try to force myself into awareness about “why” I made a decision, that’s the opposite of letting the autopilot run. Suddenly, I’m in unfamiliar territory. If I can’t know why I made a choice, how can I unmake it? How will I know what to do?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 142 Their intuition knows what needs to change, but that resistance is there because rhetorical questions cause thought spirals and then we decide there’s a lion at the mouth of the

Highlight (Yellow) Page 142 editing is one of the best ways to hone your intuition. When we talk more at the end of the book about strategies to hone intuition, one of the first ones we discuss is editing.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 142 When you can see where your intuition was leading you in one direction, you can start to help your autopilot ask better questions on the way through the draft the first time.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 143 Trying to force intuition into a rule box is not teaching intuition how to be more intuitive.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 143 There are still guiding principles to how your intuition can create story, but it won’t look like, “at 25%, you’d better have this and at 50%, you’d better have this.” It will look like, “is something compelling happening here?” Or, “Is this scene moving the story forward?” Or, “Is there still tension here?” Or, “Do I still want to keep reading? If not, why not?” Understanding the answers to the big-picture questions is more likely to help you hone your intuition than learning how to apply rules backwards to an intuitively written story.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 145 Following rules can trip up intuition. Following coordinates (I should have stakes shifting… how long has it been since the stakes shifted?) is intuition.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 145 If we’re intuitive, or if we’re abstract, or if we’re big-picture, we want to edit for intuitive concepts, abstract concepts, or big-picture concepts. We want to edit for coordinates. Are my characters making compelling choices that create conflict (internal or external)? Are the stakes high enough? Do they have enough to lose (internally or externally—not all stories are the same balance of those two)? Are my threads getting tied up and opened? Are there open threads somewhere that I could be touching? Am I pushing the action forward? Am I complicating things or raising stakes or changing trajectory?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 146 Every type of intuition coordinate has a different set of questions they’ll want to ask of themselves. Each of those examples of questions are things I will routinely pull out to ask writers if they’re headed back into revisions. Rather than focusing on rules or structure, I try to focus with intuitive writers on the coordinates that guide them through the story. If they are character driven, we focus on characters and their feelings and motivations. If they are plot driven, we focus on turning points and raising stakes. If they are sense-of-place writers, we focus on the environment and the events.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 147 if editing causes fear because you’re afraid you don’t follow the rules, stop using that editing process. Find your coordinates instead, and find your vigilance areas, and work to your own set of rules. Not an arbitrary set of rules.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 148 becoming better at intuition is about building the three parts of your autopilot. Continuing to push good data at your sensors. Honing how you feed your coordinates. Strategically engaging your vigilance.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 149 How To Develop Your Sensors This is the place where we generally want the least amount of awareness of data. Most of the time, pressing too hard on “what data am I taking in” will overwhelm. The more intuitive we are, our best sensor-interpretation ability is subconscious. Not conscious.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 149 Keep watching movies or shows. Keep reading good books. Keep consuming story. Keep looking at your own story. Keep researching. Keep thinking about your characters or discovering more about them. Keep feeding yourself the data or processing the data how you normally process it. Even. If. You. Also. Enjoy. These. Activities. They. Are. Still. Work.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 150 we can also start reminding our wise self that we do need to feed our sensors. That means consuming good story. In any medium that works for you. Build the sensors.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 151 How To Develop Your Coordinates

Highlight (Yellow) Page 151 pick out all the types of coordinates you’ve used in the past. Copy those descriptions or the questions onto a piece of paper (or use the Stuck List workbook we discussed earlier2). Keep that accessible as you write and plan. Coordinates are the place in your autopilot where you can have a bit more awareness, because they’re often the reason you get stuck. Knowing what questions to ask when you’re stuck is the big key to developing your intuition.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 151 Becoming better at honing your coordinates might mean: Phoning a friend more quickly. Walking away from the computer faster. Writing about writing without the “I give up” moment. Going to research the thing I keep trying to avoid researching. Leaving the house faster. Tracking back to read what you’ve already written without it being the last resort.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 152 How To Interpret Your Vigilance

Highlight (Yellow) Page 153 go into the descriptions from the Vigilance Types chapter and make notes about which ones really resonated for you. When you see yourself following a common pattern, it’s so much more likely that the fix we outline for that pattern will work for you.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 160 not everyone can write to market, period. Some of us have internal sensors that are not related to any reader feedback or editorial feedback. We’re just writing to please ourselves. So when our interest or what we believe is a compelling story overlaps with what the market wants to read, we sell. And when those interests don’t overlap, we don’t sell as well

Highlight (Yellow) Page 162 When you’re primarily interested in what makes you happy, it’s not worth trying to turn that off so you can write to market. It’s a much better alignment to find the market where the books you like are selling. Not everyone will want to (or do well when they) write to market.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 168 watch your intake. If you’re searching out information all the time about how you are wrong in what you’re doing, you’re going to find it. I guarantee. Sometimes, it’s more important to shut down intake for your sanity than it is for you to find what might or might not be wrong right now. The third thing I’d suggest is: try just trusting.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 168 Experiment with your intuition and see what produces the best results. It’s genuinely difficult to build trust in intuition if you’re not willing to let it be right and be wrong.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 170 When your vigilance is unstudied (you don’t know the places to pull back and the places not to), you’re almost always early in your career. Typically, the people in the previous subheading (your vigilance is confused) are farther into their career. That’s the primary differentiator.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 170 Yes, learning can be helpful. But if you’re intuitive, nothing will be as helpful as iteration.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 175 Having a platform as an intuitive can be overwhelming because everyone is telling us what we should do and where we should be and even when it conflicts with our intuition about what we want and don’t want, we might follow the advice because we can’t be certain they’re not correct.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 175 Running a platform as an intuitive author has to take two things into account: 1) the potential for diminishing returns 2) the internal hesitation or catalyzing

Highlight (Yellow) Page 177 If you would identify has an HSP, limiting your access to social media becomes even more important (and email, potentially), because the more people’s emotions you’re exposed to, the less in control of your own thought trains you are.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 178 When intuitive people talk about getting a gut feeling they shouldn’t do something, that hesitation is always worth exploring. I

Highlight (Yellow) Page 179 Because this internal limiter (the hesitation) can often have buried reasons like that, it can be difficult to trust them. But there’s always a reason. (Not everyone needs to know the reason, of course, but when you’re questioning the premise, you really do need to know the reason. Because if that had really been true, if they really hadn’t liked going to new places, then that trip would have been a bad idea. Plus, sometimes the internal limiter is putting together other pieces of data, thinks it’s not conscious of, and it really can’t tell the reason.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 181 The less I want to do something (for any particular reason), the less likely I am to be wildly successful at it.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 190 So this part (when to take the wheel, and when not to follow a system) becomes the most complicated question of all to answer. When am I failing because I haven’t learned enough yet? When am I failing because something needs to change? When am I failing because I need to not advertise these books?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 192 Make sure the person is a patient-with-questions person. You absolutely need to be able to ask questions of an expert when you’re an intuitive. You’ll catch some things very quickly, and some things not as quickly. Patience is key and willingness to answer questions.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 197 What is your job, writing books? What purpose are we aligning you to?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 198 To Fulfill a Childhood Dream So many of us were readers as children and decided we wanted to be writers because of the stories we consumed.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 198 Alignment with this dream often looks like stubbornness or resilience. The “but I’ve always known I would do this” feeling that makes you continue to learn or experiment or publish, even when the results aren’t showing what would fulfill the dream.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 199 To Tell The Stories So many authors know what it’s like to have characters in our heads, talking to us. Either we’re telling their stories compulsively, because we can’t not, or we want to tell the stories intentionally, because the process of telling stories is so much fun.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 202 To Write Great Books

Highlight (Yellow) Page 203 we’d discussed how important it was that the books were as good as they could be. Not just good enough, but as good as they could be. That’s a very different standard from minimum viable product (and minimum viable product works very well for a lot of people… just not for everyone). For some writers, writing great books requires a whole different type of alignment, business-wise, from other purposes. It might require more time or more edit rounds. It might require more thought or more ideas. (And yes, it’s possible to write great books without them taking forever… this is not quality over quantity. It’s about alignment.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 204 Given the goal of “great books,” they were as productive as they could possibly be. It wasn’t a waste of time to focus on quality, for them, because that was the promise they made to their readers.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 206 Generally speaking, when you’ve learned a system and it isn’t working, it’s the wrong system for you. You’re not doing it wrong. (I mean, in theory, you might be failing to execute parts of the plan, but it’s not likely that more work will help execute better.) When your intuition is screaming at you that it’s the wrong fit, scream back at the part that says, “but we have to do it this way.”

Highlight (Yellow) Page 222 If a person isn’t willing to step inside the snow globe with you and believe you are right about what you see, they are not worth listening to. For intuitives, or really, for anyone. But especially for intuitives.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 232 bringing someone inside your snow globe is the best way to listen to business advice. Having someone you trust (whoever that person is) to help you interpret the data coming at you will be one of the most important investments of your time you can make. It’s also why we encourage people to seek out author friends who are similar to you and who have similar goals and who you click with. Having people to help you understand what’s going on inside your mind and inside your slow globe is priceless. Find your village.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 243 In order to truly move past the situation, we have to accept the fact that we didn’t know something, or that our intuition missed something. We do want to be curious about how the “missing it” happened. Typically, when we work through this in coaching, we’re looking for the data that our sensors were picking up. What was making me believe this was a good idea? Was I not casting a wide enough research net? Was I afraid of failure? Was I listening to a particular person who doesn’t have my best interests at heart? Was I trusting certainty = correct? What was the cause of the intuitive failure? The more compassion I can have for my past selves and how they handled things at their best, the more quickly I can move past the failure and into the learning curve.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 243 Here’s what acceptance looks like. Let’s use the example of I should have released better. Okay, what factors contributed to the release? Other than, of course, everyone else’s releases, world politics and economics, complex algorithms, reader preferences/moods, and all the other factors out of your control?1 And then, what was in my control? Which factors of those are in my control? Realistically. Which factors of those are realistic to expect? (If

Highlight (Yellow) Page 246 It may seem strange to think that there’s a part of you that needs forgiveness from another part of you, but that’s exactly what has to happen when intuition is wrong. We have to see that little part of ourselves that was doing its best and bring it back into the fold. Keeping it outside in the rain isn’t going to do anything. It needs to be forgiven and integrated. Moving forward, the intuition has to feel like you trust it again. As a collective, you need to know which data to trust and which data to seek out, yes. You do want to learn from the experience. But, absolutely, re-integrate the intuition after the acceptance, so you can move forward with intuition on your team again.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 247 Strategize Now that you’re all on the same team again, it’s important to strategize about how not to end up in that place again. If there are groups or people you need to stop listening to, make that happen. If there are markers to be on the lookout for, keep vigilant. But most of the time, what happened in the past won’t replicate itself, so the biggest strategy we can implement is moving forward with trust in the intuition. No more punishing. No more past-excavating. Forgiveness, and forward motion.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 248 Find Intuitive-Friendly Environments A huge part of teaching your intuition how to be smarter is about who you surround yourself with (because your sensors are always taking in the data of the people around you). When people understand intuition and are supportive of it, you’re in an intuitive-friendly environment.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 249 She said, “You need to find someone who knows you really well, and who tends to give you advice based on what they know about you, and will ask questions where they don’t know.” This is the intuitive-friendly environment. It is essential, when you hone your intuition, that you surround yourself with people who believe you. People who will step inside your snow globe and listen to what you have to say and believe your intuition.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 250 The intuitive-friendly response is not, “But you don’t have experience.” It is not, “But you don’t know that for sure.” It is not, “But it goes against every best practice we know.” It is not, “show your work,” in that power-over, condescending voice. It sounds more like, “I wonder why your intuition went there,” in a curious, friendly, let-the-deer-come-to-you voice.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 251 just because she liked me or because I was trying to be helpful, those weren’t good enough reasons for her to keep being coached by me if my natural coaching style was making her question her intuition.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 253 Sometimes, you need baby steps, and sometimes, you need leaps. And sometimes, you just need to survive and get through. In order to hone your intuition, you need to become more aware of what you need in order to be at your best. When you are in a time of life that is exceptionally difficult, and your body and mind lock up if you don’t feel safe, then you need safety. When you are in a learning curve, you might need baby steps, or a step backward. And when you need challenges, you need challenges.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 255 with writers, I see two very opposite extremes in this part of intuition honing. 1) Blaming others when it’s my fault. 2) Blaming myself when it was out of my control. Very rarely do I see these two together. Most of us trend heavily toward one or the other.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 264 Living the intuitive life, from here on out, is all about living as though your intuition is your superpower. It means creating environments that are intuition-friendly. It means making space for intuition to happen unhindered. It means shutting down sources of input that are damaging your intuitive ability to function. It means nurturing your ability. It means taking action when you feel an intuitive push. For some of us, that will mean making space for more silence. For others, it will mean making space for more action.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 265 The second time you read, go in with a notebook. Underline every action step that appeals to you. Write them in the notebook. If that natural sorting process didn’t already happen, then start sorting them. What feels like the most important first step to take?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 266 If your intuition is hurting because it’s been wrong, take the time to walk through the steps to get to forgiveness. It’ll be worth the re-integration with your intuitive voice.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 266 So, so, so many of us who are intuitive need more space, as a general rule. Either we need more time to think or process, or we need more space from people whose emotions are big, or we need more freedom to go deeper into the story, or we need to stop getting all the voices confusing our intuition. If this is you, please make the space. Shut down the inputs. Get out of the environments.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 268 The intuitive life has no concrete external road map. The road map is internal and subconscious. Connect with other intuitive writers. Find a safe space. Hone that intuition.
