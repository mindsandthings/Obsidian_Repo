Possible action items - Becca Syme notes

"Alignment is symmetry between your self and your systems. Between your purpose, your personality, your platform, your capacity, and your goals."

- Journal on these

"If a person does their best work when they process information over and over in their head before it comes out of their fingers onto the page (or their mouth, if they’re speaking), why are we trying to short-circuit that process?"

"First, I want you to think of your favorite books. I want you to quantify, as much as you are able, what you love about them. What keeps you going back? Make that list. I want you to see, by and large, how you talk about what you love about books."

Highlight (Yellow) Page 118 If you are highly driven, you might need to do a lot of small tasks that have been piling up and going undone so you could "do the more important writing work". All of that pile is creating cognitive dissonance, just sitting there undone. Take some time to address the pile. The “small wins” will help give you energy to build your ladder.

**Highlight (Yellow) Page 120 If you are highly success-oriented, you have to surround yourself with people who reframe your self-confidence for you. Take yourself out of situations where you feel a lack of confidence. Put yourself into situations where you are reminded of how good you are and how what you're doing is right. Cut out the places that don't support this message. (And listen to me carefully here:) No. Matter. Where. They. Come. From. And. No. Matter. How. Hard. It. Will. Be.**

Highlight (Yellow) Page 121 Quick note to those of you who have taken the CliftonStrengths® assessment. There are special hacks to building ladder rungs when you know your Strengths. With any Strength, look at the list of qualities from your report. Those are the things that give you energy. Do those things.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 141 Commit to one or two things that will bring you energy pennies. Many of us can’t handle much more than that. The inertia of our lives can’t take a complete overhaul. But if you limit the “make pennies” to one or two things, then you are more likely to be doing them in sixty days.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 112 anytime anyone has labeled you (or themselves) in a way that’s only meant to make you feel bad about yourself as a way to motivate you, you need to ask the following question: Am I motivated by negativity?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 49 The “plot block” kind of block is just that. What you’ve got planned isn’t going to work, or you can’t see what’s coming next. If you think of a horizontal scale, with “plotter” on one side, and “pantser” on the other side, the closer you are to “pants-ing” on that scale, the more likely you will get plot blocked.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 50 You’re missing a critical piece of information that will help you to know what your character needs to do in the future of the book. This is almost always a “research” thing. You’ve got to go searching for the right piece of information to slide into that little keyhole that will make the door open.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 50 You’ve subconsciously made the wrong decision just before you stopped (or you’re about to make the wrong decision just after, in the story). It might be as simple as going out the wrong door, so as to meet the wrong person, so as to change the plot in a less high-stakes direction. 

Highlight (Yellow) Page 50 always, this subconscious awareness has to do with the stakes. You’ve somehow kneecapped the stakes. You’re not aware of it. But you have to follow that thread to its logical conclusion to be able to see what’s gone wrong. Again, this often requires feedback of some kind (either someone asking you questions like a beta reader or an editor), or a plot bunny hunter or book coach. It might require out-loud processing, or it might not.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 51 When you reach parts of your book that may not be as exciting to you (you’ve already had to plan them out, you already see what happens, you’ve already had that initial blast of the cool idea, and now it’s just down to execution), you’re more likely to shut down. You’re likely to become almost completely blocked.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 52 Unfortunately, there is not. (Although I have seen Trailblazer writers play games with themselves where they try to come up with a better idea than the one they’ve already had, and it does occasionally work. But sometimes you really need to execute things the way you saw them.)

Highlight (Yellow) Page 127 Decision Trees are step-by-step yes-or-no questions where each “yes” answer has an outcome and each “no” answer has an outcome. We use these a lot for developing the thinking skills associated with writing. “Do I see what happens next, yes or no?” If the answer is “yes,” then I put, “Sit down at the manuscript, put your hands on the keys, and start writing what I see.” If the answer is “no,” then I ask the next question. “Do I know the motivations for the characters in the scene?” If the answer is “yes,” then I have one action, and if the answer is “no,” then I have another action.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 152 The Waiting Period is a period of time you wait before you make a decision based on someone’s advice. It’s similar to The Automatic No (which is saying no to everything first, and then coming back 24 hours later with a yes if that’s what you decide eventually), but this is more about setting a waiting period for yourself. If the decision is driven by adrenaline, then the Waiting Period can be as short as 20 minutes (that’s how long it takes for the adrenaline spike to subside). Or if you really do need to remove yourself from the situation that’s requiring the decision, the Waiting Period might be 24 hours. It depends, from person to person. But set a designated waiting period for yourself, and then every time you feel that someone’s emotions are about to cause you to make a quick decision you may regret later, just enact The Waiting Period.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 153 Three keys to The Waiting Period. 1) Change your state. If you were sitting down, stand up. If you are in the car, pull over. If you are on the phone, hang up. If you are walking, sit down. Whatever your state is when you’ve been called to make the decision, change it. 2) Set a timer or set a reminder. Do not let yourself “wing” the timing. Otherwise, you’re going to come back before the time has expired. 3) Do something else in the meantime. Do not sit around waiting for the timer to pass. Do the laundry. Load the dishwasher. Pay the bills. Go for a walk. Read a book. Make dinner. Do something else while you wait for the timer to pass. As a general rule, don’t watch the timer. Wait for it to go off. Then, the Waiting Period is over.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 170 Iteration. This is similar to the Acceptance tool, in the way it’s practiced. Iteration looks like accepting that what I’ve done hasn’t sold in the past, and the only way to correct what mistakes I’ve made is to iterate. Do the post-mortem. What wasn’t working. Then write the next book. Iterate.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 179 Boundaries. If you’re the type of person who hates to fail, and you’ve been seeing failure after failure and it’s starting to demoralize you, then I would set some boundaries for yourself about how much you’re going to invest.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 179 If you are putting a lot of pressure on yourself to market correctly or to write to market correctly (which, again, not everyone should write to market, but just for the sake of argument, even when you’re not “trotting” to write to market, you can still write a marketable book), then sometimes, that pressure can break your creative process. (Read the book Big Magic if this resonates.) When this happens, you might want to consider doing an experimental R&D phase where you just write books under a pen name and spend no money and put

Highlight (Yellow) Page 25 Not all internal voices are intuition. Some of them are learned coping mechanisms, designed to protect us or to help us or to promote success. We can’t just exile those parts (they’re still part of us), but we need to helpfully integrate them, and that can take long months or years of work. But it’s work that’s worth doing.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 26 Here’s what can happen if we need to differentiate between internal voices and don’t do the work: We might decide to start writing intuitively and then hit a stress spot and not be able to publish the book because the critical inner voice gets loud. We might get into the middle of an intuitive decision we’re trusting and find the internal pushback causes us to disconnect and lean heavily on coping mechanisms that push us farther from our creativity. We might still live with those critical voices on the outside, and not have the skills or the capacity to fight them off, no matter how brilliant our intuition might be.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 27 What I don’t want us to do is create internal instability by trying to follow intuition that will lead to more frozenness or more flight mechanisms.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 40 Intellectual intuition is the ability to see patterns in thoughts (sometimes theirs, sometimes others’) and make meaning out of them without needing every specific part of the pattern laid out. This might mean an ability to see the pattern in someone’s thinking that would indicate a particular type of function or dysfunction. It might mean an ability to extrapolate thought patterns to solve philosophical conundrums. But it might also allow a person to see the thinking behind emotions.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 41 It’s not about feeling emotions. It’s about understanding thought patterns that drive behavior.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 43 When you can see a set of numbers and have an intuition about how to move them around or how to increase one part to make the whole better, or when you can see the natural relationships and patterns between the numbers, you have systemic intuition. You’re looking at a bounded set of data and connecting whatever missing pieces might be there, and then intuiting what needs to change.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 47 Her intellectual intuition allows her to seek out motivations and read behavior and tailor the story to the people as she discovers them. One of the very first things she said to me when we started coaching was, “I don’t know how I write each book.” (And she’s finished dozens of novels at this point.) Part of her journey as a professional writer has been to trust the intellectual intuition (the way she can read behavior and understand motivations), even when there’s a part of her intellectual brain that really wants to know the story ahead of time.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 65 your intuition might be wrong at times, but it won’t get more capable if you don’t exercise it. It won’t become smarter if you don’t trust it. If the fear of being wrong or the fear of failure is keeping you from trusting intuition, then I highly recommend working on that as your development project following reading this book. Increasing your ability to be wrong, or your ability to see failure as the path to success will pay off exponentially. This might be the most important skill an intuitive can possess.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 71 you will not become a better intuitive writer by outlining if you are a discovery writer.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 92 seeing the creative process as a collaboration in that way can ease some pressure. If we feel allowed to wait for our Muse or helpful genius, we might feel freer to give ourselves the time we need to let our unconscious processes do their thing.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 93 I consider myself an immersive writer. That’s what I call writers who write not only from inside the snow globe, but from “inside the character suit.” They are feeling their way around their fictional world, while also experiencing that world as the character in a way similar to what’s described as “method acting.”

Highlight (Yellow) Page 97 The original concept, idea, or even outline, which once gave them clarity simply needs to be re-jiggered, based on what they’ve learned about the characters and the world through living in it for a bit.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 98 What if the special kind of creativity employed by some intuitive people requires belief? In a similar way, possibly, to how positive attitude affects some medical outcomes? What if your belief in that magic, your faith and trust in your creative ability, is your tether to your Deep Well, that part of your consciousness where the truly special waits to be released?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 99 If you think back to who you were as a writer, before you decided to “become a writer” and learn how it’s done, what was different? What was easier? What was better?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 106 Most intuitive writers can give you a list of things they learned not to do, when they were first writing. (Don’t start with backstory. Don’t write long paragraphs. Those were my first two.) That’s one type of sensor, too. Feedback from others.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 107 It’s possible to be a good (or great) writer with only your own internal story sensors as your guide. Or to employ some vigilance over what you do and don’t pay attention to. (Like selecting which of your editor’s developmental feedback to listen to.) So I don’t want to insist that you have to intentionally use all these data sets to hone your intuition.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 107 Do you need to be aware of the sensors? No. Do you need to be conscious of the data? No. You just need to be aware that the sensors are there, picking up the data about whether or not the scene / story / premise / character is compelling.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 109 Whenever I talk to intuitive writers about autopilot, someone inevitably says, “wow, I wish I could just know exactly where I’m going.” What they mean is, “I wish I could get a list of directions for where to drive on the map.” I would say, your autopilot does actually know where it’s going. It just doesn’t always tell you.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 110 There’s something about knowing the nuances of the character that will provide the “lock-in” for these writers. Typically, as they’re writing, they have to keep referring to the characters and who they are in order to solve plot problems. In fact, more often than not, any stuckness in a book can be solved by returning to the coordinates. Character coordinates might look like: Emotions in the scene Emotional arc throughout the book Conflicting motivations Character backstory Trajectory of character development What a character needs to learn Every character-driven writer connects with a slightly different manifestation of character coordinates.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 111 If you happen to use character coordinates to steer your autopilot, and you also outline, you need to give yourself permission to change the outline to suit who the characters become as you write the draft.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 114 Those of you who are stakes-first writers need to know what matters to a person before you can write them. What do they have to lose? What is on the line?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 115 When you need to know the stakes before you can write, you are often looking for the central conflict or the central dilemma that the story revolves around. Once you know the stakes (what’s at stake for each character), the conflict builds itself. One wins for awhile, the other wins for awhile, and then there’s a big showdown.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 119 We can’t turn off our autopilot intuition completely, but we can “switch to manual” for a length of time. Often, this happens unintentionally.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 120 I’ve Done Something Wrong But I Don’t Know What: When this type of don’t-know-what’s-wrong intuition happens, there will always be a fix that presents itself once you start digging in. It will often be a painful process

Highlight (Yellow) Page 121 What I’ve found to be true for almost all writers who get to this place is that there’s a particular type of intuition coordinate (character, ending, turning point, stakes, etc.) that’s causing the glitch. Typically, knowing which one drives your orientation will help. The real key for this type: It’s okay not to know.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 125 Questions to ask: “Has ‘just writing through it’ worked for me in the past?” and “What’s my first instinct?”

Highlight (Yellow) Page 125 I Need to Know What Happened This is an offshoot of something-is-wrong-but-I-don’t-know-where vigilance. Typically, when you feel the “something’s wrong” feeling, your immediate response will be to look all the way forward or all the way backward. (What happened to them before the book started, or how is this going to end?)

Highlight (Yellow) Page 125 Knowing motivation from the start won’t stop this from happening, because the motivation you think they have and the motivation they show you will often be different.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 127 Questions to ask: “Have I gone back and read a couple of chapters?” and “Do I need to go back to the beginning of the book?”

Highlight (Yellow) Page 128 One Of These Details Is Wrong: You might need to read a book (research or another fiction book). Maybe watch a documentary. Or open the (gasp!) internet to research.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 129 Questions to ask: “Is there something I need to research?” and “Is there a nagging question I need to answer about the character?”

Highlight (Yellow) Page 129 some writers will switch back and forth between different types of vigilance even within the same book. The key isn’t that you have to be one type. They key is diagnosing what’s going on so you can get through the stoppage quicker.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 132 The other 5/8 of writers bounce back and forth between needing to know something and needing to know nothing. This segment is the hardest place to be when you’re first starting off because you’re never sure just how much to plot and how much not to. Often, those of us in the “middle” of the extremes have to do a lot of experimentation about how much information we need and don’t need. Therefore, our process can change almost from book to book while we discover how much we need to know.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 136 Some may actually loathe the idea of going back and editing. Typically, we see a few major reasons why that loathing happens. You’re not in the stream anymore, so the immersion in the story isn’t the same the second time through. You’re afraid you’ve made major mistakes that will require major rewrites. You’re afraid you didn’t follow the rules and you don’t want to face the extreme process of forcing your book to follow the rules. When the dislike of editing comes from a place of fear-of-mistakes, we try to coach a growth mindset.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 137 This is where we need to differentiate between intuition and skill. \[...\] When it’s intuition, it will be backed up by personality alignment. It will be backed up by a desire to find more certainty about what happens next. It will be supported by a desire to make sure you do justice to the story or the characters. We’ll see a need to process more deeply or to think over something. Intuition is always backed up by something you don’t know.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 139 Not wanting to edit is often an intuitive goal misalignment with the goals of editing. When it’s intuition, it will be backed up by not caring how someone else thinks the books hit. It will be supported by a lack of desire to do it ‘right” according to an external standard or by a knowledge that I’ve done what needs to be done in the story and it doesn’t need to be changed. We’ll see a comfort with the books selling however they’re going to sell. “I’ve done it the way I want to do it.” That’s what it sounds like when intuition is at play.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 140 Some intuitive writers genuinely can’t get back into the stream of the book once they’ve told the story the first time. They’re not interested in thinking about whether or not they made the right choices, and they can’t get re-immersed in the story in the same way. They’re also generally okay with however the books do without major edits. (This isn’t to say they don’t proofread or maybe even do line edits, but they’re not interested in revisions, major edits, or outside opinions about whether or not their stories are correct.)

Highlight (Yellow) Page 142 Their intuition knows what needs to change, but that resistance is there because rhetorical questions cause thought spirals and then we decide there’s a lion at the mouth of the cave.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 142 editing is one of the best ways to hone your intuition.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 142 When you can see where your intuition was leading you in one direction, you can start to help your autopilot ask better questions on the way through the draft the first time.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 143 Trying to force intuition into a rule box is not teaching intuition how to be more intuitive.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 143 There are still guiding principles to how your intuition can create story, but it won’t look like, “at 25%, you’d better have this and at 50%, you’d better have this.” It will look like, “is something compelling happening here?” Or, “Is this scene moving the story forward?” Or, “Is there still tension here?” Or, “Do I still want to keep reading? If not, why not?” Understanding the answers to the big-picture questions is more likely to help you hone your intuition than learning how to apply rules backwards to an intuitively written story.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 145 Following rules can trip up intuition. Following coordinates (I should have stakes shifting… how long has it been since the stakes shifted?) is intuition.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 145 If we’re intuitive, or if we’re abstract, or if we’re big-picture, we want to edit for intuitive concepts, abstract concepts, or big-picture concepts. We want to edit for coordinates. Are my characters making compelling choices that create conflict (internal or external)? Are the stakes high enough? Do they have enough to lose (internally or externally—not all stories are the same balance of those two)? Are my threads getting tied up and opened? Are there open threads somewhere that I could be touching? Am I pushing the action forward? Am I complicating things or raising stakes or changing trajectory?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 146 Every type of intuition coordinate has a different set of questions they’ll want to ask of themselves. Each of those examples of questions are things I will routinely pull out to ask writers if they’re headed back into revisions. Rather than focusing on rules or structure, I try to focus with intuitive writers on the coordinates that guide them through the story. If they are character driven, we focus on characters and their feelings and motivations. If they are plot driven, we focus on turning points and raising stakes. If they are sense-of-place writers, we focus on the environment and the events.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 147 if editing causes fear because you’re afraid you don’t follow the rules, stop using that editing process. Find your coordinates instead, and find your vigilance areas, and work to your own set of rules. Not an arbitrary set of rules.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 148 becoming better at intuition is about building the three parts of your autopilot. Continuing to push good data at your sensors. Honing how you feed your coordinates. Strategically engaging your vigilance.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 149 How To Develop Your Sensors This is the place where we generally want the least amount of awareness of data. Most of the time, pressing too hard on “what data am I taking in” will overwhelm. The more intuitive we are, our best sensor-interpretation ability is subconscious. Not conscious.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 149 Keep watching movies or shows. Keep reading good books. Keep consuming story. Keep looking at your own story. Keep researching. Keep thinking about your characters or discovering more about them. Keep feeding yourself the data or processing the data how you normally process it. Even. If. You. Also. Enjoy. These. Activities. They. Are. Still. Work.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 150 we can also start reminding our wise self that we do need to feed our sensors. That means consuming good story. In any medium that works for you. Build the sensors.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 151 How To Develop Your Coordinates: pick out all the types of coordinates you’ve used in the past. Copy those descriptions or the questions onto a piece of paper (or use the Stuck List workbook we discussed earlier2). Keep that accessible as you write and plan. Coordinates are the place in your autopilot where you can have a bit more awareness, because they’re often the reason you get stuck. Knowing what questions to ask when you’re stuck is the big key to developing your intuition.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 151 Becoming better at honing your coordinates might mean: Phoning a friend more quickly. Walking away from the computer faster. Writing about writing without the “I give up” moment. Going to research the thing I keep trying to avoid researching. Leaving the house faster. Tracking back to read what you’ve already written without it being the last resort.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 152 How To Interpret Your Vigilance: go into the descriptions from the Vigilance Types chapter and make notes about which ones really resonated for you. When you see yourself following a common pattern, it’s so much more likely that the fix we outline for that pattern will work for you.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 160 not everyone can write to market, period. Some of us have internal sensors that are not related to any reader feedback or editorial feedback. We’re just writing to please ourselves. So when our interest or what we believe is a compelling story overlaps with what the market wants to read, we sell. And when those interests don’t overlap, we don’t sell as well

Highlight (Yellow) Page 162 When you’re primarily interested in what makes you happy, it’s not worth trying to turn that off so you can write to market. It’s a much better alignment to find the market where the books you like are selling. Not everyone will want to (or do well when they) write to market.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 168 watch your intake. If you’re searching out information all the time about how you are wrong in what you’re doing, you’re going to find it. I guarantee. Sometimes, it’s more important to shut down intake for your sanity than it is for you to find what might or might not be wrong right now. The third thing I’d suggest is: try just trusting.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 168 Experiment with your intuition and see what produces the best results. It’s genuinely difficult to build trust in intuition if you’re not willing to let it be right and be wrong.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 170 When your vigilance is unstudied (you don’t know the places to pull back and the places not to), you’re almost always early in your career. Typically, the people in the previous subheading (your vigilance is confused) are farther into their career. That’s the primary differentiator.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 170 Yes, learning can be helpful. But if you’re intuitive, nothing will be as helpful as iteration.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 175 Having a platform as an intuitive can be overwhelming because everyone is telling us what we should do and where we should be and even when it conflicts with our intuition about what we want and don’t want, we might follow the advice because we can’t be certain they’re not correct.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 177 If you would identify has an HSP, limiting your access to social media becomes even more important (and email, potentially), because the more people’s emotions you’re exposed to, the less in control of your own thought trains you are.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 178 When intuitive people talk about getting a gut feeling they shouldn’t do something, that hesitation is always worth exploring.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 179 Because this internal limiter (the hesitation) can often have buried reasons like that, it can be difficult to trust them. But there’s always a reason. (Not everyone needs to know the reason, of course, but when you’re questioning the premise, you really do need to know the reason. Because if that had really been true, if they really hadn’t liked going to new places, then that trip would have been a bad idea. Plus, sometimes the internal limiter is putting together other pieces of data, thinks it’s not conscious of, and it really can’t tell the reason.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 181 The less I want to do something (for any particular reason), the less likely I am to be wildly successful at it.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 190 So this part (when to take the wheel, and when not to follow a system) becomes the most complicated question of all to answer. When am I failing because I haven’t learned enough yet? When am I failing because something needs to change? When am I failing because I need to not advertise these books?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 192 Make sure the person is a patient-with-questions person. You absolutely need to be able to ask questions of an expert when you’re an intuitive. You’ll catch some things very quickly, and some things not as quickly. Patience is key and willingness to answer questions.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 197 What is your job, writing books? What purpose are we aligning you to?

Highlight (Yellow) Page 198 To Fulfill a Childhood Dream: So many of us were readers as children and decided we wanted to be writers because of the stories we consumed. \[...\] Alignment with this dream often looks like stubbornness or resilience. The “but I’ve always known I would do this” feeling that makes you continue to learn or experiment or publish, even when the results aren’t showing what would fulfill the dream.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 199 To Tell The Stories: So many authors know what it’s like to have characters in our heads, talking to us. Either we’re telling their stories compulsively, because we can’t not, or we want to tell the stories intentionally, because the process of telling stories is so much fun.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 202 To Write Great Books \[...\] we’d discussed how important it was that the books were as good as they could be. Not just good enough, but as good as they could be. That’s a very different standard from minimum viable product (and minimum viable product works very well for a lot of people… just not for everyone). For some writers, writing great books requires a whole different type of alignment, business-wise, from other purposes. It might require more time or more edit rounds. It might require more thought or more ideas. (And yes, it’s possible to write great books without them taking forever… this is not quality over quantity. It’s about alignment.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 204 Given the goal of “great books,” they were as productive as they could possibly be. It wasn’t a waste of time to focus on quality, for them, because that was the promise they made to their readers.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 206 Generally speaking, when you’ve learned a system and it isn’t working, it’s the wrong system for you. You’re not doing it wrong. (I mean, in theory, you might be failing to execute parts of the plan, but it’s not likely that more work will help execute better.) When your intuition is screaming at you that it’s the wrong fit, scream back at the part that says, “but we have to do it this way.”

Highlight (Yellow) Page 222 If a person isn’t willing to step inside the snow globe with you and believe you are right about what you see, they are not worth listening to. For intuitives, or really, for anyone. But especially for intuitives.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 232 bringing someone inside your snow globe is the best way to listen to business advice. Having someone you trust (whoever that person is) to help you interpret the data coming at you will be one of the most important investments of your time you can make. It’s also why we encourage people to seek out author friends who are similar to you and who have similar goals and who you click with. Having people to help you understand what’s going on inside your mind and inside your slow globe is priceless. Find your village.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 243 In order to truly move past the situation, we have to accept the fact that we didn’t know something, or that our intuition missed something. We do want to be curious about how the “missing it” happened. Typically, when we work through this in coaching, we’re looking for the data that our sensors were picking up. What was making me believe this was a good idea? Was I not casting a wide enough research net? Was I afraid of failure? Was I listening to a particular person who doesn’t have my best interests at heart? Was I trusting certainty = correct? What was the cause of the intuitive failure? The more compassion I can have for my past selves and how they handled things at their best, the more quickly I can move past the failure and into the learning curve.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 246 It may seem strange to think that there’s a part of you that needs forgiveness from another part of you, but that’s exactly what has to happen when intuition is wrong. We have to see that little part of ourselves that was doing its best and bring it back into the fold. Keeping it outside in the rain isn’t going to do anything. It needs to be forgiven and integrated. Moving forward, the intuition has to feel like you trust it again. As a collective, you need to know which data to trust and which data to seek out, yes. You do want to learn from the experience. But, absolutely, re-integrate the intuition after the acceptance, so you can move forward with intuition on your team again.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 247 Strategize Now that you’re all on the same team again, it’s important to strategize about how not to end up in that place again. If there are groups or people you need to stop listening to, make that happen. If there are markers to be on the lookout for, keep vigilant. But most of the time, what happened in the past won’t replicate itself, so the biggest strategy we can implement is moving forward with trust in the intuition. No more punishing. No more past-excavating. Forgiveness, and forward motion.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 248 Find Intuitive-Friendly Environments A huge part of teaching your intuition how to be smarter is about who you surround yourself with (because your sensors are always taking in the data of the people around you). When people understand intuition and are supportive of it, you’re in an intuitive-friendly environment.

It is essential, when you hone your intuition, that you surround yourself with people who believe you. People who will step inside your snow globe and listen to what you have to say and believe your intuition.

It sounds more like, “I wonder why your intuition went there,” in a curious, friendly, let-the-deer-come-to-you voice.

In order to hone your intuition, you need to become more aware of what you need in order to be at your best. When you are in a time of life that is exceptionally difficult, and your body and mind lock up if you don’t feel safe, then you need safety. When you are in a learning curve, you might need baby steps, or a step backward. And when you need challenges, you need challenges.

Highlight (Yellow) Page 264 Living the intuitive life, from here on out, is all about living as though your intuition is your superpower. It means creating environments that are intuition-friendly. It means making space for intuition to happen unhindered. It means shutting down sources of input that are damaging your intuitive ability to function. It means nurturing your ability. It means taking action when you feel an intuitive push. For some of us, that will mean making space for more silence. For others, it will mean making space for more action.
