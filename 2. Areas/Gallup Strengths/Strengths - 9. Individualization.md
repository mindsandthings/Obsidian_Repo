Showing up in my frustration with healthcare: my body is specific, and malfunctions in specific ways, and is not identical to bodies that are not malfunctioning.

Individualization:

Chris Voss former FBI negotiation guy

use it to make people interesting to you. lean into how you embrace that character drivenness; some writers have their characters write the books for them.

writing characters who are real people to the readers

"inner rebel" part of it - doing what you do because you're you and you're going to be you. distinct writing from others.

every person needs to be treated in a customized way, so does every character and every book

individualization is "intellectual empathy"

getting to know characters—learning what happened to them—a lot of discovery

sometimes characters do things and you can't make them do it different, you can only drop the story
which means often editing won't work
maybe pulling back and looking at the characters backstory how it influences them?
