~Michael's abbreviated commitments~ 

"Games" here refers to solo activities only. 

Before I start playing games, I need to think of something I could do after I stop playing games and write that down. 

When I start playing games I must stop after 1-5 minutes and assess as described below. If I continue playing games, I must stop every 25 minutes thereafter and assess.  

Assessing:
* Take a movement break (30s not on device that I'm playing games on) 
* Evaluate physical comfort. Move into a minimally ergonomic position. If this is difficult, make sure I'm sufficiently warm and have the physical supports I need.  
* Ask: Am I avoiding a specific task or feeling?
	* If so: 
		* journal for 3 minutes about it, why I'm avoiding it, and why I am willing to continue avoiding it 
* Ask: Will continuing make me unprepared for something important in the next 24 hours?  
	* If so, spend 30 minutes preparing. After that I can skip this question for the rest of the day.
	* If I think 25 minutes would make me unprepared but a shorter time wouldn't, I can approve myself to continue for a shorter time. 
* Ask: Am I feeling unusually bad? 
	* If so, I may not continue unless I spend 5 minutes doing something that might help me feel better or be more functional, other than games. Up to 2 of those minutes can be spent brainstorming things to do; more if I can't think of anything.  
* Ask: Is there anything on my list of daily tasks, projects, etc, I'd be interested in or find it not unpleasant to spend 5 minutes on? 
	* If so, spend 5 minutes doing that.  
	* alternately, do the thing i listed when I started playing games. 
* Ask: Am I enjoying the game or do I just feel compelled to continue?  
	* If compelled, spend 3 minutes doing an enjoyable non-game thing. Then I may continue.  

If anything in the assessment requires me to stop, I can start this whole process again after 25 minutes. What this means in practice is that I can always spend 5 minutes out of every 30 minutes playing games, even if I never don't pass the assessment.

updates and rulings 

When the timer goes off, if I'm in the middle of a process that can't be saved, I can spend up to 1 minute completing it. I can't use that minute for anything else, and it must be timed.
