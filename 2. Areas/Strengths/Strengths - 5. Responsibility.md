Can't believe it's time for this already. I think I'm doing pretty well on responsibility actually. 

## Thu, Oct 6, 2022
Time for a cleanout of my plans and to-do's so I can meaningfully commit to things. 

## Fri, Sep 30, 2022
Feels like being careful with responsibility is cutting myself off from people, but also that cutting myself off from people (by carefully not doing things that could make them feel indebted to me) is something I'm actively trying to do for safety's sake.

Need to be careful; joining new circles and don't want to overwhelm. Feels like committing to doing things for people makes me more likely to do the same in other areas of life too. Also don't want to overwhelm or intimidate people by taking things too seriously and being too responsible.

I am trying to be selective and careful and not overcommit, and will need to do that moving forward with OSS volunteering if I do that.

In writing, I'm trying not to overschedule myself.


# Aug 2022 areas of focus

You have to know what you committed to and make sure they know too. Make sure you understand when they're speculating/considering and their plans are still open to change, and when they're ready to implement.

Always ask "What am I committing to here? What are the parameters? What's the job description?" I'm in control of how this commitment happens. Don't assume that everybody has responsibility or will do something just because they say they will.

Align yourself with those who share your sense of commitment.

Responsibility: you have to know what you committed to and make sure they know too. Make sure you understand when they're speculating/considering and their plans are still open to change, and when they're ready to implement.

"Responsibility rage" - needs to be private, shared with other responsibility people.

Futuristic person making lots of speculation and responsibility person taking them as plans.

Be aware it will tell you something is a necessity when it's not.

Responsibility dislikes sacrificing quality for speed.

You cannot ignore this strength.

But you can back out if you made a commitment based on a different set of parameters.

If you work on your responsibility over time you can teach it what the commitment really means - what it means to take responsibility, what a reasonable commitment really means.

Always ask "What am I committing to here? What are the parameters? What's the job description?" I'm in control of how this commitment happens.

(Also: be clear with other people on what they're committing to.)

For example moving release dates: readers are not organizing their life around that, so it's ok to move or not even give one. NY publishers give release dates because the book has been done for 7-8 months by that point and they want to organize events around the date.

Commitment is malleable if you are aware of the parameters

Some of the most developed responsibility strengths will say no because other strengths (like strategic) prevent it

Always ask "What am I committing to here? What are the parameters? What's the job description?" I'm in control of how this commitment happens. Don't assume that everybody has responsibility or will do something just because they say they will.


## Gallup video notes

Mature responsibility says "I have to develop others"
"Hey, do we all remember that ____ is what we said we would do? Is that still important?"
"How do we sort to our commitments that are going to have the biggest impact?"

Most common to show up with responsibility:
-- achiever
-- least likely is command, but command is the least common theme in the entire database. command is needs of the moment, responsibility is needs of the backlist

make sure you're following the essence of who you are; practice the value of your yes
