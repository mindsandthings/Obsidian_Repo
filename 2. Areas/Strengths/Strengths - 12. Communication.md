Communication notes:

gallup emphasizes it doesn't have to be verbal it can be written (although she thinks they're all verbal)

people who are about the way things get said because there's a message they want to communicate somehow

there's always a medium - visual feedback - to see if their message has been seen

very important to communication people to be able to see if they've been understood or not

a lot of communications are external processors

the important piece for communication is the reshaping and redelivery of message - why communications often repeat themselves

they draft slower, go over their lines more, go over a few paragraphs and want to go back

when their drafts are finished they're very clean

you need to find someone to talk out loud too

the less you want to talk the more you need to talk

communication can make you a not great drafter but an excellent reviser

communications people often want to revise as they write, and struggle with wanting to move forward but needing to make sure it lands
