This one, more than others, seems built on the idea that everyone already has plenty of relationships to make deep, and that there won't be any issues with going from being acquaintances to the kind of friend you can deepen a relationship with. 

Also of note: [The Curious Absence of Masculine Pride and Competition](obsidian://open?vault=obsidian&file=4.%20Archive%2Fvalidating%2FThe%20Curious%20Absence%20of%20Masculine%20Pride%20and%20Competition) 
It's this—the automatic assumption that male characters will spill their emotional guts for the benefit of the reader in situations in which it would be neither safe nor healthy for them to do so—that reads as exploitative and fetishistic. They haven't engaged in the needed trust development to do that, and it reads as writers really failing to understand why someone would not do this, and failing to understand why someone would be uncomfortable with watching a writer unreflexively watch a character endangering themselves. There is an actual problem here, and it is not that I'm being a prude; it's that it's not possible to distinguish people who really really want this level of vulnerability/control in real life, and people who are just writing it unreflexively, and watching people possibly-unknowingly fetishize it and then expect you to participate under the thread of being seen as a judgmental traitor is...not progressive, actually.

Note: working on this strength is deeply triggering because it assumes that having this as a strength means it is successful.

Man, this is just not helpful - this is for people who are desirable.

Writing about relationship development, showing characters passing trust barriers.

We need to get to know our characters, like making friends.

Leaning into that relationship development can make us better writers.

Relators are good at knowing how to build and foster trust. 

Stick with characters or write friend groups
