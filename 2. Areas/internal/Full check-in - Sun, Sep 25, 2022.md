# Update
## Job
We're taking an indexing course and planning to become a freelance indexer. Hopefully this will give us money and a portable career. 

We're not doing ASL because we didn't want the covid risk and had serious worries about being handicapped at networking. 

At indexing, we've been working very hard at getting along with people, and are also trying to keep an eye on our tendency to fawn/be too forward. We're aware that we want badly to show off, and are trying not to signal too hard. We're also working on networking with and being kind and welcoming to other students. 

## Health
We got another pair of glasses in June and they helped, but became less helpful over time. We're currently doing vision exercises we found ourselves in hopes they'll help specifically with difficulty seeing in the far distance. 

We may try a therapy that involves setting your sinuses / sphenoid into alignment, but are skeptical of its safety and concerned that if it's effective with our VH then our glasses will make things worse. 

## Social/writing
We're checking PubQ, but not participating, due to concerns that we may have alienated people due to personality. We're also concerned it may just not be healthy for us, given its tendency toward purity/mobbing/judgmentalness. In general, we want to lay low in areas where we persistently irritate people, and try again with new areas rather than trying to rehabilitate the old ones. 

We're still working on the novel and are cleaning up the outline for the latter half before writing it again. We're careful with Sara - not super-close, not too forward - but we do still talk and share with her. 

## Growing up
We've been doing a lot of mourning for the input we were never provided growing up, and recognizing how uninvolved both our parents were and are. 

## Home
Ana is gone. She still comes by sometimes because she's associated with Celeste, but she's no longer employed by Eric and Allie, thank god. 

Celeste is in an assisted living facility. She's rarely here. When she is, we don't look at or talk to her except to the extent necessary. 

Maya has been less into us for a while, and we feel pretty sad about it. We're not really done processing our emotions about that. 

## CABS/Timezone
CABS is silent now, but some of us (Millie, tele, Sky, Dark Blue, Lilisystem, Harmony, Roxy and Minty, NFS and the other one) moved to my new server, Timezone. Signa had already left cabs and wasn't interested in joining, at least at the time. Helio blew up at us‚Äîwe're still not sure why, other than that they felt we didn't listen to them. We passively declined to take one of the trans women up on an opportunity to be yelled at, and they dropped out of the conversation. 

Millie invited us to their immersive daydreaming server, and we joined on our other account. We are thinking about that as a possible way to be more in touch with ourselves. 

Our weekly voice chats are a highlight of our week. We've noticed that Dark Blue brings their RSD into things, and that Sky is going through some stuff and we're not always sure what's up. We've thought about bringing up inviting either signa or BC, but we're wary of bringing it up. 

## Michael
Goes as usual. We're more supportive, but still distant. We've tried making out some but often I just can't do it. We have not had sex. We have not told him we're plural due to internal objections. 

We don't know where that's going, or if it's going anywhere. 

## Eric, Allie, Maya
We are pretty happy living in this house. It's a very nice house and a good space. We've been wiped out by the summer heat, but it's heading into fall now, and should be better. 

## Family
We've been drawing with Julie in VR, and writing a cozy mystery for her while she travels again. 

Dad has continued to be distant and to repeat himself. We worry about that. 

Julie and I met with Mom and talked about eldercare; the gist is that Michael and I will help pay but neither of us will let mom live with us. 

I've hung out with Katie a couple times and we seem to get along. 

## Strengths
The big writing thing this summer has been Becca Syme's Clifton Strengths stuff. It's helped us reorient on what we value about our own writing, and let go a little of some of the bad shit that happened that ground us down. 

In general, we've been working a lot on boundaries, and on recognizing when we're doing things we're not okay with. 

## Exercise
We're walking 5-10k steps/day and doing callanetics for hips/behind and stomach 2-3x/week. After our orthodontia is done and we're not triggering TMJ issues so often, we're going to try doing Muldowney again. 

Oh, the other big health thing new within the last few days is the Perrin technique, for getting lymph nodes to drain correctly. This seems to be a very helpful deal for us. 

## Upcoming
The stuff we've had backburnered is: plurality stuff, and socializing stuff. We know we can't go back to social stuff like we did before, because environments have changed to become more threatening and we're better at noticing the threats. We want to make tentative steps exploring social stuff, and to be very uncommitted to most spaces. 

With plurality stuff: we're often able to check in with ourselves for a bit, and then wind up just...not doing it anymore. at all. Especially if we move quickly, I think. 

We think it's mostly a need to not let *other people* have access to vulnerable aspects of ourselves, and a fear that we will voluntarily hand those out in order to not have to armor ourselves, if we have access to them at all. So they just kind of wind up in front or they don't. They take over or they're hidden. And we don't take all of ourselves into account. 

Similarly, EBT has been helpful but it doesn't seem to go anywhere for the same reason: we do stuff for a while and then just stop. 

## Personality changes
We've become very wary, but also much better at masking our wariness. We did major reprogramming on our tendency to approach/fawn/show off and irritate people, which we hope will help people tolerate us longer. We're also much more willing to bail on spaces that exhibit social justice tendencies, which, unfortunately, seems to include all of SFF (which has also seemingly leaned hard into diversity = race and only race, in the last two years, a bizarre approach for a discipline that has always fundamentally been about awareness of the Other). 

We're in general more likely to show very little of ourself but to act like we're showing a lot of ourself, which we hope will help us navigate social waters better. 

We're aware this sounds devastating, and in some ways it is. However, we also understand it's what other people seem to respond better to, and we have chosen to prioritize that over the therapist-driven "let your light shine" approach that fails to take into account others. 

We're trying to attend to what we do that annoys others, so that we don't annoy them thoughtlessly or heedlessly. We generally feel these are things we should have been helped to learn growing up, rather than trained to do the exact opposite of. 

## Overall
We're making another try of it, basically. Of getting back into the world, but in a different way from before, one we think may lead to different results. Less flashy, more tiring and stressful, but also less traumatic and less dangerous.
