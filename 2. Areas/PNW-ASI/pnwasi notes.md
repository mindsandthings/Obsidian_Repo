If you think we should switch to Google, you could take it over then since you would know more about that setup. I'd be willing to be back up. I don't see that we need to worry alot about backup when someone goes out of town. There isn't that much activity on the listserv.

If it would be easier to talk about this, my phone number is 413-218-9046.


# Partially written list of mailing list notes - finish this up 

Don't respond to any request to join till we figure out how to proceed


-- List members must be ASI members; double-check before approving their request. If they don't show up on the ASI list, email them and ask them to forward the membership confirmation email if so. If not members, give them the option of joining a separate contact list for non-members. 

-- List admins vs mods: we can split these duties by designating a separate moderator password; however, the admins will continue to get the notification emails so there may not be a reason to do that. 

-- Removing people from the list: Maria compares every few months. Don't remove monthly; give people a couple months post-lapse for time to renew. 

==We may be overdue for removing ex-members.
