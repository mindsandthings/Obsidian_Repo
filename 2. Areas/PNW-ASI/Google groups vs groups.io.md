My overall assessment is that the best listserv depends on whether the membership list Maria provides includes members' email addresses. If it doesn't, Groups.io may be a better option, because Groups.io's ability to set members' display names when adding them is more reliable than Google Groups'. If the membership list does include members' email addresses, then Google Groups is a better option because it allows us to direct-add members to the listserv, and Groups.io only lets us direct-add folks if we pay $20/mo. 

List of relevant differences between Google Groups and Groups.io:
1) Google Groups allows us to direct-add members, as well as allowing us to send an email invitation or allowing people to request to be added. Groups.io supports invitations and requests to add, but makes direct-adding members a paid feature. 
2) Both Google Groups and Groups.io let you set someone's display name at the time you add them, but some people have reported that it doesn't work consistently for Google Groups for them (see https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/91769/how-to-set-the-display-name-for-group-members-in-google-groups). It worked for me both times I tried it, though. Also, if we can get chapter members' email addresses along with their names, I can set up an Excel file to match exported list data with copied-in member data on both names and email addresses, which would make accurate names less needed. 
3) Groups.io lets each owner and moderator choose whether to receive notifications when someone requests to join the group; in Google Groups, you can't turn the notifications off. However, I believe in both cases there is one notification only, not repeat notifications like with the current listserv, so it may not be as big a deal (and people who don't want these notifications can set up a filter in their email so they don't see them). 
4) Groups.io is nicer to use, but not hugely so. 






# Member list sorting and export

Once someone is added, only they can change their display name. You can change it (at least in Google Groups) by removing and re-adding them to the group, but they will get a notification that they've been added to a group they're already in and may be confused.

The owner/moderator has 14 days to approve a join request for Groups.io. Google Groups join requests do not expire (although invitations do, after 7 days). 

Winner: Groups.io, because an owner/moderator who doesn't want to receive notifications can just turn them off.
