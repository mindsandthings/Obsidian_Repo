I familiarized myself with the website and it does seem very clean and well-structured. I did notice a couple minor things (which I could change as my first tasks, if you want):

    Links to the chapter charter and bylaws are correct on the Chapter Governance page but not on the Chapter Charter page
    On the Newsletter Archive page, in the middle of the page there's some text saying "Links below not updated; recommend deletion and just end with note to contact archivist". Most of the links below that work, except for the Spring 2009 and Summer 2008 pdfs which are damaged and won't open.
