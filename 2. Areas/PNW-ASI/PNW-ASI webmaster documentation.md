# 1. Areas of Responsibility

The PNW/ASI chapter website, a WordPress site located at [https://pnwasi.org](https://pnwasi.org), is maintained by three entities.

**1.1**  **Domain/Registrar**

The domain (pnwasi.org) is held by ASI, American Society for Indexing. Contact [info@asindexing.org](mailto:info@asindexing.org) or Gwen at [gwen@asindexing.org](mailto:gwen@asindexing.org).

**Host: UUism Networks**

Hosting is with UUism Networks  ([www.UUism.net](http://www.uuism.net/)), which is owned/managed by Jim Hermann ([hostmaster@uuism.net](mailto:hostmaster@uuism.net);  815-519-4184). The cost is $90/2 years for web hosting.  Payment to Jim at UUism Networks is on a two-year cycle, due in late December (usually) of odd years. He sends the invoice to a webmaster, who forwards it to the PNW Treasurer, who submits it to Gwen/ASI for payment from PNW’s account.

**1.2**  **Webmasters**

The volunteer webmasters are responsible for updating the website.

Here are the current co-webmasters:

## 1.2.1      Accessing website  
Webmasters use the WordPress dashboard to edit the website’s pages. There is a Login link in the footer of the website’s pages. The login URL is [https://pnwasi.org/wp-admin](https://pnwasi.org/wp-admin). Sam, or whoever is the owner of the PNW pnadmin account, sets up the user (or users). From the WordPress Dashboard > Users > Add new, then add the email and password for the co-webmaster.  The email for the pnadmin account is meetingpnw@gmail.com.  
  

_1.2.2_     _Co-webmaster shifts  
_The current co-webmasters can decide how they want to split the duties.

_1.2.3_     _Updating website  
_It’s best for the webmasters to log on with their own accounts (not pnadmin) when making updates, so it will be clear who did which update. The webmasters update the Directory of PNW Indexers page as needed. See section 2 of this document for specific directions. Make other changes when requested and necessary, according to sections 3 to 4. Keep a log of the changes as described in section 5.

_1.2.4_     _Working with the WordPress dashboard  
_Webmasters will preferably have some previous experience with WordPress. This site uses the Block Editor, but it’s possible to revert to the Classic Editor. Find help at [https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-editor/](https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-editor/)

_1.2.5_     _Content creation_  
Content creation is the responsibility of the PNW Chair, Program Chair, and Membership Coordinator. Webmasters are responsible for uploading the content for the updates in a timely and accurate manner.  
  

_1.2.6_      _Email notifications  
_UUism, the web-hosting service, includes an email address at webmaster@pnwasi.org, which is used on the PNW website. Emails to this address redirect to the email address of one of the webmasters. To change the forwarding email addresses, email Jim (UUism) at [hostmaster@uuism.net](mailto:hostmaster@uuism.net).  
  

# 2. Updating Member Directory

**2.1 Adding new members**

_2.1.1 Receiving requests to be added to the Directory of PNW Indexers_  
The Membership Coordinator receives the new member list monthly from ASI near the beginning of the month and welcomes new members with an email that includes an invitation to be included in the directory. The new member emails the webmaster, who then adds the member to the directory. The Membership Coordinator also forwards the list to the webmasters.

_2.1.2 Updating website_  
Add new members by editing the Directory page ([https://pnwasi.org/directory-of-pnw-indexers/](https://pnwasi.org/directory-of-pnw-indexers/))using the format specified on the Directory Application page: [https://pnwasi.org/directory-of-pnw-indexers/directory-application/](https://pnwasi.org/directory-of-pnw-indexers/directory-application/)

_2.1.3 Notifying new members_  
With a short email, notify new members that the Directory page has been updated with their information. Ask them to check the entry for accuracy and to notify you of any needed changes.

**2.2 Deleting non-renewing members**

_2.2.1 Receiving requests from Membership Coordinator and updating website_  
The Membership Coordinator will alert the webmaster about non-renewing members so that they can be removed from the Member Directory and from their Indexer Available entries, if applicable.

_2.2.2 Recording deletions_  
The webmaster will keep a record of the deleted entry in a log to make it easier to add them back if they rejoin.

_2.2.3 Notification of non-renewing member_  
Deleted members do not need to be notified by the webmaster.

# 3. Updating Chapter News and the sidebar

_3.1 Updating the Chapter News posts_  
Update the Chapter News from the Dashboard under “Posts.” These posts are accessed by users via the “Chapter News” page.

_3.2 Updating the sidebar widget_ _with announcements_Add new announcements using the sidebar, found in the Dashboard under Appearance  Widgets. The sidebar announcement can link to a blog post by linking to the Chapter News page, or it can have a link to another relevant page on the website (such as Next Meeting).

# 4. Adding new resources and links

_4.1 Links to online resources_Online resources need to be linked to open in a new window, an option in the edit window when adding a link.

 _4.2 Links to PDF files in WordPress media library_In connecting to a PDF (media file) already existing in (or recently uploaded to) the WordPress media library, use the File URL (in the righthand information), NOT the permalink (at the top of the page). Otherwise, you get a messy intermediary page that requires another click to link to the article. 

# 5. Logging changes

_5.1 Purpose of Logs_

            The purpose of the logs is to keep a record of changes.

_5.2 Procedure of Logs_

            The logs can either be Word docs or emails between the webmasters. Include changes made to the website, problems related to the website, and pending changes that the other webmaster needs to complete.

# 6.  Backing up with UpdraftPlus

_6.1 Weekly automatic updates_

            From the Dashboard  Plugins, find UpdraftPlus. It is set to do automatic weekly backups to the Google Drive of the account [meetingpnw@gmail.com](mailto:meetingpnw@gmail.com). Ask Sam for the password.

# 7.  Dealing with complex issues webmaster on duty cannot immediately resolve

_7.1 Technical issues_

Online WordPress support can sometimes help. Webmasters can consult with each other. If it involves hosting issues (such as the webmaster email or getting accidentally locked out of the site), contact Jim at UUism. If the issue is intractable, contact Joanne Sprott of Cosmic Whispers Design at [joanne@cwsitedesign.com](mailto:joanne@cwsitedesign.com) to see about hiring her on a limited contract.
