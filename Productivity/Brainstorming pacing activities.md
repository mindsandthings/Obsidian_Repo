I want to be able to relax more. I'm not sure how.Â 

Maybe I should idk. take more breaks

cognitive, emotional, physical tasks are all different things. tasks that require focus are things. Tasks that involve stress or fear of evaluation or having to think a lot about others' minds are high-effort. I need to be able to acknowledge that to myself so I can state it.

it's not just like "go take a break and read", it's dependent on what I've been doign and why it's been stressful.
