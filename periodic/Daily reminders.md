# Socialization/job
* Wed, Sep 14, 2022: I would like to close out conversations with people, to make sure they feel heard. I would also like to not take up too much space or time wrapping somethign up. I would like to reply to people when they ask me a question, even if it's late.
* remember to socialize more with your fellow students and other non-leaders 
* how to interrupt less? calm down, breathe, wait.
* don't suck up too much, ok?
* participate more on indexers lists
* keep an eye out for local indexers to network with
* I would like to continue out conversations without suddenly dropping out in chat
* don't be a kid or a young student - be an adult coming in from another field
* Don't take over coworking. It's Kris's; don't try to steal it. 
* (can't you focus on specific quotations? me. be uber careful of sounding complainy. you already got slapped, bitch. you do not have the cred to speak from an info sci authority. remember to be small and meek and "helpful". textual focus, specific quotes with page numbers. you already created a threat. be meek and new. remember, she's irritated with you because everybody else was talking and she couldn't get mad at them)

# Michael

* 2022-08-01: Give Michael a distress number / say "I'm flooded" / tell him what I need/whose court the ball is in
