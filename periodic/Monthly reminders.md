Tell michael it's a bad time instead of being short with him.

remember to use M pwds must remove first 2 and last 2 characters

For foreign transactions over $100, use credit union visa platinum card (has no foreign transaction fees)

Offered Allie and Eric a low- or no-interest loan to cover the relevant part of their mortgage for up to a year if one of them loses their job; remember this

Can ask M what's the agenda for any meeting/discussion

Remember the kid who was the small fuzzies doesn't want to be dragged in when we're angry to overfit the narrative

Ask michael to answer the question I asked first

don't criticize Eric, you already did it. don't interfere in their relationship

Andi and Ada both shared some info about themselves but backed off when you did; remember that with them specifically, and in the future when people send you emails be super vague

"as for spotting people, if you're a freeze/fawn, you're likely to repeat patterns, so you can use yourself as a quick way to gauge things. If you find yourself really wanting to please someone really quickly, or get close to them too fast, or you feel pressured around them, that's probably not a good sign. Anyone who makes you react the way you did to people who mistreated you in the past is suspect. Freeze/fawn is a response to danger, which is something that is being constantly scanned for and can be detected quicker than you're able to consciously realize, and your body will automatically protect you by using what worked in the past: freezing/fawning. So pay attention and be suspect of anyone who strongly triggers this reaction in you."
