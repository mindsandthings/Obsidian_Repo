# Leise (2016) - Pan-granularism and specificity
Pan-granularity to accommodate both readers trying to re-find something specific they remember, and readers who are trying to get general topic coverage or just an idea of what the book is about.

Structural indexing starts with the metatopic, then book sections, chaptesr, chapter sections, and chapter subsections, creatinmg headings/subheading at each level that mirror  the text's structure. It uses the ToC and chapter section/subsections to create entries.

heading: metatopic (book title/subtitle) 
	[subheadings: book sections] (optional) 
	
[heading: book sections] (optional) 
	subheadings: chapters 

headings: chapters 
	subheadings: chapter sections 

headings: chapter sections 
	subheadings: chapter sub-sections

## Benefits of structural indexing:
1. Can potentially prevent overindexing by indexing appropriately through structural index entries. [I think this is referring to winding up with redundant but differently-worded main headings]
2. for complex metatopics, multiple parallel structures will exist, either through direct entries or cross-references before detailed indexing begins, ensuring a solid index structure. [I sort of understood from the example, but reread the example]


## Textual indexing
Means reading the entire text and creating entries. Those entries fall into several types. 

Using terminology from the psychology of classification, there are basic-level categories (cars, tables, dogs, lamps), superordinate categories (vehicles, furniture, animals, housewares), and subordinate categories (dining room tables, work tables, butcher block tables - similar characters but differ by the characteristic of use). 

In indexing, there are:

### 1. Contextual entries
heading: person, place, organization, event, concept
	subheadings: particular context

Wilson, Woodrow
	in 1916 presidential campaign

### 2. Basic-subordinate entries: 
heading: basic-level concept
	subheadings: subordinate concepts

elections
	presidential elections (1916)

### 3. superordinate-basic entries:
heading: superordinate concept
	subheadings: basic level concept

direct relationship:
politics
	elections

and

indirect relationship:
politics
	*See also* elections


These may occur at various levels of abstraction. 

Basic and superordinate concepts = local metatopics: what the paragraph, page, or section/subsection is about. Challenge: they may not be explicitly stated in the text, but are vital for ensuring that concepts at all levels of abstraction are included in the index. Identifying superordinate concepts is particularly difficult because we don't normally think at that level of abstraction. 

Superordinate-basic entries are in the middle of the granularity spectrum. 

"If we start with the metatopic and follow each type of index entry in turn (metatopic–chapter, chapter–section, superordinate–basic, basic–contextual), we can see a complete hierarchy of concepts. The following example hierarchy never appears as such in the index, but is represented by successively more granular heading–subheading pairs. 

World War I, creation of modern America and (metatopic) Preparedness (chapter)
	military policy and (superordinate)
		militias (basic)
			inadequacy for wars (context)"

## Pan-granular indexing process

### Step 1: Metatopic entry
1. Create a heading for the metatopic, based on the title/subtitle/introduction/conclusion (no locator range). Reflect the content of the text and the word/phrase readers are most likely to look for. 
2. Then create a series of subheadings for the metatopic entry, where each subheading encompasses the theme of a single chapter, using the locator range for each chapter.

 This creates a high-level overview of the book. 
 
### Step 2: Chapter entry headings
1. Duplicate the metatopic subheadings and turn each into its own main heading, modifying wording appropriately so it can stand alone. 

Chapters titled "introduction" or "overview" or "conclusion" may be ok in the metatopic but can't stand on their own as headings, so remove them .

### Step 3: Chapter entry subheadings

1.  Move through each chapter, adding subheadings to the chapter headings based on the chapter section headings, modifying them as needed. Ignore sections marked introduction/overview/conclusions. 
2. Check the locator ranges for chapter sections. 


Do it as:

	subsection heading
		as [chapter heading]

Now you have a well-structured index to serve as a scaffold to integrate more specific entries into. 

[My thoughts: this process probably works really well for books whose structure anticipates the reader's needs effectively, but there's no discussion of that in this article.]

### If your text lacks section headings within chapters or has non-useful titles
1. Check the introduction/preface for a "what this book covers" section, which may introduce the main topics you can borrow from. 
2. Check the concluding chapter for a similar summary.
3. Review the beginning and end of each chapter for additional hints on chapter content. 
4. Skim the text to identify appropriate divisions. 

#### Time taken
Adds little additional time to the overall indexing process, as it is balanced by time saved during textual indexing and editing from working with an already structured index.

### Step 4: Textual indexing
1. Now start from page 1 and create bottom-up entries like always. If the concepts are already in the text, it needs no further breakdown. 
2. Remember to create basic-subordinate and superordinate-basic entries as you work. 

## Specificity: 
We want to perfectly represent the text's concepts, often by repeating terms from the text, but without copying so much that the index stops being a pointer to the relevant information. 

"Yeats was interested in adapting noh for his own aesthetic and political purposes rather than attempting an authentic recreation of it."

"Yeats
	noh, interest in"

but the sentence is about interest in adapting
[but apparently we can't say that because it would stop being a pointer, so we have to withhold info]

"noh, nature of interest in"

# Sassen (2013): History indexers reviewed
"Do readers care about indexes in history books?"

Cites studies finding:
* of 66 book reviews in Archaeological Journal, only 8 mentioned indexing
* of 206 reviews in *Choice*, 57 mentioned indexing, 40 including mostly brief evaluative remarks
* of 326 reviews in 11 journals, 54 included comments on indexing and only 34 were evaluative

"The goal of this study was to analyze reviewers' comments about indexes in history books."

From *Reviews in History*, chosen because it publishes lengthy reviews of 2-3k words. 1996-2013.

## Results

123 reviews with 143 comments about indexes. 12 mentioned an index's presence, 8 noted its absence, 131 were evaluative. 

13 comments on accuracy of indexes, 2 of which were actually about author errors. 

5 on the appropriate number of indexes.

67 on exhaustivity of indexes. 20 were about decisions made by the authors on the scope of their works. 

23 concerned indexes' usefulness. 

11 concerned value judgments. [these seem to be exhaustivity, actually]

## Discussion

"What do reviewers notice about indexes in history books? According to the results of this study, they assess exhaustivity, usefulness, accuracy and extensiveness most often. They also evaluate the types of indexes included, and the level of analysis of indexes."

"If an index to a history book provides exhaustive, accurate and useful access to names of persons, institutions, places, events and concepts, it is indeed fit for a discerning reader."

[I guess I wonder what the alternatives were—were there other aspects they could have mentioned, but didn't?]

# Chandler (1983): Indexes for local and family history: a user's view
"Considers the quality of indexes to local history publications, and their value; the different types of indexes to materials in libraries and record offices; local news papers as source of data for local historians; the various uses of indexes to family historians; the likely effects of computers on genealogical research."
