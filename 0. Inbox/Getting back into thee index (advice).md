I usually toggle into F12 to see what I'd been indexing just prior.

I prepare for it when I leave - I make mental notes before I step away. I also like to handwrite my notes. It gives me a break from Macrex.

However, I also try and finish sections before I break, so it can be easier to just start from a clearly marked breakpoint.

Good question, Elizabeth! I usually use the Macrex list command (F12 or ctrl-shift-Y in add mode) to see my last entries. That reminds me of what I was working on, and what page I was on if I forgot. (Ah, like Elena.) I also keep a Word file with time spent and pages so that tells me where I left off.

Don't tell the maximum efficiency indexers, but I'll sometimes re-index the last 2 pages. I often find more entries (my mind was getting tired!). But, I try to stop only at a chapter end for the day. Within the day, I stop and start and don't find it too bad for continuity. That's a tough one though, I think when I was marking up pages it was easy to go back and see what my mind was thinking about, but not so much when indexing directly from pdf to software.

Elizabeth, I don't know which program you're using for this assignment, but see if it has a similar command to see your recent entries.

I use PDF Exchange editor for reading pdfs. I sometimes look at the record of searches I have done.

I'm using Cindex for this one, and I think it has a recent entry sort order.

I also sometimes group on the last page number.

I usually highlight a couple of lines at the end of whatever I was indexing on the PDF - I also do this for when I'm jumping forward or back to see how many pages are left in a section/chapter

Nice idea, Elena.

This is really helpful, thanks all. A lot of strategies that hadn't occurred to me.

It makes my stopping point very clear.

Yes, Elizabeth - either page number sort or unsorted. Unsorted would include entries you've added that might be earlier page #s, depends which you find more useful. Sorted has a shortcut, but no shortcut to toggle between Alpha view and Page # order.

I mark up a printed pdf when I index, which gives me a quick check on what I was thinking. I know many indexers work directly on the computer, so that wont help them.

I highlight entries on my pdf for the same purpose, Charles.
