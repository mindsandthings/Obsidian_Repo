Funny enough the implosion of all the progressive political nonprofits over the past two years to endless purity test infighting has been great for explaining to people what consultants do. "Notice how the employees all believed this stuff since like 2016, but they didnt blow up then? And notice how every single one of these orgs hired a DEI consultancy team in 2020 and that is when things started?" You may not like the goal but the impact is definitely there!

I can't tell if it would be funnier for the DEI pandemic to have been a right-wing shadow op or an entirely self-inflicted wound

Its almost certainly self-inflicted but i sincerely hope there was a right wing operative trying to engineer it, just got lucky on the timing but doesnt know it, and feels like an absolute fantasy-cia level god right now.
