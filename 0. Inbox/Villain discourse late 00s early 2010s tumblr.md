> > not to post even _more_ Villains Discourse on main but it really bugs me how people read giving villains tragic backstories as inherently excusing their actions and/or demonizing trauma survivors.
> > 
> > the _actual_ message of Tragic Villains is (almost) _always_ “people who are never taught or given any healthy, constructive outlets for their emotions will often find _un_healthy, _de_structive outlets.” it’s that people who are traumatized and never learn how to cope with that trauma can become a danger to themselves and others. the message isn’t “trauma makes you evil!!!!” or “genocide is okay if you’ve been sad before!!!!” it’s “people _need_ compassion and _help_ to recover from trauma instead of becoming increasingly angry and harming themselves and others in the process.”
> > 
> > this site takes an alarmingly behaviorist and punitive approach to everything and it’s literally the most annoying thing. y’all have this concept that “if we just punish people hard enough, if we just scare them enough, if we just make them feel guilty enough.” that people just Do Bad Things Because They Do Bad Things, I Guess, and Because We Didn’t Threaten Them And Shame Them Enough. but humans are an _innately social_ species. at our very core, we _need_ compassion and kindness. we _need_ healthy relationships with other humans.
> > 
> > you can keep looking at traumatized villains and being like “haha this dumb pathetic sadboi thinks murder is okay because his parents died” but as a survivor myself, unaddressed/untreated trauma _absolutely can_ make you ragey and destructive. i was lucky enough to have support and eventually get the treatment i needed. but it’s not hard at all for me to imagine how, if that hadn’t been the case, that could’ve been me. obviously not on a movie-villain scale like murder or war crimes, but it’s so irritating _as_ someone whose trauma has always manifested as anger to watch people on this site be like “this is just bad writing!!! _real_ survivors/_good_ survivors don’t end up like that the writers just hate survivors and want the audience to condone murder!”

I don’t disagree with OP’s fundamental point. But I am having a moment of some kind of Feeling, having been around for various 00s and early 10s iterations where, my hand to god, _yes_ the arguments really _were_ more or less “genocide is okay if you’ve been sad before, and if you think the fact that this character tried to kill everyone on the cast means that it’s okay that the rest of the cast doesn’t like, trust or accept them, then _you’re_ a horrible person who just wants victims of abuse to suffer forever.” 

And I promise you a _lot_ of the discourse was _not_ more nuanced than that. I promise that I sat through a _lot_ of very passionate essays about how eg Loki’s attempt to genocide the rest of the Frost Giants was actually not any kind of moral problem because it was _actually_ Odin’s fault for lying about him being adopted, and people who didn’t find that compelling were just Moral Absolutists Who Didn’t Understand Trauma. 

Because being fucked up by a lie about your adoption is absolutely an excuse for genocide! And being socially rejected from a group is a completely reasonable motivation for wanting to not only murder them but frame them for your further crimes. 

Or that the Death Eaters were the _real_ victims because something something social stigma something something. 

And so on. And, crucially, that as a result, anyone who was still hurt by them, or who thought other characters had the right to, you know, not want to be in company with their abusers/to be angry at them/to not really prioritize the emotional wellbeing of someone who’d tried to kill them/etc, were themselves Actually The Abusive Ones, Really. 

Which, you know. Yeah does kind of also feel like a slap in the face when you yourself had a shitty childhood or were ostracized or whatever, and have at the same time come around to _not_ thinking “as a result, I am morally free to make others suffer.”  

And while I totally agree with the OP’s point that it has come to a point where there’s massive problems with simplicity the other way, I also don’t think one can ignore that history, or the threads of that which happen in real life, when engaging with the part where people are reacting the other way. 

Like full disclosure: my trauma absolutely manifests in rage and my damage in impulses to violence. But I also received most of my damage and trauma from _other people_ who felt ostracized and shut out and harmed, and who actively used that as an excuse for what they did, and then who also actively and deliberately used things like “you’re just all about punishment” as a way to dodge having to deal with the consequences of their actions. 

This is a thing that happens. And it can make one mighty unsympathetic to things that look like it in fiction, let me tell you - and make one even _more_ unsympathetic to the argument “but if you don’t think that Zuko _owes_ Azula a chance at redemption you are actually a horrible person who fails to appreciate that as a survivor of abuse herself Azula deserves a chance to be happy!” 

Or, for that matter, “if you are even ambivalent with Zuko’s own transition from imperialist, colonial aggressor to Member of the Gaang, you’re EVIL”. (And I say this as someone who is extremely fond of and attached to that character.) 

The idea that a tragic backstory is meant to excuse or force forgiveness for a character’s misdeeds isn’t actually something that people Made Up just to then reject and disapprove of the idea of changeability and improvement; it’s honestly been part of the go-to for lazy writing in mass media for quite some time. It’s also, tbh, something that abusers use in real life: “I had a horrible childhood, so you can’t hold me accountable for my actions.” 

I mean, hell: look at how fast the narrative about young white male shooters goes to “now what terrible life experiences could have made them do this thing, and how bad should we feel for them?” This is _also_ a thing humans do. Hell, it’s a thing some villain fans on this site still do. 

And both of those facts can make people who’ve had that used against them personally quite resistant to the idea of anything that looks like it. 

**Now of course this gets quite complicated if you approach it with anything more than pre-adolescent ethics:** as I said I agree with OP that there has been a swing to far too much comfort with “someone is bad forever” or “absolutely nothing even complicates bad behaviour (unless it’s MY blorbo, of course!)” and as ALWAYS in fandom there is no patience or comfort or engagement with the fact that the exact same story can mean different things to different people, and have different levels of engagement. 

And there’s definitely very LITTLE space for people like me who are literally stuck with “okay, no, on the one hand yes absolutely that shit that character went through is incredibly destructive and harmful and yeah I can totally see how they got there, and that is profoundly tragic and horrible, but also no THAT WAS STILL GENOCIDE/MURDER/ABUSE and the survivors have ZERO obligation to not want the perpetrators dead and it is NOT unreasonable for a survivor to refuse to even share the same air with them, even if I personally would like to see them find some kind of [contentment], stahp.” 

Or that one person’s “if this character DOESN’T get some kind of way to come to a place where they’re Okay, it feels like I’m being told I’m unsalvageable and bad” can quite literally be another person’s, “being asked to frame this story as being about that person’s suffering feels EXACTLY like being required to be more concerned about my abuser’s suffering than my own safety, _again”._ This totally split reaction can be a valid reaction to the same story, because that’s how stories work. 

(Competing access needs again, innit.) 

I think people are REALLY fast to leap on the bandwagon of “I will find a way to make my feelings about this piece of fiction into a moral imperative, where people feeling otherwise are not just Wrong, but somehow Bad”, and will latch onto any premise to do it, and all kinds of other human things. 

But I think part of maybe finding some way to STOP swinging from “if you think his Sad Life makes up for Anakin Skywalker’s acts as Darth Vader, you are a genocide apologist” to “if you don’t think Anakin Skywalker is Perfectly Redeemed you are a bully who hates trauma survivors” and then back and forth again is honestly being aware that at least part of each swing of reaction is rooted in the excesses of the other and figuring out how to engage with the actual complex problem, including that no fictional depiction is ever just One Thing because of what people bring to it.
