Sarah, I just installed Parallels and had the same issue with Macrex crashing after I choose a drive letter. Here's a workaround:


1) Right-click on the shortcut, select Properties, and select the compatibility tab. Click "run compatibility troubleshooter", and then "try recommended settings", then click the "test the program" box. This allows me to create a new index without crashing the program.


Unfortunately, it isn't a permanent fix - the compatibility troubleshooter lets you save the settings, but that doesn't fix the issue. It *only* works from the compatibility troubleshooter's "test the program" box.


2) However, once you have created an index to open via the compatibility troubleshooter, you can open it up directly via clicking on the index file in the file explorer (suggested to me by Matthew MacLellan in Chet Chat). Macrex by default keeps your indexes in your home directory (C:\Users\yourcomputername\Indexes or C:\Users\yourcomputername\mx9indexes).


If you have figured out any other alternatives, let me know!


I'm on a 2022 M1 Macbook Pro with Parallels 18, for reference.
