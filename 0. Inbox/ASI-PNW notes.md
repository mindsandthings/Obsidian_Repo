# Website and mailing list
Sam will bring Elizabeth on board as co-webmaster next week. 

Wanda has expressed a desire to step down as list manager. Sam will check with her on if she wants to transfer this to Elizabeth. 

Currently, members need to sign themselves up for the list and be approved by a moderator. Directions are included in chapter welcoming email. [Specific text was "If you haven’t already, I’d suggest subscribing to our regional PNW listserve.  Go to the “Contact Us” tab on our Chapter web site http://www.pnwasi.org/  for a link." --E]

Previously anyone could join the PNW-ASI listserv but a few years ago ASI said it had to be members only and Wanda had to clean it up. Reconciling the membership and listserv list is time-consuming.  [Do we get the membership list in a consistent format? I've made spreadsheets for similar repeating tasks --E]

Jim is the owner of the website hosting company we use, and is close friends with Wanda (who set up the original website?). 

# Programming

## In-person vs virtual
We discussed how in-person conferences have social and networking benefits that are harder to get for virtual conferences. Those benefits are particularly helpful for new indexers, but new indexers may be more likely to have time and money constraints that make virtual conferences more attractive. 

The 2023 conference will be virtual. We will look into ways to support informal social interactions among members to help take the place of in-person casual interaction. 

The Canadian Society for Indexers does a particularly good job making virtual conferences interactive. Someone suggested we contact Lisa Fedorak who is also an ASI member and ask her for ideas. 

It might be nice to do in-person conferences occasionally for special events, for example for the chapter's 30th anniversary in 2026. 

## Program co-chair
Need to recruit a co-program chair. Idea of asking Lisa Fedorak was brought up. 

## Newer indexers committee
It was suggested that we recruit newer indexers for a 3-4 person committee to discuss potential topics for the 2023 conference. 

## New ASI training course
The new ASI course will launch in Jul-Aug 2023 and might be a good short conference topic. Carolyn can potentially present on it. 

## Conference honoraria
$100/hour and will consider extenuating circumstances. 

## Informal spring meeting
Sam suggests we do an informal meeting in January or April-May and experiment with ideas for online social time. 

# Financial

If we do virtual meetings, we roughly break even on finances. If they're in-person we have to charge more because there are more expenses. Conference costs have also risen during the pandemic, so an in-person conference is also likely to be particularly expensive. 

Last year's expenses included $900 one-time expense for the website. 
Webhosting is an upcoming recurring charge ($90 every 2 years). 

# Call for nominations

Judy will draft an email inviting nominations and mentioning the committee and run by Elizabeth and Sam.
