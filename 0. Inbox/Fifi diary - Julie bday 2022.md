Dearest Diary, 

Today I set out upon my journal to that most vaunted of events: the International Fancy Fashion Exhibition, held in Boston! Truly I am the luckiest alpaca ever. 

12pm
Dearest Diary, 

Alas! Tragedy has struck. I set my purse down for only a moment and when I turned back it was gone—and my first-class plane ticket with it. 

I had already checked my luggage, so my outfits will arrive just fine—but what will I do? I have no ticket, no credit cards, and no ID, only spare change from my pockets. 

12:30pm
In despair and slight panic, I have spent half my spare change on coffee and chocolate. Whatever will I do? 

I will eat this chocolate. 

1pm
Buoyed by chocolate, I have used a precious quarter to phone Gator and ask her advice. She has reminded me that when one travels broke, one uses whatever means one has at one's disposal—because one, meaning me—is a resourceful member of the Resistance. 

Of course, she didn't put it like that. She said, "Feef, you don't have to travel first class. You planned to arrive in Boston ahead of time. You have a literal week to get there."

The obvious thing would be to tell my mother my purse was stolen and borrow money for the train. But a resourceful member of the Resistance would get to Boston on her own. I cannot live in my mother's shadow forever!

2pm
I only have enough money for half a train ticket. The train station ticket office has told me quite firmly that they cannot sell half a train ticket, as I am an entire alpaca. 

3pm
I have stopped in the chocolate store across from the post office to buoy my spirits again. 

3:05pm
I no longer have enough money to purchase even half a train ticket. 

3:30pm
Brilliance has struck me like a bolt of divinely inspired lightning! By pooling my money with traveling companions, I shall purchase cheap passage to Boston. 

6pm
I have found two stalwart bags of chicharrones who are also Boston-bound. Together we have been able to afford the cheapest of boxes. It is a tight fit, but we are on our way! Boston and my dreams, here I come!
