The paradox of intersectional spaces is that they really, really want to reduce people to their privilege.

The main problems with EA are that it is

1) a cult

2) that focuses on apocalyptic fantasies of vengeful AIs developing sentience

3) diverting the attention and resources of people with money and influence away from very real, very urgent problems, in particular climate change and (in the U.S. but presumably also other places) the partisan politics that prevent us from dealing with climate change.

These are not its only problems but they are bad ones. I’m glad the news coverage is hitting on #1 and #2 and I hope at some point it will hit #3 harder.

I did appreciate that EY posted in the EA forums jokingly taking blame for the current clusterfuck, because it’s at least partly accurate, even though as far as I can tell he did it preemptively to try to frame it as silly. Because...if you help found and remain a leader of a movement that someone directly cites as an inspiration and appears to actually have used to direct some of his decisions, and your movement has helped hype that person up and happily takes his stolen money, maybe you do bear some responsibility there.

I keep thinking I want to join mastodon or something, but then can’t imagine trusting people who follow me to be following me for any reason other than social politeness, or because it’s the thing to do, or because they haven’t realized that eventually I’ll slightly fail to connect with them in the way they want me to and ultimately become that person who doesn’t add significant value to a space but also doesn’t actually damage the space, which makes me actually worse than a predator because there’s no grounds for actually expelling me.

When the assignment instructions said “query your ‘client’ if you have any questions”, I was \*not\* expecting to get back a reply from the teacher when I did that telling me “I don’t have any more information about this assignment than you do” 

Not sure what’s going on behind the scenes there but I’m definitely getting the impression that everyone is abdicating any power or responsibility they have as hard as possible, and, tbh, I’m guessing it’s because the person in charge of all the other teachers is pulling the same bs she did with me

I would like:

\* To be the breadwinner

\* To go to work and come home and take care of my family

\* To provide

\* To know that my family is having a good time because of me

\* To be able to be proud

\* To have a job where I can do my job as a matter of course, without feeling under constant threat

\* To have the health I need to support my family

\* To be allowed to relate to other people in a way that includes basic respect (for example, to have it understood that I don’t casually request info just because I can, I request info because I need that specific piece of info)

But all of these things presuppose my having a different body, mind, social history, and partner.

I _would_ very much love having someone I can safely care about, and who will not get squirmy and avoidant if I express concern about them.

I’m just...really tired and disheartened that the available approaches to social justice are about voluntarily opting in to a system where (specific, highly selected kinds of) structural privileges are seen as removing the right to have access needs, or the right to not always share my thoughts for dissection, or the right to have access to deescalation strategies other than abject capitulation. I’m baffled by settings where no one seems to think this is harmful, or that it might affect anyone unjustly.

[](https://patchwork-something.tumblr.com/private/699746183775731712/tumblr_9xDEwb7aGxqZ754VQ "View post - November 1st, 12:12 PM")

I know someone who has a profound inability to either listen to other people or to consider whether her first interpretation of a situation might be wrong. To the extent that, if I described it, most people would likely assume I was exaggerating or being malicious.

It’s a perfect storm situation: she interrupts other people after a partial sentence, often with something unrelated, probably due to a combination of severe undiagnosed untreated ADHD combined with panicking when someone else is the focus of attention combined with what I suspect is untreated hearing loss (she’s one of the loudest people I’ve ever met and has gotten louder over the time I’ve known her) combined with an absolute refusal to consider whether she might be ever wrong. Her texts are typo-ridden and ambiguous to the point of being uninterpretable, both in her native language and not, although auto-correcting in the wrong dictionary doesn’t help, and neither do the uncorrected vision issues she’s described to me before (and apparently to optometrists without result). When other people text her (as you might do if you needed to say something to her that took longer than half a sentence), she misinterprets it as threatening, probably because she can’t interrupt. 

I had the misfortune to meet her in a professional context where I held relative power. Because of that, I worked very hard to be polite and professional and give her the benefit of the doubt. I suspect this was better than pretty much everyone treats her because she decided we were great friends, despite (or maybe because of) the fact that every interaction I had with her consisted of her rejecting every attempt I made to communicate. 

None of the social justice stuff I’ve run into acknowledges that you can have both structural privilege and some forms of actual power over someone and use them responsibly and have the outcome be a literally intolerable situation for you while they get to continue to exist in an imaginary situation where everything’s fine. I think I would trust social justice stuff more if it were more willing to acknowledge that if the only way to get someone to understand something like “lactose-free and dairy-free are different things, and this is important” is to aggressively interrupt them back over and over, then power and privilege are maybe not the most important concepts here.

Something I learned, from my 20s:

1) There are people who will absolutely judge you for every misstep, every failure to reach perfection, because their process of constructing who they are as a person depends on constructing others as lesser. It doesn’t take them energy to do this. When they have an opportunity to do it, they \*gain\* energy. They’re not let down or disappointed, because classifying others as deficient, imperfect, lets them see the world as they expect and want it to be: with them as good and solid and perfect and you as mildly contemptible, disregardable, unimportant. You have shored them up, but not in a way that they owe a debt to you or have to take you into consideration; instead, they can throw you away.

2) There is a separate set of people who genuinely believe that trying to avoid missteps is perfectionism and bad, and who will try to convince you to stop trying so hard, for your own good. The first set of people are just pretty standard narcissistic assholes. The second set of people present themselves as kind and supportive, and some of them genuinely believe they are being kind and supportive. Their actions involve pressuring you to make yourself easier for the first set to consume.

The first set tends to be weighted more male, but not exclusively so. The second set is almost entirely female. Some of them believe the first set doesn’t exist (or can’t affect you), and will continue believing that regardless of anything you say.

wish I could say “I wish I could connect to fandom in general and read fanfic specifically but something about my ability to enjoy it is broken, probably involving my ability to relate to other people" and have people understand that I am saying something about me is broken, instead of jumping to the conclusion I’m criticizing them

Running a small community whose members are all autistic has made me realize that some shitty NT behaviors aren’t shitty NT behaviors, they’re shitty behaviors that all people adopt as soon as they feel sufficiently stable and secure in a group to start trying to purge people they dislike, and the reason I almost never see autistic people doing them is because we're almost never the stable and secure ones.

I am still kind of horrified how difficult it’s been to get one of them to see how dangerous it is to push for a community norm of kicking people out based on personal dislike plus their own proximity to power. _Nothing_ about that ends well.

It’s the obligation to participate, combined with the very specific terms of participation: you must enter the contest having been entirely defined as someone who is transgressing by being there, not in the good sense of transgressing against bad people but in the bad sense of transgressing against good people.

(I always thought it was odd to have people fetishize transgression, back in the 90s and 00s. I think it was some kind of overlap with martyrdom, and it felt like an attempt to write a role for me as a pearl-clutcher and force me into it, even though I didn’t feel transgressed against, wasn’t clutching pearls, and was usually more similar in most ways to the person doing the transgressing. And now that transgression is increasingly equated not to bravely being yourself while the Mrs. Grundys of the world try to squash you but to merely being present while not being marginalized in the right ways, I find myself redefined as the transgressor. On one level, it’s a confusing switch; on another level, it’s an extension of the same thing: I am not marginalized enough to have value, because the definition of marginalization is controlled by the people who have the local power.)

# too many words, not enough time on Tumblr

@ceanothusspinosis asked me to explain how internet community harassment is spiritual abuse. long post is long, caveat lector, hit J to skip, you know the drill.

first, we need to define some terms. **spiritual abuse** is a specific form of emotional abuse that most often happens in religious communities and/or cults. it's a colloquial term, so there's no official definition of it.

## the best definition of spiritual abuse I can find is that it's **emotional abuse that uses your spiritual beliefs to make you comply.**

the classic examples of spiritual abuse are things like "a cult leader demands you give them your stuff/sex/personal information because God Wants You To", "your religion demands that you pray the gay away", and "the members of your religion shun or harass you if you break the religion's rules."

the thing that's uniquely damaging about spiritual abuse, beyond the usual consequences of emotional abuse, is that a spiritual abuser re-defines your most deeply-held beliefs _specifically_ to hurt you. if you want to, say, be a Good Christian, a spiritual abuser will tell you that being a Good Christian means giving up your freedom of choice, your sense of right and wrong, your right to your own thoughts, your consent, your personal possessions, and sometimes even your body. You have to choose- do you accept your abuser's definition (and let yourself be hurt), or do you reject it (and thus reject what you're being told are your most deeply held beliefs)?

this can get even nastier when an entire community is abusive, or when you _don't_ share the same beliefs as the spiritual abuser. you are under an intense amount of pressure to change your beliefs into a more _convenient_ shape, one that makes you easier to control. if you don't change your beliefs, they hurt you_._ if you don't let someone else define what's important to you, how you think, how you act? they hurt you. with every tool they have and with everything that matters most to you. over. and over. and over again. your only choices are to give in or leave your community. and both feel like dying.

_change your beliefs,_ the spiritual abuser says, _or you are Bad, and we must hurt you._

the really shitty thing about spiritual abuse is that it's not actually about any given belief, it's about control. it's about making sure the individual never questions the leader or the community. it's about keeping everyone in line. it's about giving the community a safety valve- somewhere to put all their rage at having to live up to an abusive religion, a target that they can hurt with malevolent glee. it will never end, because an abuser will never be satisfied with the amount of control they have over you.

you will always be asked to twist the things you believe into a shape that makes you easier to control, always asked to find some new thing that you're not allowed to enjoy, always told to hate a new group of people. it won't end unless you leave. and if you leave, there's the threat that they'll hurt you even if you never speak to them again, because you're Forever Bad Now.

## ...ideological internet harassment, _especially_ intracommunity harassment, works on the same goddamn principle.

let me give you an example. say you're a trans-positive feminist. you post something on twitter that's trans-positive. a TERF mob finds you and starts harassing you- arguing with you while constantly moving the goalposts, insulting you in every way imaginable, and maybe even sending you death threats. they'll accuse you of being an anti-feminist or a libfem; they'll tell you you're not really a feminist at all.

if you're a feminist, obviously, this is extremely distressing. for a lot of us Extremely Online Folks, our belief in justice and equality is _way_ more important than any religious beliefs we might hold. you're being told that you're bad at living up to your most fundamental beliefs, by a _huge_ group of people. and if you don't immediately apologize and go full TERF, they threaten to never stop.

there is an implicit ultimatum with TERF harassment: _change your most deeply held beliefs, or you are Bad, and we must hurt you._

if you don't change your beliefs, they hurt you_._ if you don't let someone else define what's important to you, how you think, how you act? they hurt you. with every tool they have and with everything that matters most to you. over. and over. and over again. even once the great mass of the group has found a new target, you'll still get some shit from the most fanatical haters. until you publically grovel or log off, they will keep hurting you.

and the more I think about it, the more I see the same pattern in just about every kind of intracommunity internet harassment. _change your most deeply-held beliefs, or you are an acceptable punching bag. let us define what's important to you, or you're Bad and we'll punish you._ and it's never about a specific belief- it's about control. it's about making sure that anyone who steps a little bit away from their specific microcommunity's consensus gets Punished. there's that same malevolent glee to it, that same pressure-release that lets a toxic community keep being toxic without turning that anger inward. and there's that same never-ending cycle of harassment, of some new Problematic thing that you have to hate, of someone who's ~the main character of twitter~ Forever Bad Now and Must Be Hurt.

you see it in queer communities. you see it in feminist and ~alpha male~ communities. you see it with TERFs and trans folks, antishippers and proshippers, tankies and anarchists. this kind of ideology-focused spiritual abuse is fucking _everywhere_, and if there's _any_ overlap between a community you're in and someone who has _any_ difference in strongly-held beliefs? you might fall victim to it.

the reason I've been thinking about it is that, as An Internet Creative Person, I'm _real_ likely to fall prey to this kind of harassment. if you ask for any kind of visibility, you make yourself a target. if you're part of any kind of ~community~ - and on the internet, "being visibly trans" counts- you make yourself a target.

...I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to avoid this kind of harassment. there are stories I've floated around writing that I've just avoided writing, because they will make people Mad At Me. fuck, I'm scared to write anything with a transmasc protagonist, much less one who isn't Traditionally Heroic. because i will get harassed for it. i'm scared about talking about the game i'm doing freelance work for, because some of the costume designs are.... Problematique. i spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to keep people on the internet from being mad at me.

## you can't negotiate with spiritual abusers. there is nothing you can do to make them not be mad at you. they do not care what you're actually doing or why you're doing it. they want control; they want a pressure release. you're just a means to an end.

and like, i knew this intellectually before. but framing it as spiritual abuse really drove it home for me, y'know? it's not just ~bullying~, it's not just ~being problematic~. it's a system of abuse i've seen before. i know how to deal with it- the only way to deal with it is Not Giving A Fuck What They Think Anymore and ignoring every word they say.

## The Helicopter Story

When I read the helicopter story, it felt like I was being trolled. I’ve had the experience sometimes of someone deciding that nonbinary, autistic, etc etc me would be a good person to cast as a stand-in for Square Boring Normie Culture so they can enact a scripted play in which they flood a space with hyperstimuli they’ve designed to provoke a disgust reaction, and then when I respond badly to being trolled, they go “oppressor!” to me and “haha, I grossed out the normie” to their peers.

That is what it felt like. I am not remotely surprised that the trans community was highly split on the story and a lot of them suspected a troll. The story evoked negative reactions in a large number of trans (and non-trans) readers, and when there is no other information available about a story or the author’s intent, people will infer intent from the story.

It hasn’t missed me that a lot of the people who had a similar reaction to the story were AFAB trans and NB people, or that the story’s protagonist was AFAB. Maybe, just maybe, it’s not a great idea to use someone of a different birth assignment as a metaphor for your own gender-related experiences. (I have seen exactly one person making this point, and I don’t know why I haven’t seen more. I don’t, by the way, mean that no one should ever identify with the gender-related experiences of someone with a different birth assignment; I mean that you should not _deliberately invent a fictional person of a different birth assignment in order to represent your own experiences_, any more than, say, you should invent a fictional person with a real-world disability you do not have to serve as a metaphor for your own experiences. There are real people with those experiences, and they would like to not be overwritten.)

The discourse surrounding the story is being fit into a “the internet attacks a trans woman for writing about her experiences of gender” frame, but some of the nuances are actually relevant here.

(And no, no one deserves to get harassment. Fall did not deserve harassment. The writers being harassed by legions of troll accounts right now - the three highest-profile of them being, incidentally, Black and Asian AFAB writers - likewise do not deserve harassment.)

## The drawbacks of anger, and some alternatives

A lot of things that are normal aren’t ok. It’s hard to notice this. We’re socialized to accept a lot of things that really ought to be unacceptable. When we try to object, we’re punished. Being punished for objecting is often humiliating and disorienting.

It’s hard to remember that these things are wrong even when others punish you for saying so. It’s hard to remember that you have rights when others act like you don’t.

One way to remember that things are wrong is to get angry about them. Feeling outraged can make it easier to hold onto your sense that, no, this isn’t ok, and yes, it is ok to object.

Unfortunately, the price of rage is high. Rage hurts. It’s physically unpleasant, physically exhausting, emotionally draining, and makes it hard to think clearly. The physical and emotional exhaustion from anger makes it harder to do other things. The fog of anger can lead to mistakes that make it harder to remember after the fact that you were justified in objecting. Rage is better than nothing, but there are other strategies that don’t hurt as much.

One thing that can help is to develop your understanding of the situation over time. If you learn to understand what you’re angry about and why, it can make it possible to use understanding rather than anger to stay oriented.

Questions like these can help:

-   What am I angry about?
-   Why am I angry about that?
-   What happened that I think is wrong?
-   Why do I think it’s wrong?

For instance, say I’m in class, we’re doing an activity, I’m not able to do the activity, and I’m feeling angry. We’re writing thoughts on big paper, and I can’t do handwriting well enough to participate. In that situation, I might think:

-   **Why am I angry?**
-   I’m trying to participate and failing over and over and that’s intensely frustrating.
-   **Why am I angry about that?**
-   Because I’m sick of being left out all the time.
-   **What happened that I think is wrong?** 
-   The teacher knew about my disability and didn’t do anything to accommodate it when they planned the activity. 
-   When I pointed out that I couldn’t participate, they didn’t do anything to fix it.
-   **Why do I think that’s wrong?** 
-   Because I have a right to be here, and the teacher is supposed to be teaching me. 
-   I’m a student here, and I have the right to learn the material and be part of the activities we’re using to learn it.
-   This is disability discrimination, and that’s wrong.

Then, the next step in using understanding rather than anger is to notice that something is wrong before you start feeling enraged. Sometimes that can make it possible to fix the problem without having to get to the point of outrage. It can also make it more possible to decide when to fight and when not to.

For instance, take the class activity. If I remember that I have the right to be there and that it’s the teacher’s responsibility to teach me, this might happen:

-   I go to class and see that there is big paper on the walls.
-   I remember that I can’t do big paper activities.
-   I remember that I have the right to participate in educational activities.
-   I remember that I have the right to learn the material.
-   I ask right away “Are we doing a big paper activity today? How will I participate?” 
-   At this point, I’m annoyed, but not outraged, and able to assert something without it hurting so much.

They may or may not respond the right way — and I might still get really angry. But if that happens, I can repeat the strategy again, figure out what I’m angry about and why. Then I can get further without depending on anger the next time. (Even when you can’t win or fix the problem, it’s still often possible to use that kind of strategy to stay oriented without rage. I have more posts in the works about that specifically.)

Anger isn’t a failure. It’s ok to be angry when unacceptable things are happening. It’s also ok \*not\* to feel physically angry. Anger hurts, and you don’t owe anyone that kind of pain. You don’t have to be pushed to the point of rage in order to be justified in objecting to unacceptable things.

Sometimes it might help to explicitly remind yourself of this. Some affirmations that have sometimes worked for me:

-   [I don’t have to hurt myself to prove that this is wrong.](https://href.li/?http://realsocialskills.org/post/147095418577/happiness-is-not-consent-to-injustice)
-   It’s still wrong if I’m calm. 
-   It’s still wrong if I’m not crying and shaking. 
-   It’s still wrong if my heart isn’t pounding.
-   Even if I’m ok, the situation isn’t ok.
-   Even if I’m ok in this moment, it’s ok to object to a situation that’s hurting me and/or others.

It also helps not to beat yourself up for getting angry. Anger in the face of outrageous things isn’t a failure. No strategy can completely replace physical outrage for anyone. Holding yourself up to impossible standards won’t help. Working on your skills at staying oriented in other ways will.

These strategies are harder to learn and harder to use. They also make it a lot more possible to resist and stay oriented without hurting yourself. It’s not all or nothing — any skills in this area help, and it gets easier with practice.

## Don’t order people to feel safe

Social justice workshops often open by demanding that everyone consider the space safe and put absolute trust in the person leading it. For instance, workshop leaders will often say things like “This is a safe space. No one will feel unsafe here — but you might feel uncomfortable confronting your privilege. Understand the difference between being uncomfortable and being unsafe.”

“Everyone will be safe” is a promise we can’t keep. “Everyone must feel safe” is a demand that we have no right to make.

No workshop is actually safe for everyone. Sometimes, people are going to feel unsafe. Sometimes, people are going to \*be\* unsafe. People who feel unsafe need to be welcome in our workshops — and all the more so, we need to welcome those who are taking significant risks in order to learn from us.

When we tell people who are feeling unsafe that it must just be their privilege talking, we make the space much more dangerous for everyone in the room. Sometimes, people who feel unsafe are responding to real dangers. If we demand that participants who feel unsafe ignore the possibility that they are right, we are demanding the right to hurt them. That’s not something we should ever do.

Feeling unsafe isn’t always privilege talking. It’s always a possibility, but it’s never the only possibility. Sometimes, presenters aren’t actually as knowledgable and perceptive as they think they are. Sometimes, presenters get things wrong in ways that make the space unsafe for the most marginalized participants in the room. Sometimes, participants are so used to being unsafe that they need a lot of evidence of safety before they’re willing to risk trusting someone.

One way this can happen is that sometimes participants are marginalized in ways that the presenter doesn’t understand. For instance, people presenting on white privilege don’t necessarily always understand the significance of ableism, people presenting on sexism and misogyny don’t always understand the significance of racism and antiblackness. No one has a perfect understanding of every form of marginalization, and we are better presenters when we keep this in mind. When marginalized people are taking risks in order to learn from us, we need to respect the risks they’re taking and not write them off as a privileged affectation.

This can also happen in other ways. We have power as teachers and presenters, and it is possible to abuse that power. Even when the people we’re teaching are more privileged than we are in every relevant way, it matters how we treat them. Being privileged in society is not the same thing as being safe in a classroom. We are all capable of making mistakes that hurt people, and when we make those mistakes, it matters.

People have the right to manage their own safety. Our students have the right to decide for themselves whether or not they trust us, and how far they trust us. They have the right to revoke that trust at any time. We do not have the right to demand that they make themselves vulnerable, and we do not have the right to demand that they allow themselves to be hurt.

People have the right to make up their own minds about how safe or dangerous something seems to them. Calling a space safe does not make it safe, and it does not give us the right to order people to feel safe. When we present, it’s never ok to demand that people trust us. Trust is always earned.

# too many words, not enough time on Tumblr

Radical feminism, if you look at what people were claiming to have been doing in the 70’s when it arose, was based on the idea that “liberal feminism” doesn’t fully challenge patriarchy at its “root” (where the word “radical” comes from.) In their heyday back then, they derided people who they thought wanted rights only as people who suffered from a failure of imagination—an inability to work for truly revolutionary change.

What they’re mostly known for now is for hating trans women, and that’s definitely part of why they’re... well, I was going to type “no longer ascendant” but I think there’s a definite resurgence. Anyway, why a lot of people don’t take them seriously any more. But a bigger reason I think they kind of fell apart as the Face of Feminism was because while they talked a big game about how women’s lives would be better after a full overhaul of society, they didn’t really have much clear and coherent to say about what should be overhauled and how.

Since they’d defined themselves in opposition to a movement that focused only on women’s “rights,” their answer was usually that they wanted women’s “liberation.” But what is liberation? How do you know you have it? Are there sex workers once women are liberated? (They thought no.) Are there trans people? (They thought no.)

So my question here is the same. I can look at what rights are enshrined in law for me as a disabled person and decide for myself if I think my rights are adequately protected. (No.) I can ask the same question about people who need supports and services I don’t need or use. (Very much no.)

But how do I know what “justice” is? How do I gather when it’s achieved? How, especially, do I make sure my group doesn’t splinter over differences in priorities?

I notice there that there’s some references to disabled people being inherently anti-capitalist. I don’t really understand what that would mean... capitalism is an invention made by people, so it seems weird, like calling people “inherently” anti-Lego or something. But I agree that a lot of the way capitalist society is set up harms disabled people, so... I guess that’s one point I kind of understand?

The rest are kind of a mess, though. Prioritizing the most marginalized sounds good, but for one thing how do you know who is most marginalized? My worry would be that that prioritizes the most VISIBLY marginalized, which can be a different thing (and just collapse into the loudest, too.) And for another, sometimes depending on the goal, “progressive stacking” can be counterproductive. If you DO end up working on a rights issue, like making comments on proposed legislation or something, sometimes you may be better off having documents crafted by people with expertise and experience, even if they happen to be privileged in x y or z ways.

So these are my questions. How do we make sure that we’re clear and give detail about what our priorities are? Because in my experience, when we’re not, we end up doing a bad form of leftism that becomes about purity, not about results.

And the worst case scenario is it becomes like radical feminism. That old outmoded theory best known for who it hates, not for what it wanted.

# too many words, not enough time on Tumblr

> ## Excerpt
> Follow @patchwork-something and get more of the good stuff by joining Tumblr today. Dive in!

I’m writing a submission instead of an ask because I have no idea how long I’ll ramble. I think you might have thoughts about this, but please don’t feel pressured to write a response or even post this. 

I’ve noticed this…trend, although I don’t think that’s the right word, of people using the concept of intersectionality to essentially tell people “if your experiences as a marginalized person aren’t intersectional, then they don’t matter.” Of course not in that language, but essentially…if you’re marginalized on one or a few axes, but privileged on some others, your experiences as a marginalized person don’t matter. We don’t want to hear them. You need to shut up and let other, more marginalized people speak. Yeah, it’s the “Oppression Olympics” we’ve grown to know and love, but it’s this incredibly insidious type that strips marginalized people of the right to so much as talk about the hurt they’ve experienced unless they acknowledge that they don’t have it “as bad” as other, more marginalized people lest they be accused of, God forbid, _centering themselves_ or _taking up too much space_,like a horrible, self-centered liberal.  

Basically…the right to talk about your hurt has become a limited resource, and anyone who talks about their hurt who hasn’t met a certain quota of suffering is taking a platform away from another person who deserves it more. Every step of the way you have to grovel and qualify that yes, you know you’re privileged, because how dare you talk about the oppression you’ve faced as a trans person without acknowledging how good you have it compared to other trans people - that’s not very intersectional of you. You’re not allowed to want your experiences to be valued. You’re not allowed to want your insights to be valued. You’re not allowed to want a seat at the table. The activism that’s supposed to be for you _isn't_ for you. You’re not allowed to want it to be for you. You’ve had your day. You’ve said enough. You have nothing else to say. 

& one of the problems, IMO, is that people throw around these phrases and terms like “amplifying marginalized voices,” “centering yourself,” “taking up too much space,” “talking over marginalized people,” “using your privilege as a platform,” without anyone knowing what that actually looks like. What responsibility _do_ we have toward other marginalized people who are marginalized on different axes than us? What responsibility does, say, a marginalized celebrity have to use their platform for intersectionality, compared to a marginalized individual running a blog with a thousand, five hundred, one hundred followers? If you’re offered an interview to talk about your experiences as a marginalized person, should you decline it lest you take that opportunity away from someone more marginalized? If you take said interview, can you spend it talking about your experiences, or does that make you a bad ally and selfish? 

Another problem is that we use these terms, “marginalized” and “privileged,” as antonyms, and unless we’re talking about a specific instance of intersectional issues (i.e. cis gay people, white disabled people, etc.), we have no words for the massively complicated and messy web of factors at play in any given marginalized individual’s life - which honestly might not be an issue if people on this website especially stopped treating lived experiences and SJ terminology and theory as basically the same thing. 

Sure, maybe I’m ignorant and self-centered and too privileged to see that goddamn, there are way worse problems out there, and maybe it’s not at all that difficult to acknowledge your privilege every time you open your mouth, but it does get tiring to feel like you’re nothing more than a tool; that all you’re good for, all you’re here for is to use your privilege as a tool, and that your experiences and insights and your _pain_ as a marginalized person aren’t cared about or valuable. Don’t expect anyone more oppressed than you to care about you. Don’t expect anyone more oppressed than you to value you. You’re not allowed to so much as _want_ that. 

\====

(above is a submission, this is my reply)

Absolutely. That and… if you feel pain, UNLESS you can somehow trace it to marginalization, you’re weak and need to suck it up.

Which is quite honestly fucked. Pain is a part of life, and I’m way more comfortable with people who say “there will always be some forms of suffering” than with people who seem to think there won’t, but… pain is different for everyone, and not everyone feels the approved pain over the approved things. And we should still care about them.

There’s a limit to how much energy we can put into other people, and it should be okay to say we’re running low on juice, but I really dislike the way that instead of saying “compassion fatigue imminent… _must nap and view cat memes_…” we say, like “can’t care about white men right now.”

_**That’s not the actual problem.**_ Or if it is, you have some shit to sort out, tbfh.

# too many words, not enough time on Tumblr

---
part of my stress comes from watching how cis women and AFAB nonbinary people in the autistic community respond when obviously autistic women\*, often women who aren’t aware they’re autistic themselves, do ignorant things out of good intentions.

when my community responds to them by perceiving them as horrible outgroup oppressors, they’re missing something important about how some kinds of autistic naivete work, and missing something important about how maybe the reward for trying really hard to do a good thing should not be “you’re a horrible person.”

the specific values and positions of neurodiversity culture are not inborn. enculturation is a process. some people are trying their hardest to get some kind of mental footing that will enable them to understand the social world, and will make mistakes along the way.

the drive toward compassion and accuracy that led me to where I am today was present when I endorsed views I now think are wrong. it's present now, even though I’ll probably realize in the future that some views I hold now are wrong.

there’s a distinct type of communal harm done when we decide that intent is irrelevant full-stop. intent isn’t relevant to judging whether someone’s actions hurt someone, but it’s sure as hell relevant to not compounding harm.

intent matters in communities because if it doesn’t matter at all, mistakes get punished in exactly the same way that malice does. a community made of people with substantial chronic trauma from having maliciousness incorrectly attributed to them should not be ensuring that same trauma happens to people who aren’t part of that community.

\*Some of them will probably later realize they’re nonbinary or trans, but at the time they’re doing the ignorant things, they’re being perceived as women, and I’m pretty sure that plays a role in how they’re treated.

When you know things aren’t okay and you need help, and the response is for people to tell you that you’re great as you are, it’s a headfuck.

In the 90s in my circles there was a kind of personal-growth emphasis on the catharsis of realizing that you were good and okay underneath. Generally it was pushed in the absence of meaningful support and sometimes as a substitute for accountability.

I think it had some bad effects and wound up with people kind of emotionally jerking off to the sensation of catharsis, and now we’ve managed to replace it with catharsis via confessing privilege-as-original-sin and that also has bad effects.

I think I’m hitting the age where I’m expected to have gained enough informal behind-the-scenes interpersonal power to give it away freely, which is also the age where the pressure for women to be less visible intensifies. The fact that I’m not doing that reflects the fact that I don’t the kind of power necessary to do that for other people (since I don’t have that kind of power for myself, either). But I suspect my lack of power is just going to be interpreted as gatekeeping.

I’ve sometimes been an official mod in places where I’ve had backup and wasn’t the sole person responsible. Responding calmly to aggression didn’t take nearly the same toll on me that it does when I don’t \*officially\* have any power but am actually the only person responsible for ensuring a functional social space.

I think the next time I do this, I’m going to try to be very clear from the start that I’m actually running it, and I’m just going to try to deal with the fact that signaling that I have power I might act on lets people resent me even more.

I just don’t know. I’m hyper-aware that I’m bitter, and that no one likes a bitter ~woman~ person; but I can’t find my way through to being expansive and forgiving and welcoming, because my direct experience with doing that is that it doesn’t result in people going “oh, maybe I should give the benefit of the doubt in return and help make this a space that’s better for people in general”, it results in 1) being taken for granted and 2) watching the space get worse because people who behave poorly get less pushback.

The solution, I think, is for me do the thing that everybody wants someone else to do and either expel people who behave badly from those spaces or cause them to behave better, but I actually literally don’t have have the power to do that. 

\*Everyone\* thinks that being treated well is what they deserve, and that’s true. But it’s also true that when it happens, especially in spaces where people are inexperienced or don’t have extensive skills for getting along with others, it happens because someone is actively managing their own frustration responses.

We know that masking is a major predictor of suicidality in autistic people; why can’t we make that a major tenet of of our platform in general, and acknowledge that many of the people who are being forced into masking have never had access to the ability to be seen as disabled?

mostly I would like for people to recognize that social connections, in the sense of having friends and being able to trust that if you lose your friends you’ll be able to make more friends, are a consequence of some types of privilege that 1) are actually real and 2) are not replaceable by other forms of privilege.

Social rejection sometimes involves a lot of very subtle cues, and when it does, those are sometimes a predecessor to someone becoming suddenly, sharply furious. Sometimes those subtle cues are just the absence of mild positivity. It’s difficult to talk about to third parties, who often want unambiguous proof that someone doesn’t want you around. This has been especially common for me with psychotherapists. I don’t want to annoy people with my presence; I want to be a contributing group member who helps make other people’s lives better. I think I would have had more luck figuring out how to do that effectively if people were more willing to believe that sometimes I’m not doing it effectively.

One of the weirder consequences of purity and harassment culture is that I now feel like I have to talk about “support marginalized people” like I’m not marginalized in any way, even though if you go by what’s usually seen to count under either a social justice or a corporate diversity framework, I fit into at least three groups, and disability in particular has hugely (and negatively) affected my past and present experiences.

If I were better at dealing with attacks and more willing to be a jerk, I would talk about being marginalized even when a way I’m marginalized is being conspicuously omitted from discussions of marginalization. If I didn’t care about whether a space needs to be tolerable for other people to be in, I’d derail other people’s discussions issues that have personally affected them with “okay, now imagine being \[marginalization I have but you don’t\].”

I would actually really like spaces to be tolerable for other people to be in, and for me to be in too. But I don’t know of any way to get there from here, since the only way to legitimately object to something someone else does in the name of justice is to win the “the marginalized identity I have and you don’t outranks all the marginalized identities you have” game, and that game requires subtle social maneuvering ability that I don’t have.

There’s a phenomenon for some autistic people where intelligence is the only thing that other people value about them. (There’s a lot of room to break down what’s meant by intelligent. I’m using it here to mean “the combination of particular abilities and social presentation that results in other people attributing the poorly-defined quality of intelligence to you”. The conflation of this with value as a person sucks and is terrible for people who don’t have that combination of abilities and social presentation, which is a very bad problem but not the one I’m focusing on in this post.)

​

If an autistic person is smart enough or good enough at academics, they may also grow up with cultural messages about how once they get out of high school and get somewhere that intelligence is genuinely valued, they’ll have a place and a community and people will like and care about them, and they’ll be meaningfully socially included. (For autistic boys especially, this is also often packaged with a promise of romantic and sexual partners.)

​

But there’s no autistic paradise. There’s nowhere to go where people won’t judge you negatively for not being good at social stuff, even when that difficulty is not your fault and not something you can change. This is true even in all-autistic spaces, although the definition of “good at social stuff” isn’t always the same.

​

Occupations that make a lot of money, like tech, also tend to be increasingly occupied by neurotypical people who are better at being liked. Someone who’s perceived as smart + likable tends to get more rewards than someone who is smart but not liked.

​

If you are an autistic person who has been highly valued for intelligence and nothing else, and you look around at the people competing at your same level, the neurotypical people who got there will have gotten there with a combination of intelligence and neurotypicality. People who aren’t considered as smart as you are doing as well as you are jobwise and are usually more socially included.
