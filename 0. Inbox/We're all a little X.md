Placeholder about “we’re all a litte \[x\]” and how there’s a thing in normie culture of saying fluff and fuller to indicate non-hostility (for example, the habit of saying “I understand” in trying to make empathy noises at people, but you really don’t at all understand.)

And the point is to on the one hand not actually indicate non acceptance (by normie standards) while not having to actually engage on the topic, because actually engaging the topic is actually some kind of social third rail. It’s a conflict minimizer, though it rarely fills that function well except in spaces where \[x\] is outnumbered by normies. Another Normie would get the message to accept the empathy noises and shut up about the topic.

And a ton of the empathy noises aren’t really about actually displaying true empathy or understanding as much as they are about displaying that you know the rules and can be counted on to keep them, without ever speaking the rules openly, which would break the rules.
