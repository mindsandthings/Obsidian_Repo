zI'm Elizabeth, and I live in the San Francisco Bay Area. I took AI's module A
I'm taking the UC Berkeley course in indexing, and I hope to go into freelance indexing or taxonomy development. Psychology, health, disability. 

I have a background in information science and in research psychology, and I used to work as a data manager and project manager on research studies but more recently I've been writing fiction and nonfiction, and I've also done some editing.

Larry D. Sweazy - author and indexer - spoke at one of the confs AELfwinna attended - See Also Murder, See Also Deception - indexer in N Dakota back in 1960s

In history, assumption is that the author is the fact checker; in other disciplines copy editors play more of a role. 

Jolanta raises q of who to prioritize - people who've read vs are just coming to it

give yourself 2 weeks to do practice indexes to force yourself to finish them, then put on peer review listserv

Jolant a- in regional groups they will peer review by having 10 people read an index in advance and discuss it at a meeting

scholarly is more gnerous with index size

doing good glosses for local history - many people sharing names

avoid commas in subheads

mention of disagreement of opinion in the indexing community about what to do with a three-page digression in a thirty-page span - cover it? or omit it? 

AElfwine asks if the indexing style has changed as people work on index cards, since you don't want to change all those hand written cards
