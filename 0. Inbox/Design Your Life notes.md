I believe that climate change and ecological collapse are the most important issues facing humanity, full stop, and that it is urgent to address them.

I enjoy meeting with people when I know that they can emotionally and socially handle any small missteps I might make, and when they are able to communicate clearly in words and clarify when I need a response, and when they actually genuinely want to work with me and are not just pretending to. I like meeting with them when their willingness to work with me has not been determined by either their dislike of me or by a situation where my goals require obtaining their compliance. 

Do I really like writing?
Yes, I like it when I have time and space and support to make a really good product, and when I can ask questions and get help. 

Do I like indexing? Maybe! It's hard to tell. I think I'll like it if I can devise a way to keep track of where I am, and see just my current relevant entries. I'm not sure indexing software is designed to let me do thatâ€”to let me *see* only the parts that are most relevant to the current section. 

I have to be able to communicate with people. They have to be able to communicate with me within the range of ways I have for communicating. I have to be able to communicate my *concerns* to them, and they have to be willing to take in those concerns and not just ignore them in the hopes of not having to think about them. 

I need an academic clientele, but *not* a tech clientele. 

I need to try different *types* of clients (and of indexes), and attend to my hit rates. 

Odyssey plans for next 5 years:

1. Work part-time indexing and part-time writing. Make money and shop my book around. Write another book too. 
- other options under this: do some other kind of editing work full-time or part-time. 

1 yr: finish book, start another; finish course, make marketing plan, market
2 yrs: continue marketing and doing indexes and establishing clients
3 yrs: same

Questions:
1. will I like it?
2. is there work for me? 
3. will I be good at it? 
4. can I balance these two? 

2. Go back to data management or some tech field. 

Questions:
1. What kind of re-skilling would I need? Are there still jobs in small data?
2. Will there be jobs with coworkers I can tolerate?
3. 

3. Go back to school in some completely different field. Maybe engineering. Maybe get a PhD in Info Sci.

Questions this plan addresses: 

WHAT I WANT IS TO FUCKING LEAVE
I HATE THIS SITUATION I AM DROWNING

I think I am desperately lonely and I want a family of my own, with children. 

I want to learn to write *easily*, not *better*. Not easily and *worse*, but easily and *as well*.
