1. Notice when I am Inputting, and be clear on the goal. Is it necessary distress management? 100% fine. 

2. Are the topics I'm inputting making me depressed? 

2. Don't let Input do Learner's job. If it's information I need to learn carefully and deeply, then I need to do it with studying, not browsing. 

3. Be careful not to let Input over-task Responsibility. Postpone the decision about whether to commit to something until later, when I'm processing all new inbox items in the light of my existing commitments. 

4. Is Intellection getting enough out of this? Am I actually talking/thinking about things with other people?
