When it's futuristic, there's a grief process: you have to actually replace it with something 
"There has to be a different future you can see that you will latch onto, otherwise you're not going to be able to create the future that you want"

Usually the biggest problem is that we haven't grieved the future that we see, so we're still hanging on.

"When I think of it in terms of wasting time, then other people's plans bother me a lot" then she thinks of it as her job is to be the best sister in the world instead. "In the moment, what does 'the best' mean?" Have to shift your filter. At any given moment, any particular strength can be behind the wheel - you can shift which one. There just has to be an intention behind why. 

If you can proliferate enough potential scenarios then you can feel prepared for what can happen. 

Have to let go, can't expect other people to hold to your standards, it's just difficult. 

High futuristic, low adaptability: you have to walk yourself back to the pain of today before you can get over it. 

Don't over-tie things to one outcome - thing X you hoped for is not necessarily part of Thing Y.
