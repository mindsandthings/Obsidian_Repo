I forgot. 

We forget. 

We made a decision to talk and we didn't. 

We have to do the effortful endless system meeting first or do nothing. 

We can't proceed as if we're all in agreement. We haven't agreed on who we are. 

We don't trust ourselves to not be making shit up. To imagine someone said something because it's a thing that could be said. 

We want out of all of this

I'm bored and I'm lonely and I'm trapped. 

I'm always trying to get out to move to go. I'm so godawful bored. Don't want to do a life of indexing want to go places see people. 

Want our head fixed, to stop hurting, sick of waiting and waiting and waiting

Hate being trapped into a middle aged woman

Hate this layout in front of me, all women forever, can't be a man. 

You've got to be trans or something, got to come out to let it go. 

You have to get somewhere affirming, somewhere you can be rough and gruff and not have to be the mom.  

Need people who will leave space for me to be me

Not a queer space that desperately needs for me to be Girl

I feel settled and I don't like it
