Hyacinth can't find a place: he's succeeded primarily because he's amiable and puts up with pretty much whatever, but he's not particularly talented at spellwork and doesn't seem to enjoy it. He's a gateway specialist, meaning that he mostly fixes problems that have already been worked out, and has access for a ton of safeguards for if he screws upâ€”at least for the actual gateways. He formerly worked in a family with several gateway specialists. 

He got put in charge of the project after the original spellworker bailed, probably because the project was a bad idea and everyone knew it. Maybe he was looking for a new direction; maybe he was the only one too amiable to refuse. Her impression of him is that he doesn't cause friction when friction is needed, preferring to shove everything under the carpet: he ignores problems. Which means that he's risky.
