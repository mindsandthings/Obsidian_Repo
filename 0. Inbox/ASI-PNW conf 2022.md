figuring out what she wants form her work. 

extensive history with people recounting other people they know

likes to look at a page and not see a lot of mess - not a lot of commas, not lines varying widely in length, fewer see references and more double-posting. Quotes someone "A consistent index allows the reader to trust the index." 

## acronyms etc: 
Initialisms are not acronyms - they're LOL, IMO, CAT scan, MRI

Editors firmly want everythign spelled up, but this is not how modern readers loko things up. 

Put in as the modern reader would look for them. 

Big indexes, use a see. but she prefers to minimize so reader doesn't have to run around index a lot. 

"Always two points of entry" - for each item

# Google
"Google gave me the courage to break the rules" - looking at list of top 100 searches, people don't enter in indexing format

[I mean, obviously they don't, they're not trained to enter information in the same way they'll look for it. If they were entering stuff for other peopl eot find they might put the most standardzied part first.]
