-- do I need to add back in arcs for the secondary characters? (yes)
-- I dropped the "B wants to solve the ghost girl mystery with the wisdom of age" thread. Do I want to take it back up?
-- more focus on Summerstart festival, show it throughout
-- can I get the reception scene to do more, backstory-wise?
-- Hyacinth and the portal project still feel underdeveloped
-- so do B's thoughts on them while she's in the basements
-- maybe make a list of continuity touchstones? The summer start festival, Aimee's faeriesonas/humansonas, something for Bellflower?
