When a main heading includes a spelled-out proper noun and its acronym in parentheses (or vice versa), a cross-reference should be provided from the non-preferred form to the preferred form, unless both fall very close together in the index.


[19:18] Sylvia Coates: To answer your question--it depends. It will depend on how much depth the issue 
is discussed and also will depend on what is discussed in the rest of the text. Let me explain, in the 
scenario you describe it would probably be OK to leave out the information on the birds regarding their 
death rate. On the other hand, it would be just fine to include it because the topic is discussed even if 
briefly. You don't necessarily need to have a percentage, only that it is discussed. This type of thing is 
going to be a judgment call on the part of the indexer.
[19:19] Sylvia Coates: Will the reader probably come across the death rate when they read the 
information on birds anyway? If so, and if the topic is just briefly mentioned in passing, it would likely be 
just fine to leave out of the index.
[19:19] Sylvia Coates: However, if it is unlikely that the reader will fine that information unless it is 
specifially included in the index, it should probably be added as an entry.

[19:19] Elizabeth Bartmess: That makes sense, thank you
[19:20] Sylvia Coates: The other thing to consider is this--is the information that important in the scope 
of the entire text or not?
[19:20] Sylvia Coates: Is it something which you can expect the reader to want to find or not?
