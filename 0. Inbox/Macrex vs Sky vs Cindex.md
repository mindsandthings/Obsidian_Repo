[DO NOT QUOTE. she also says: I prefer my other comments on this thread be kept here. I have to maintain a good relationship with all three software vendors and heaven forbid it one of them should read sometime taken out of context and want to scold me for that! I let all three of them review the Software Solutions article prior to being printed so I'm very careful about what I say publicly :-). Seriously, I'm happy to discuss anything but am cautious about keeping things in context. All three of these programs are excellent and of great value to the indexing community.]

Your reasoning is interesting. Though, if you don't mind my saying, it does reflect the fact that you are thinking like a beginner indexer instead of an experienced one. Please understand that no insult is intended by that comment. I only say this because I've had the opportunity to examine each of the big three software programs and to observe that they each reflect a certain approach to indexing. 

For example, Macrex is particularly suited for scholarly indexing in a way that Sky is not. It doesn't mean that you can't index scholarly material using Sky but only that the Macrex interface is particularly suited for the indexing process that efficient scholarly indexing demands. Macrex was written by the husband of a scholarly indexer and that heavily influenced the features of that program. 

Cindex was written by the husband of an indexer who engages in a lot of medical indexing and reflects an interface suited for that. Though again, many scholarly indexers do use Cindex just as many medical indexers use Macrex.

Sky was written by an engineer who does not have an indexing background. As a result, while Sky has a more "familiar" user interface to new indexers there are aspects of the program which are outside of the usual indexing conventions. For example, the use of Parent and Child entry terminology which reflects software language but not indexing language. There are many such examples throughout the program though I finally talked Kamm into changing how he labels page reference formats from "Aggressive" to Chicago Style etc. 

Many of the differences between the three programs are quite subtle. They all perform the same general functions but their user interface encourages the user to use a slightly different indexing process. And some of these indexing processes are more efficient than others. I've used all three programs and they each absolutely facilitate specific indexing processes.
