(Becca Syme video)

"part of the reason we get overwhelmed is out brains are wired to have certainty on less information"

overwhelm from trying to make a pattern explicit you can only sense in intuition, or with some strengths you want to go from uncertainty to certainty with a particular strength but need more time to think and feel pressured to go faster

overwhelm when imbalance - intellection has too many thoughts on the tracks, or too much info available to Input and can't take in and categorize and process

overwhelm when either too much to do or not enough/incomplete/faulty data
